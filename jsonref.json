But it is not formally hypothecated, he confirms. He says it would not be right of the health budget to fall if the levy raised less money than expected.Q: Why did you decide not to scrap the health and social care levy? Sunak says he thought it was right to have a dedicated funding stream for health and social care. And it is a progressive measure, he says. Q: Why is it important to have the national insurance threshold at the same level as the income tax threshold? Sunak says that was a manifesto commitment. He says it simplifies the system.Sunak says he does not think it has been cut. He says some agencies are getting more money for enforcement. They are trying to work out where it is best spent, he says.Sunak does not accept that. Q: But you say you are a tax cutting chancellor? Sunak says he has not said that. But he has said that, going ahead, his priority is to reduce taxes. Q: The NAO says between £12.4bn and £20bn has been wasted in emergency Covid schemes. The Treasury is complacent about fraud, isn’t it? Sunak does not accept that. During the pandemic the priority was to get support where it was needed. He could have put in more fraud checks. But it would have taken “weeks and weeks and weeks” to get money out to people. At the time businesses were saying they neeed money within hours to avoid laying people off. He says they are still pursuing fraud. They will get fraud levels down to levels that are acceptable, he says. Dozens of people have been arrested, he says.Sunak says it is hard to know what will happen to energy prices in the autumn. Q: You have chosen to put 1.3 million people into absolute poverty. Sunak does not accept that. He says he has chosen to help people, reducing by a third the impact of rising prices. But prices are a factor outside his control. He accepts that choices are made. He suggests Eagle would have made a different choice, choosing not to help 30 million people by cutting their taxes. He says he is is trying to adopt a responsible approach to borrowing, while providing support fairly. He says he does not think extra borrowing would have been responsible. That would have been inflationary, he says.Sunak says there are operational factors. He says it takes time to uprate benefits. And one system can only be uprated once a year. But he also says this would have required more borrowing. And he says he did not want an irresponsible approach to borrowing. Q: But you chose to lower taxes. Sunak says the income tax cut applies in a different year. Sunak accepts that another chancellor might have raised benefits instead of cutting national insurance. But he says he took the view that other measures were in place to help people on benefits. And he says, overall, the measures are progressive. UPDATE: This is from the i’s Paul Waugh. But what was in the spring statement for people not working, he asks. Sunak says most people on universal credit are in work, or can work. For people who cannot work, there was an extra £500m in the household support fund. Q: The OBR said that uprating benefits in line with the present rate of inflation would cost £11bn. So £500m is a small amount. Sunak says there are other measures too. The local housing allowance has gone up, and that is worth £600 to 1.5 million people. There is help with council tax payments. And the energy measures disproportionally help low-income households, he says. But Stride repeats his point – he says the low-income group are getting less help. Sunak says these are all choices. He chose to help people with fuel duty, and to cut income tax. “We have not gone down the route of austerity,” he says. They could have scaled back on investment. But instead they chose to raise the money to fund this spending. As for whether inidual measures are progressive, he says he is “very confident” they are. To deal with Covid, he put up corporation tax, with the largest companies paying more. And he froze the income tax personal allowances, which many people recommended as a progressive way to raise money. It raises the most money from high earners. Addressing the health and social care levy, he says he could have used VAT, income tax or national insurance. VAT would be regressive, so he ruled that out. Income tax was potentially more progressive than national insurance. But there were problems with it, like it not being a UK tax any more. And no one can say national insurance is not progressive, he says. And, turning to last week’s tax cut (the national insurance threshold increase), this was described by the IFS as the best way to help low and middle earners. So that was a progressive way to reward work through the tax system. And he says last October the universal credit taper rate was cut. That helped the lowest earners, he says.Q: Why did you announce an income tax cut for 2024 now, when there is so much uncertainty about the forecasts? Sunak says he set out the direction of travel in the autumn he said in future he wanted to cut taxes. He says he wanted to give people a sense of direction. And this was also helpful “because it creates a discipline”, he says. He says this would help when he came under pressure to increase public spending. Q: So this will make it easier for you to resist pressure to increase public spending. Sunak says that’s a “fair summary” – although he says public spending is already due to increase in this parliament, in real terms.These are two of the recommendations put to government by Huw Merriman (Con) and Darren Jones (Lab), who are the respective chair of the Commons transport committee and the Commons business committee.

Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph:  Christopher FurlongGettyThe mayors of Manchester and Liverpool will seek a post-Brexit “resetting” of ties with Ireland as they begin a two-day trip to Dublin on Monday.The visit by Labour mayors Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram comes at a time of poor relations between Ireland and Britain amid the ongoing EU-UK dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.Speaking to The  ahead of the trip, they sought to draw a distinction between their cities in the northwest of England – which have strong social and economic connections to Ireland – and the UK government led by Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson.Mr Burnham said: “When people in Westminster speak, they don’t always speak for us. I can imagine how in Ireland some people might think that they do, or they might think, ‘What’s happened to the northwest, has it changed?’“Obviously, we’re coming over to say that we haven’t changed. We don’t want to see some of the nonsense in national politics disrupt our relationship with Ireland.”The pair are to meet President Michael D Higgins and, virtually, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar among other engagements, before they spend a third day in Belfast.They will be joined by 15 businesses and former Ireland and Manchester United footballer Denis Irwin, who will act as ambassador during the visit.Central Statistics Office figures show that Ireland’s imports from Britain fell by 13 per cent in 2021 – the first year of new checks on British goods post-Brexit – compared to 2020.‘Most important trading partner’Mr Burnham said that before the pandemic, Ireland was “up there with Germany” as Manchester’s “most important trading partner” in the EU. He said he wants to keep that tradition going, and pointed to new opportunities in the tech sector. Mr Rotheram highlighted the “green industrial revolution” and offshore wind power as an area of potential collaboration.There will also be a meeting with the mayors of Dublin and Belfast to sign a memorandum on co-operation in harnessing green energy from the Irish Sea.Both politicians are directly elected mayors whose visit to Ireland comes ahead of a Citizens’ Assembly that will soon be debating the merits of bringing in a directly elected mayor for Dublin.There are already plans for Limerick to have a directly elected mayor after the people there voted in favour of the idea in 2019.Mr Burnham said having directly elected mayors in Manchester and Liverpool had given both cities a “louder voice” than they previously had in a “very London-centric country”.He has powers in the areas of transport and housing but wants more control over both areas. According to Mr Burnham the UK was late to having directly elected mayors, but that Ireland is “probably an outlier” in not having such roles.Mr Rotheram said he would like more flexibility over how money provided by central government could be spent in the Liverpool region.Having a directly elected mayor, he added, allows a city to “get a bigger bang for our buck” as they can be more “responsive” and “nimble” than what “a national monolith, a great big machine, can do on our behalf”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and

has grown to be considered among the most quintessential of pub food.But although the devilishly simple combination of bread, cheese and onion has helped the ploughman’s lunch survive the generations, it is now, finally, being forced to adapt in the modern world.And so it is that the traditional dish has been given a rebranding to make it more befitting of a gender-neutral age, at a pub in the Dartmoor village of Belstone, Devon, much to the bemusement of some social media users.The Tors pub now offers what it has described on its menu as the “ploughperson’s” lunch, for a mere £12.50.It still contains all the ingredients associated with the conventional ploughman’s lunch – cheese, ham, pickled onions, chutney and sourdough bread – suggesting nothing was thought to be wrong with the original dish itself.Instead, it appears that a name that can be traced back as far as 1837 – when John Gibson Lockhart referred to “a lunch for a ploughman” in Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott – has been identified as a pitfall that could lead to the dish being cancelled, prompting it to be changed forthwith.A picture of the pub’s menu, complete with the new name of the dish, was posted on social media by Charlotte Deakins, 36, who tweeted: Her picture quickly went viral as members of the public shared her despair that one of Britain’s best-loved meals appeared to be falling victim to cancel culture.Ms Deakins even posted a link to the menu on the pub’s website, in case anyone did not believe that the picture was genuine.On Sunday night, she told The : “Quite frankly, my reaction is that it is pandering and dangerous, unless the pub owners have done it in a tongue-in-cheek manner and I hope they have.“The tweet has gained some traction and people are absolutely sick of the nonsense and having to pussyfoot around because of a small minority who are eternally offended.”The backlash soon appeared to be spreading to the online reviews of the pub, where a one-star review was posted on Sunday by one inidual.Dicky Harrison, the landlord of The Tors pub, said on Sunday that he had been startled to see how much attention the renamed dish had received.He told The : “The menu item was just meant as a bit of tongue in cheek. We live in a farming community with amazing women and men farming the land. It’s just a bit of fun and a nod to the amazing ladies who work the land here. I didn’t think it would cause offence, but in reality, women plough too!”The ploughman’s lunch joins an ever-growing list of dishes and products that have been forced to change their names after criticism.Last June, Waitrose announced it was relabelling its own-brand Kaffir lime leaves following complaints from customers that it was racist.The word “kaffir”, which is also a slur used to describe black African people in South Africa, was removed from the ingredient’s packaging and replaced with “makrut”.Similarly, Marks \u0026amp Spencer was forced to change the name of the canned version of the pornstar martini cocktail, after feminist campaigners complained it was “normalising porn”. It is now sold as the Passion Star Martini.The retailer had to make another rebrand earlier this year after it was deemed that Midget Gems, its popular variety of sweets, might offend people with dwarfism.Marks \u0026amp Spencer changed the name of the fruit gums to Mini Gems, following a campaign launched by Dr Erin Pritchard of Liverpool Hope University, who has achondroplasia, a form of short-limbed dwarfism.Dr Pritchard said in a newspaper interview at the time: “I’m grateful that M\u0026ampS has been willing to listen to the concerns of people with dwarfism and has gone ahead with the rebranding.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: No 10\u0026#39s energy independence plan delayed again \u0026#39as Rishi Sunak resists new spending commitments\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine latest news: Fate of Mariupol in \u0026#39hands of occupiers\u0026#39, says mayorNicola Sturgeon insists ‘normal processes’ followed in awarding of controversial ferries contractThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act remains a stand-out example of how not to governKeir Starmer refuses to answer whether a woman can have a penis in latest Labour confusion over trans debateLaura Kuenssberg to take over Andrew Marr’s Sunday morning BBC politics showMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron reveals mother has dementia calls government fund","story":"David Cameron has called on the Government to help fund a “statin for the brain” after revealing his mother has dementia.The former Prime Minister, who has been president of Alzheimer’s Research UK since 2017, said pharmaceutical companies are not going to be able to “crack it on their own”.He also suggested ministers should apply the lessons learnt from the success of the vaccine task force, led by Kate Bingham, when tackling dementia.He made the comments following the diagnosis of his 87-year-old mother, Mary Cameron.“What I try to get in people’s minds is the idea that we need a statin for the brain,” he told the Sunday Times.“That humble little pill that many of us take once a day is a treatment that has had a massive effect on the incidence of heart disease because it stops the build-up of cholesterol.“That’s what we want: a drug that can help prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s and the other diseases that cause dementia.”He said that governments, universities and research institutions need to all come together to tackle the condition, which he predicts will be the leading cause of death “after Covid fades”.In the wide-ranging interview, which also touched on the Greensill scandal last spring, where Mr Cameron exploited private contacts with former government colleagues on behalf of the financier Lex Greenhill, he said his mother is a “great believer in getting on, with a stiff upper lip”.“She is doing OK. I took her to the pub the other day. But you know, not only is it a terrible disease in its later stages, but of course in the early stages it’s immensely frustrating when you can’t remember things and you worry about being forgetful.“It’s a cause of stress and depression as well as being a terrible thing in itself. So seeing it first-hand, it teaches you a lot about the very human side.”He said she is being well supported by his brother, Alexander Cameron QC, and two sisters, Tania Rachel Cameron and Clare Louise Cameron who live nearby.Their mother Mary Cameron had served as a magistrate in Newbury for more than 30 years and in 2017 won an award for campaigning against the closure of a children\u0027s centre hit by cuts David Cameron had brought in.As prime minister, Mr Cameron promised to double dementia research funding. In fact it nearly quadrupled, from £27 million in 2009-10 to £98 million in 2015-16.Boris Johnson in his 2019 election manifesto, pledged to double funding again to £160 million, in what he called a “dementia moonshot”.However, latest figures show the annual budget for the next five years is £75 million and it must be shared with research for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Fate of Mariupol in \u0026#39hands of occupiers\u0026#39, says mayorPolitics latest news: No 10\u0026#39s energy independence plan delayed again \u0026#39as Rishi Sunak resists new spending commitments\u0026#39Nicola Sturgeon insists ‘normal processes’ followed in awarding of controversial ferries contractThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act remains a stand-out example of how not to governKeir Starmer refuses to answer whether a woman can have a penis in latest Labour confusion over trans debateLaura Kuenssberg to take over Andrew Marr’s Sunday morning BBC politics showMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"globalisation has run sorry course must find new model","story":"For globalisation – the treaties, processes and structures that have made the world more complex, inter-connected and inter-reliant – is the product of political choices. Those choices, such as the regulation and deregulation of labour markets, the regulation and taxation of capital, and the terms on which countries traded with one another, determined not only that globalisation proceeded apace, but the nature of change it brought.For a while, all seemed fine. We imported cheap clothes and manufactured goods. Our borrowing costs and inflation were kept down by government policies and savers in Asia. House prices rose and plenty felt better off for it.Even now our leaders are reluctant to see the truth. They cling to long-disproved liberal assumptions – that our values are universal, that the rest of the world wants to become like us, that interconnectedness makes war impossible, that the liberalisation of trade inevitably leads to open societies and democratic politics – and hope that events might still swing their way.The longer this foolhardy hope goes on, the more painful the inevitable change will be, and the more our rivals and enemies will conspire to inflict new blows upon us. Russia, so long as it is led by Putin or his allies, cannot expect a return to normal diplomatic or economic relations. And like it or not, Western countries will soon be forced to decouple, perhaps to varying extents, from China.But if this phase of globalisation is over, what comes next? To answer we first need to be honest with ourselves. We do not, as we often tell ourselves we do, live in a liberal, rules-based order. Since the Cold War we have lived in an American-led order, in which US military and financial might has allowed Washington to dominate the world. American hegemony is preferable to anything that might replace it, but we should not delude ourselves that global institutions and structures are in any way fair. They are backed by force, and the rules are bent to protect American interests.That US-led order has not been destroyed, but it is challenged. America lost its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Through naivety and neglect, it invited China into the global trading system and watched as Beijing broke all the rules, dumped cheap products on the West, pilfered economic and military secrets, and caused deindustrialisation and social decay across the Rust Belt. American political instability, repeated elsewhere in the West, is directly linked to the economic and social anxiety fuelled in part by globalisation.The rivals and enemies who challenge us do not seek to export their ideology, overthrow our system of government, or destroy our culture. But as China becomes more powerful, its global interests are growing and with them its security and military interests grow too. As Western relative power declines, the likes of Russia, Iran and North Korea will become more assertive.The new model, then, needs to resist and restrict our rivals and enemies. It requires recognition that economic might matters, and so the pursuit of growth is not optional. It requires us to prioritise national resilience over the notional efficiency of stretched supply chains. It requires economic nationalism, strategic planning and the maintenance of domestic production and core capabilities.It also demands closer cooperation across the West, and with allies who stand with us. We need new institutions and fora to secure such cooperation, and coordinated policies on defence and security, access to commodities like energy, and vital tech capabilities, from the manufacture of chips to expertise in sectors like artificial intelligence and telecommunications. We need to be prepared for the end of the open, global internet and a challenge to the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.We will need to accept the reality of spheres of influence and, engage in a contest for support, power, trade and access to natural resources in non-aligned countries. We will need to accept we cannot help liberals and democrats in every country, and sometimes ally ourselves with countries that are neither liberal nor democratic. We will need to spend more on defence and security policy and use our combined aid budgets to rival China’s belt and road initiative. At home, we will need to do more to heal the social and economic ides our enemies like to exploit.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Fate of Mariupol in \u0026#39hands of occupiers\u0026#39, says mayorPolitics latest news: No 10\u0026#39s energy independence plan delayed again \u0026#39as Rishi Sunak resists new spending commitments\u0026#39Nicola Sturgeon insists ‘normal processes’ followed in awarding of controversial ferries contractThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act remains a stand-out example of how not to governKeir Starmer refuses to answer whether a woman can have a penis in latest Labour confusion over trans debateLaura Kuenssberg to take over Andrew Marr’s Sunday morning BBC politics showMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"progressive america slowly dying","story":"America is on the move. A rapid demographic change is underway, reshaping the nation’s economic, political and cultural contours. For as long as anyone can remember, America’s big business clusters were in the northeast, the midwest and California. New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles were the kinds of places where enterprising young Americans would go to make their way in the world.Not anymore. In just twelve months between July 2020 and July 2021, these four cities lost over 700,000 people. A very different phenomenon is playing out in conservative states, especially in the south. Almost 80 per cent of the population growth in 2021 happened in a mere ten counties. Five of the fastest growing counties were in Texas and two in Florida. The fastest of all was Maricopa county in Arizona, which is rapidly filling up with large numbers of Californian emigres.What do the growth states have in common? They favour freedom. From snow-capped Utah to swampy Florida, geography and climate are not the decisive factor state politics is. As free states thrive, radical progressives drive businesses away from their traditional hubs. Last year, Elon Musk moved Tesla\u0027s corporate HQ from California to Texas. Thousands of lower-profile businesses have made the same move. Whereas California has managed to combine European level taxation with third world level public service, free states like Texas, Tennessee and Florida do not have a state income tax at all. While in New York and Silicon Valley, permits are needed to do almost anything, states like Arizona and Utah have imposed radical red tape reduction plans.Contemporary America remains bitterly ided between these two tribes. Conservative America drives pick-up trucks, prefers its taxes low and its government small. Here the Oath of Allegiance is pledged daily, and American exceptionalism accepted as self-evident. Progressive America, on the other hand, drives a Prius rather than a pick-up and is far more likely to worry about climate change. This tribe has a fundamentally different conception of what America is, was and ought to be, and prefers to focus on intersectional identity above any kind of exceptionalism.Opinion formers in Britain, citing Biden’s win over Trump, often assume that America is moving inexorably towards a more progressive future. Yet a rather different picture is emerging.States aren’t just depopulating due to an exodus of enterprising people. Progressive America is literally dying deaths in Democrat cities and states have started to exceed births. Though birth rates have fallen across the board in the past decade, it has been most pronounced in places where folk have gone woke, perhaps losing interest in raising a family in the process. Women in conservative America on average marry significantly younger than they do in progressive states.As Chicagoans and Californians flood into Texas, Arizona and Tennessee in search of a better life, many conservatives fear that they will bring their progressive voting habits with them. A more optimistic scenario is that as the most entrepreneurial abandon progressive controlled areas in favour of free ones, they will merely reinforce the intensely inidualistic mindset that already exists there.What is certain is that two models of American identity are engaged in a fierce battle at a federal level. Because the US system allows interstate competition, here in Mississippi we are leading a campaign to abolish the state income tax. We  have written a new law on universal occupational licensing to make it easier for outsiders to come and work here.What if this kind of localism were normal in Britain? What sort of innovation could be unleashed? You would not have to kill time hoping for Boris Johnson to fix things any more than we are waiting on Joe Biden.Douglas Carswell is the President \u0026amp CEO of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Fate of Mariupol in \u0026#39hands of occupiers\u0026#39, says mayorPolitics latest news: No 10\u0026#39s energy independence plan delayed again \u0026#39as Rishi Sunak resists new spending commitments\u0026#39Nicola Sturgeon insists ‘normal processes’ followed in awarding of controversial ferries contractThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act remains a stand-out example of how not to governKeir Starmer refuses to answer whether a woman can have a penis in latest Labour confusion over trans debateLaura Kuenssberg to take over Andrew Marr’s Sunday morning BBC politics showMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sas commander accepted argentinas surrender falklands","story":"It was a foul evening, dark and bitterly cold, when Lieutenant Colonel Michael Rose first heard rumour a helicopter had gone down in the South Atlantic off the Falkland Islands.The then 42-year-old was aboard HMS Fearless, the command ship directing the British war in the Falklands, with Rose the commanding officer for all SAS operations. Despite the lack of information, Rose instinctively knew his men were on board. “I knew in my heart of hearts it was ours,” he recalls.About an hour later, Rose was stopped in a passageway on the ship by Julian Thompson, the commanding officer of 3 Commando Brigade, who broke the news that the Sea King helicopter that had gone down while transporting troops and equipment between two Navy ships was carrying members of two separate SAS squadrons.Ultimately, more than 20 troops were killed in the crash on May 19, 1982 – the worst single loss of life in the history of the elite regiment since its formation during the Second World War. The men either died on impact or drowned in the freezing ocean. Just nine survived.“He later said it was the only time he had seen me fall silent,” Rose recalls. “One’s heart just stops.”Back in Britain, an operation clicked into gear to send a military representative to tell all the families of the killed troops at precisely the same time, to prevent word leaking out first. The final widow was tracked down to a supermarket in Newcastle, where the awful news was delivered.The following evening, Rose gathered the survivors from both SAS squadrons below deck on HMS Intrepid to make the hardest speech of his life. Even more so given the rattle of anti-aircraft fire and explosions as the Argentinians launched aerial attacks on the British fleet.Six weeks after the invasion had started, the Falklands War was at a critical juncture, and Rose told his troops now was not the time to grieve.“The SAS was already deployed,” he says, “and we had been there since three weeks before the main landings and were scattered all over the place. You can’t stop at that point. The war just went on.”Rose has never previously given a newspaper interview about his role during the Falklands, and as Britain prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of the conflict, he insists he is only doing so because he is not bound by the normal code of silence the SAS usually applies to its operations. He says after the loss of the Sea King helicopter in 1982, the Ministry of Defence took the decision to break with established protocols and “tell the world what the SAS had been achieving to justify that terrible loss”.He is giving the interview ahead of a new documentary into the Falklands campaign which airs on Channel 4 tonight and features Rose alongside other senior commanders. In reflecting on the campaign in the documentary he is especially critical over the decision-making which led to the Argentine bombing of the Navy ships Sir Tristram and Sir Galahad (the deadliest day of the war). Rose describes the subsequent board of inquiry into the tragedy as a complete whitewash and claims the defence that the ships were deployed because of the need to open up a southern flank are untrue. He is also critical of some of the decision-making at Northwood headquarters which directed operations from the UK. We very nearly lost the war because of some extraordinary bad decisions that were taken by Northwood with regards to the land battle, he says.At 82 years old, Sir Michael Rose, who retired from the military in 1997 as a General, still looks every inch the Special Forces soldier. He sits ramrod straight, despite having recently broken a rib falling off a ladder, and regularly thumps the table in front of him for emphasis. We meet in a pub close to his home in Herefordshire – SAS country, where the regiment trains and where he still bumps into old comrades on country yomps who greet him with “Hello, boss”. “They are a very active bunch,” he reports of his fellow SAS retirees.His command of the elite unit gave him a ringside seat to the key geopolitical moments of the 1980s and 1990s. Rose was in a command room two doors down from the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 when the SAS stormed the building, in front of the world’s media, to kill the gunmen who had taken 26 people hostage.His position also afforded him unique access to then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Rose recalls her visiting Northern Ireland in August 1979, just a few months after she became PM, following the Warrenpoint ambush (the deadliest attack on British troops during the Troubles).A month or so after the success of the Iranian Embassy siege, Thatcher flew by helicopter to visit SAS barracks in Herefordshire, and he engineered an hour-long private meeting. Afterwards, his wife, Angela, and two young children were invited by the prime minister for tea at 10 Downing Street.The history of the SAS in the Falklands is not without controversy. Infamously, the regiment was involved in the botched Operation Mikado, a failed attempt to attack an Argentinian air base. Rose agrees it was “an utter disaster”, but insists he played no part in the operation as it was run separately from his chain of command.Similarly, an early assault on South Georgia involving the SAS failed due to appalling weather conditions, which resulted in the loss of two helicopters.But, as Rose is quick to point out, SAS troops were also involved in pivotal moments of the conflict. Most famous is the combined assault on Pebble Island, a daring raid that destroyed around a dozen Argentine aircraft.For Rose, the most important role the SAS provided was the “critical intelligence on which land battle was based”. One of his commandos, he says, spent 28 days hiding out on Mount Kent in wind, rain and snow, with just one resupply, to wire back constant updates of the enemy position.Key to their success were state-of-the-art portable satellite communication systems that Rose had personally borrowed from a contact in the US Special Forces. At the time, the only British Army satellite communication system was so large, it required a Land Rover to carry it.Aside from commanding and equipping his men, Rose also personally played a unique role in the conflict – by being the man to negotiate the Argentine surrender.He established a line of communications with the enemy through a captured Argentine air commodore, and secured an agreement to meet the military governor of the island, Mario Menendez, in Port Stanley.After a tense four hours of late-night negotiations with the governor, who Rose recalls as immaculately dressed in white gloves and an utterly “useless inidual”, the surrender was agreed. The following morning, he hoisted a Union flag borrowed from one of his SAS Squadrons as the first to fly over Port Stanley.“Punching the air is for football matches,” he says of the victory. “At the end of a war like that, you just feel very tired and relieved.”Certainly, the Falklands was not to be his last conflict. Later, he commanded UN forces during the war in Bosnia. And, in a bleak retelling of history, he notes the same tactics employed by the former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic during the siege of Sarajevo as are now being used by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. “They are shelling cities almost as a fall-back position, but it is not going to win them the war,” he says.Putin, he believes, is “completely deranged”, but warns against Nato provocation by installing a no-fly zone or troops in Ukraine: “He needs to be very carefully handled.”In preparation of the 40th anniversary of the Falklands, Rose started unpacking some of the old boxes in his home. Among the various mementos was a box of tape recordings of the peace negotiations which had been taken from his satellite phone. He dug out an old tape recorder and listened to them all. “At one point, I can hear myself saying: ‘He’s agreed to surrender everything. The war is over,’” he says. “When I heard that again, the hairs came up on the back of my neck.”Even 40 years on, Rose is still coming to terms with its legacy. On Remembrance Sunday, he often visits the SAS memorial at the regiment’s headquarters in Hereford to honour those who died under his command. “It was something that could never have been avoided, but you just think of all the good guys you lost,” he says. “As simple as that.”Falklands War: The Untold Story is on Channel 4 tonight, 10pmMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Fate of Mariupol in \u0026#39hands of occupiers\u0026#39, says mayorPolitics latest news: No 10\u0026#39s energy independence plan delayed again \u0026#39as Rishi Sunak resists new spending commitments\u0026#39Nicola Sturgeon insists ‘normal processes’ followed in awarding of controversial ferries contractThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act remains a stand-out example of how not to governKeir Starmer refuses to answer whether a woman can have a penis in latest Labour confusion over trans debateLaura Kuenssberg to take over Andrew Marr’s Sunday morning BBC politics showMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fixed term parliaments act remains stand out example not govern","story":"The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act has finally been repealed and we should all rejoice.It was always a silly constitutional oddity, imposed by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. Fixed periods between elections has always been one of those reforms that certain people on the Left tend to get very excited about, as if the very fact of change will somehow equate to an improvement. This mindset itself is based on a fundamentally cynical and self-loathing approach to all British institutions, where the status quo equates to bad, and change equates to good.True, the ability of a prime minister to choose a polling day of his or her choice, to manipulate events in order to hand his own party the greatest possible political advantage for a particular date in the calendar, is an undoubted electoral bonus. The answer to this, if you happen to be in opposition, is to win the next election so that next time round, you have that same advantage.But such a solution does not endear itself to the “progressives”, to the “modernisers”, to the kind of people who yearn for a codified constitution without all that silly British flexibility and pragmatism needed to make the current, uncodified version, work effectively. Any “solution” (and in this case, the solution was proposed before it was decided what the problem actually was) had to be written in statute and given the force of law.Oddly, David Cameron and Nick Clegg decided that the four years fixed term that had been championed by the Liberal Democrats for many years was itself flawed: surely five years would give the added advantage of keeping the newly-formed coalition in power for an extra year? The law of unforeseen consequences then took effect. Devolved elections having taken place in Scotland and Wales in May 2011, the next polling day for those two august bodies would coincide with the day of the 2015 general elections. This was an outrageous imposition on easily-confused voters, it was claimed. How could a Glaswegian seriously contemplate the task of voting for both his MP and his MSP at the same time? Was such a feat even possible?“Yes” was the obvious answer, which was never offered. In the United States, for example, early November in any even-numbered year gives American citizens an opportunity to vote for their member of the House of Representatives, their local state legislature, any number of locally-elected officials from dog-catcher to school board members, and very often their state governor, US senator and, every fourth year, the president. In some states they’re also invited to pass judgment on various other local issues via referendum. How on earth do they manage?Nevertheless, the Scottish establishment got together and came up with a great new plan to protect Scots (and the Welsh) from the perplexing and ultimately insurmountable challenge of voting for two people at once, by proposing that the Holyrood (and Assembly) elections should be postponed a year. And to avoid the same cataclysmic occurrence happening again in 2020 – when Holyrood and the Commons would, according to the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, be up for election again – they extended the devolved legislatures’ terms by a year. Permanently.One alternative would have been to schedule the devolved parliaments’ polling day in early autumn, in order to keep them separate from the UK parliament’s day of election. But this seems not to have been seriously considered.So instead we had an increase of 25 per cent on the term that everyone thought they were electing their MSPs to in 2011. And the change was made without even a hint of democratic approval. That’s an extra year’s salary for MSPs as well as an extra year for ministers to work their “magic” on Scotland’s economy (and, as it turned out, shipbuilding industry).Not only that, but if Holyrood was going to have its term extended by a year, local councils would have to get the same treatment, since bitter and hard experience had already shown that electing councillors and MSPs on the same day was a task beyond the very finest of minds.So the question arises: now that the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, the piece of unnecessary legislation that caused all this nonsense in the first place, is no longer with us, will Holyrood and Cardiff now return to the spirit and the wording of the original Acts that set them up, and resort to four-year terms?I think we all know the answer to that one, don’t we?More from NewsPolitics latest news: No 10\u0026#39s energy independence plan delayed again \u0026#39as Rishi Sunak resists new spending commitments\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine latest news: Fate of Mariupol in \u0026#39hands of occupiers\u0026#39, says mayorNicola Sturgeon insists ‘normal processes’ followed in awarding of controversial ferries contractKeir Starmer refuses to answer whether a woman can have a penis in latest Labour confusion over trans debateLaura Kuenssberg to take over Andrew Marr’s Sunday morning BBC politics showThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"laura kuenssberg replace andrew marr bbcs sunday morning politics","story":"Laura Kuenssberg will take over as the permanent presenter of the BBC’s Sunday morning politics show from September, the broadcaster has said.In December, Kuenssberg announced that she was stepping down as the corporation’s political editor after seven years.She will start her role when the show relaunches in September with a new set, title, format and title music.Sophie Raworth has been presenting the show, currently titled Sunday Morning, since Andrew Marr’s departure at the end of last year, and will continue until it goes off air for the summer parliamentary recess.Kuenssberg said: “I couldn’t be more delighted.

This is what keeps me awake at night. But he was accused of failing to get the basics right with the new plans, which critics said lacked ambition - and funding - to deliver for children. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said parents would be surprised to hear that a focus on helping every child develop good reading, writing and maths skills is a new discovery for the Education Secretary.  Ministers have also been accused of failing to address the educational disadvantage gap between rich and poor students - which has been heightened by repeated Covid lockdowns. Government-commissioned research from the Education Policy Institute, published today, found secondary pupils fell further behind over the autumn school term, with some now . months behind their expected reading level. Primary pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were . months behind their wealthier peers in reading, while the gap rose to . months for secondary pupils. Hereaposs what you need to know. Longer school weeksSchools will be told to offer at least . hours per week by September  - the equivalent of .am to .pm each day.Teachers are able to decide how the day is structured, so this could be extra time for English and Maths or sport and art activities. Mr Zahawi said he wanted to address the discrepancy of time spent in school, adding: It is unfair that a child who receives  minutes per day less of teaching time loses out on around  weeks of schooling a year.  The white paper says schools will be encouraged to go beyond the .-hour targetpossible. They will also be told to publish their hours online. But ministers were accused of missing the point by setting a target that most schools hit anyway. Former catch-up tsar Kevan Collins estimated around , schools were below the .-hour mark. There will also be no extra funding for schools to cover the longer hours. It wonapost apply to specialist schools and it is not a statutory requirement. Parents told when children falling behind The white paper includes Parent Pledge to provide extra support for pupils falling behind in class on reading, writing and maths. Parents will be told when their children need help to catch up and extra support will be given to these kids through tutoring.  But Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, descried the idea as a gimmick and said schools already had systems to help pupils. The union boss warned the idea might create expectations of on-demand support which would be dficult for schools to meet. Parents are usually already told how their children are doing through parents evenings and other channels. Boosting targets for Maths and English Higher targets for English and Maths will be introduced as part of efforts to boost standards following the pandemic. By , % of children leaving primary school to reach the expected standard in reading, writing and maths – up from the % who did in . At GCSE level, the government wants the national mean average of all grades to rise from . to  - a strong pass between the former B and C grades.  But critics have said the plan had little detail on how this would be achieved - and warned the document failed to provide a plan to close the growing disadvantage gap. NEU chief Dr Mary Bousted said: Expecting % of -year-olds to meet an arbitrary ‘expected standard’ in Maths and English at Key Stage  without giving any indication of the support that will be needed to achieve this target will immediately raise the temperature in the educational hothouse that schools have become. All schools to be inspected by Ofsted by  All schools will be inspected before pupils head off for their summer holidays in , the Government has said. Schools watchdog Ofsted had received £million to speed up its school visits so education chiefs can understand how well schools are recovering from the pandemic. Outstanding schools will be inspected for the first time this term. They were previously exempt.  Mr Zahawi believes the inspects will give parents an “up-to-date picture” and swter recognition of the hard work of leaders and teachers. The proportion of schools rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted has increased by  percentage points, from % in  to % in  Councils can set up academy trusts Plans are being redrawn to allow councils to establish their own academy trusts and ask their schools to join them by . Schools will be able to join existing academy groups or councils will be able to set them uparea lacks high-performing multi-academy trusts. Academies are state-funded schools but they are independent from local authorities, which gives them power over their curriculum, resources and governance. The last schools white paper in  set out an ambition to turn all schools into academies by  but this was dropped after a backlash.  New national register to stop pupils falling through the cracks The Government aims to change how pupil attendance is recorded after concerns over “ghost children” who failed to come back to class after lockdowns. Some experts estimate that as many as , pupils who have gone missing from school rolls during the pandemic.New laws would be introduced to modernise how attendance is recorded, with a national data solution used to track attendance and provide a safety net for vulnerable pupils at risk of disappearing from school rolls.Last year, former Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield said between , and , kids did notto school last September. “These are kids whowe don’t get them back to school will have diminished le chances and job opportunities,” she said.

Universal free lateral flow tests will end on Friday. People aged  and over will still be able to get them, alongside those with compromised immune systems –they have symptoms.That would mean a family of four visiting someone once a week would fork out almost £ a week, or £, per year. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who was a carer for his mum and now cares for his son, slammed the Tories’ “reckless” move.  He said: “With rates of Covid rising and many concerned they may pass this virus to their vulnerable loved ones, the Government’s decision to scrap free Covid tests is reckless. “Not only will this put people at risk, it will also hit families in the pocket just as taxes are being hiked and energy bills are skyrocketing. “The end to free testing is a tax on those who visit loved ones in care homes – it is a tax on caring. “Instead of helping families that are struggling to get by, Boris Johnson is scrapping free testing in a short-sighted move that will increase the cost of day-to-day le for millions of people.The Chancellor must execute a U-turn on his behalf.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

At Sundayaposs ceremony, Rock quipped, Jada, canapost wait for G.I. Jane , in reference to  film G.I Jane - which starred Demi Moore sporting a buzzcut similar to Pinkett Smith. Smith walked onto the stage and slapped the presenter, before ing to his seat and shouting: Keep my weaposs name out of your f****** mouth. Pinkett Smith has previously spoken about deciding to shave her head as she suffers from alopecia, which causes hair loss.  Smith, who later won the Best Actor award, used his acceptance speech to give a tearful apology to the Academy and all my fellow nominees - but not Rock. Mr Hoare, who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland Committee, tweeted: Re Will Smith incident @theoscarslive I’d just hopesomeone thought it in good taste to make a joke at the expense of a medical condition of my we then I’d get up and lamp him. The *joke* was tasteless.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said Rock was mistaken to make the joke but violence is never the answer.He told LBC: Violence is never the answer to any problem-solving, as Will Smith admitted himself in that tearful, heart-wrenching apology. I think we should also remember - and Iaposm the Education Secretary - that actually sometimes even a joke can be below the belt. When a joke is about somebodyaposs we and her illness - she has alopecia - it is wrong. I think Chris Rock was mistaken to do that to Mrs Smith.  He added: I have to say, a first Oscar for one of my favourite actors was wonderful to see - marred by that incident, sadly. Asked how he would explain the incident to childrenhe was a teacher, he told BBC Breakfast: I would say, donapost do it. You could see Will Smith - and my heart was broken when I saw him, that tearful apology, he apologised immediately. It was hard for him because it was someone who made a joke about his we and her illness. Thataposs not easy but he regretted it and he apologised immediately. It is heart-breaking when you lose control of your emotions in that way, but I think it is important not to allow yourself to cross that line, and he apologised immediately, which is good to see. Labour leader Keir Starmer said he was pretty shocked by the incident. He told LBC: Anybody who insults family members excites something quite emotional in all of us. But on the other hand, to go up and hit someone in that way is wrong, Iaposm afraid. It was the wrong thing to do. Mr Starmer said he was struck by the fact that it didnapost appear to be completely spontaneous - saying Smith appeared to absorb the comments calmly and then reacted. Iaposm sorry, for me thataposs the wrong side of the line, he added.Smith wonapost face charges over the incident as Rock declined to file a police report.A spokesperson for Los Angeles Police said it is aware of an incident between two iniduals during the Academy Awards programme [which] involved one inidual slapping another.

But before long, the -year-old says her suitoraposs love pitch seemed to escalate and he suggested the pair get married and spend Thanksgiving together - just a few weeks after they first began chatting. She said: At that point I knew it was some sort of scam. We barely knew each other. I just blocked him.

When the pair had still been chatting on Instagram, Nicole had sent Marcus a photo of herself on the beach. Now, he was threatening to photoshop the image into a nude photo, which he would make publicshe didnapost send him money. Nicole claimed he even threatened to harm her childrenshe didnapost give over £,- but she stood firm and refused to comply with his demands.  Although she bravely stood her ground, Nicole was shaken by the incident - and when she saw a photo of Marcus a few months later, she felt startled. However, this time the photo was attached to an account by the name Alessandro Cinquini - who was the real person behind the handsome photo. Nicole said the fact Alessandro had a lot of followers and shared details about his le proved to her this was the real deal - so she decided to reach out to him. To her surprise, he only lived an hour away from her in Miami - and he was well aware scammers were using his photos to take advantage of women. Whereas at first he tried to take action against people using his identity, he has now given up trying. Nicole said: He has hundreds of fake profiles attached to his name. Itaposs crazy. After connecting online, the pair decided to meet in person in January - and they hit it off immediately. They are now officially dating. Nicole said she was wary of getting involved with Alessandro at first, given what happened the first time she got involved with the person she thought was him. But now she says her new love is amazing and sheaposs really excited to see what the future brings. However, there are issues with dating a man whose photo is used so frequently by scammers. Nicole said: He’s been out to dinner and had an angry woman come up to him. They complain that he ghosted them, maybe some of them actually paid money to a scammer because of his profile.

Lance Corporal Oliver Nelson, , struck the  year oldaposs buttocks with apossome forceapos and laughed out loud, leaving her feeling aposuncomfortable,apos a court martial heard. LCpl Nelson was a drill instructor with the  year old Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which is known for its iconic tunics and plumed helmets being at the heart of the Queenaposs birthday parade, royal weddings and state occasions. The regiment only began accepting women in  and Judge Jane England said unwanted, disrespectful behaviour like LCpl Nelsonaposs could discourage more young women from joining the Army.He claimed he was simply aposjoining inapos as some young recruits were slapping each otheraposs bottoms after a night out in central London.  LCpl Nelson also twice breached strict rules on the conduct of instructors by having alcoholic drinks with trainees - some of whom were under . At Bulford Military Court, Wilts, LCpl Nelson was dismissed from the Army. The court heard that on the way back to Hyde Park Barracks, which is just three quarters of a mile from Buckingham Palace, the teenager had been in front of LCpl Nelson on an escalator in Knightsbridge tube station. Prosecuting, Colonel Grant Davies said: The woman was ahead of Nelson and she felt a slap to her buttocks which she described was with some force. She turned around and saw LCpl Nelson laughing. The woman describes feeling really uncomfortable that he had done that at all. She felt so uncomfortable after the incident that when she found out LCpl Nelson was staying near to where she was, she felt she had to stay in a room with two other trainees.  Later on in the same evening, LCpl Nelson bought alcoholic drinks for the teenagers which goes against barracks rules on instructors socialising and drinking with the trainees. Colonel Davies added: They ed to barracks on the same evening. The woman and other trainees within the training ward were joined by LCpl Nelson who purchased alcohol to be consumed by trainees. LCpl Nelson was there and consumed alcohol in contravention of the standing orders.He again bought cider and spirits including vodka within a week or so of the first incident and took it to a trooperaposs room to drink with trainees, some of whom were under , the court heard. LCpl Nelson pleaded guilty to one count of carrying out conduct of an indecent kind and two of contravening standard orders. Dismissing LCpl Nelson from the Army, Judge Jane England said: [The female trainee] was supposed to be able to look up to you as someone she admired and respected, as someone who upheld the standards of her unit and the army as a whole. Instead, you acted in a completely disrespectful way towards her by slapping her bottom on a night out. She, as a woman, had the right to have a say in who does and does not touch her. Your regiment is one that has just opened up to females. It does mean perhaps you did not have experience dealing with females. But females should be encouraged into such roles. Subjecting young females to such unwanted behaviour is not consistent with that aim. Defending, Matthew Bolt described LCpl Nelsonaposs actions in smacking the young trainee as aposspectacularly foolishapos and added his client aposwanted to join inapos as other soldiers were slapping each other. Mr Bolt said: This was LCpl Nelsonaposs first time dealing with trainees and he became overly friendly as he wanted to be liked. This was a group of people who were friends. He interpreted the behaviour as banter, he wanted to join in but should have stepped back. He wanted to join in and it was spectacularly foolish of him to have done so. LCpl Nelson also received a two-year service community order and will have to do  hours of unpaid work in the next year.

Neither woman was aware he was dating the other until five months later when Miss Fuller became suspicious of Sweeney Facebook messaging aposwork colleagueapos Miss Muslin.She contacted care home manager Miss Muslin and the two began talking and realised they had both been conned. The pair, who were duped out of a combined £, by Sweeney, decided to report him to the police. Now firm friends, they sat in court as they watched as the aposheartless sociopathapos was sent to prison for  months after he pleaded guilty to  fraud offences.  The court heard that Sweeney, a carer, first met Miss Muslin, who is aged in her s, through work and they began a romantic relationship in March .Around the same time he also started dating Miss Fuller, an NHS worker aged in her late s who lived next door to him in Wimborne, Dorset.He asked Miss Muslin for a loan to buy a car and Miss Fuller, who he moved in with, for money to start up a business. Sweeney, , promised to pay them back but never did. He also took jewellery, which had belonged to Miss Fulleraposs late mother, and never ed it. Bournemouth Crown Court heard his actions had ruined the womenaposs lives. Miss Muslin said Sweeney took £, from her, which led to her going overdrawn and having to remortgage her house. Miss Fuller had more than  years service in the NHS, but the deception meant she had to be signed off work and struggled to cope when she did , getting several disciplinaries. She and her daughter also had to move house and she had to rely on her father to help her out with finances. Jonathan Underhill, prosecuting, said: Both were completely unaware that Mr Sweeney was in a relationship with either of them. In a remarkably short period of time he made a number of  representations in order to persuade them to give him money. He said they were short-term loans that he would repay and that he had the means to repay. The court heard that Sweeneyaposs deception came to light in September . Miss Fuller said: Although we never knew each other prior to this we did know of each other. I thought she was a work colleague and she knew I was a neighbour. He used to disappear for days, sometimes weeks at a time, allegedly aposworkingapos.On this particular day on hishis phone kept pinging when I glanced over to him Saraaposs Facebook profile bubble was on his phone.He said it was work and Sara wanted him to work a sht. I had a suspicion something wasnapost right and decided to friend request her. She said Sweeney was always charming and charismatic and had persuaded her and her father to loan him money. It was devastating to find out he was doing the exact same thing to another family. I was broken into a million pieces. He walked away with it all and left me with nothing.He probably stole in excess of £, in possessions and £, cash. He had two phones I had to carry on paying off. My credit rating is in tatters because of the debt Julio put me in. I defaulted on my phone and car payments. He is a heartless, selfish, manipulating sociopath who preys on single, hard-working parents to break them down and gets a kick out of doing so. Miss Muslin said her parents and children had both been taken in by Sweeney and she struggled to trust anyone now. She said: I was made to feel like I was going mad. He made me question myself and I was made to feel stupid. He took £, from me, I had charges for being overdrawn, high interest on credit cards, I had to remortgage my house and got a CCJ because of it. I had never been in debt before I met Julio. If he hadnapost taken my money I would not be in debt now. When interviewed, Sweeney claimed to police his relationship with Miss Muslin was sexual and she had put the money in his account so they could have a aposgood timeapos at hotels, festivals and on nights out. He said when the relationship ended she sent him a message saying she didnapost want any money back. He eventually admitted fraud against Miss Muslin of £, and £, against Miss Fuller. Edward Warren, defending, said Sweeny, originally from Trinidad, was of previous good character and had aposhis own vulnerabilitiesapos. In jailing him Recorder James Newton-Price QC said: Both of these women were unaware of the other. You cheated each of them by asking for loans which they could not really afford to give you. Both these women blame themselves but they should not. It was all your fault. I take the view that your conduct towards both women was manipulative and had a devastating effect. Sara Muslin you made her feel extremely foolish and put her into serious debt. Jane Fuller had to be signed off work on the verge of a nervous breakdown. You lack genuine remorse and victim awareness.

The then--year-old, from Greasby, Wirral, went to bed ready for his daughteraposs birthday the next day only to wake up with no idea what had happened.He remembers wolfing down a bowl of cereal prior to calling it a night only to find paramedics standing over him at around .pm, reports the Liverpool Echo. Dave had stopped breathing in his sleep. When he came round he felt groggy and was so surprised he tried to boot the medics out of his house. He recalls struggling to remember where he worked or his date of birth, when they asked him. The dad-of-two underwent surgery to remove the tennis ball-sized tumour at the Walton Centre and had to take medical retirement from his job at Merseyside Police.The following year, scans showed the tumour had ed and had become a Gliblastoma Multorme . A GMB is a fast-growing and aggressive tumour with a devastatingly short survival rate of just - months. Dave was told his diagnosis was terminal and he had six to eight months left to live with treatment or three months without. The -year-old said: I went away with a hard decision to make and slipped into one of the darkest places Iaposve ever been to. I spent about a week, two weeks, just lying on the couch.  I accepted that I was going to die and I just lay there and waited for it to happen. I just didnapost care anymore. The former world kickboxing champion, said it was his we Samantha who helped him to get out of that dark place in July  and he decided to tackle his brain tumour like a fight. He said: I just thoughtthe average is - months there must be people that go before then and there must be people who get up to  months. I thought youaposve never been average at anything, so what I did is, I kind of treated it asit was a fight. I named it Terry my opponent, and when I took on a fight say it was - months Iaposd go into a full on camp lockdown. I decided to tackle it  degrees, so by diet, exercise, forming good habits of sleep, alternative therapies, supplementation, mindfulness, mediation and then accept the treatments as well, so the gold standard. It was dual radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by full on chemotherapy. Dave continues to outlive his terminal diagnosis over seven years later and in January this year doctors told him only small signs of the disease were visible.  He has now become a motivational speaker who helps people, charities and businesses and now runs a charity called Ahead of the Game Foundation, based in Wallasey, with former Premier League footballer Dominic Matteo.He has shared his story to mark Brain Tumour Awareness Month and highlight the need for more funding for brain tumours, with historically just one per cent of the national spend on cancer research being allocated to brain tumours. Dave said: Iaposm trying to use my own horric situations to remind people that there is another way, there is another option and there is hope. I’ll never be cured. I have to live everyday knowing it could come back at any second because even though I have. While the last scan showed there was no real evidence of the disease but there are still a web of cells, creating a perfect storm for it to spark but he has decompartmentalised it, he added.If you would like to donate to Ahead of the Game Foundation click here.

Laura Bisset was the matron at the St Christopheraposs Railway Service Orphanage, also known as St Christopheraposs Railway Home, from  to  and in that time cared for thousands of children in Derby. After retiring to Wiltshire, the matron, who was known as Miss Bisset by those who were in her care, died aged  in December . In her will she left money to  charities and small bequests to several people, including almost  people who were once in her care.The executors of her will, her nephews Philip and David Lough, have tracked down all bar three of those who have been left money, Derbyshire Live reports.But the family need help finding the final three after the trail has gone cold. Philip Lough said: My aunt Laurie was a deeply philanthropic lady who devoted her le to looking after others.  We have had dozens of very moving letters and messages from former St Christopher’s girls, many still in the Derby area, who knew and loved her. So many have told us what a great influence she had been on their lives.We have used ious ways of locating them, including the excellent St Christopher’s Facebook page.We are now appealing to anyone who might know the current whereabouts of these three former St Christopher’s girls to contact us. Their names are Corina Jaffe, Sally-Ann Knight and Sheila Taylor. Corina’s last known address was in St Albans Road, Derby and Sally-Ann’s in Allenton, while Sheila is believed to have moved to Lincoln some years ago. The trail on all three has gone cold since then. The orphanage stood on the land that is now used as sports pitches at Markeaton Park, next to Ashbourne Road in the city. It was founded in  by members of the Railway Servantsapos Society after children were often left orphaned when their parents died in the course of their work, with Derby chosen as its location due to its strong connection with the railways at the time. The home originally had just  children, but after some adaptations, by the late s the new site cared for more than  children from all over the UK and Ireland. It was renamed St Christopheraposs Railway Home in , just before Miss Bisset joined as matron.

Michael OaposHareaposs Leeds city centre restaurant gets rave reviews and Yorkshire Live Reporter Lucy Marshall decided to try it out. She says she is a self-confessed fine dining admirer with a aposwide palateapos and she was therefore keen to see what all the fuss was about.Lucy said she has been to some very fancy restaurants in her time and is a big fan of a tasting menu so she can try out new flavours and be a bit more adventurous with her cuisine. She therefore thought The Man Behind the Curtain would be right up her street. She was full of excitement and ready to e in. Sheaposd only had a porridge and cups of coffee that morning so at .pm on Friday, she was ready to feast. She walked inside to a grand marble staircase and it immediately felt luxurious. This is how her experience went. When Lucy walked in, she immediately felt at home and thought this is a bit of me. This was clearly a place of luxury and the surroundings made her feel like she was a rich woman about to enjoy the most opulent fine dining experience.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Front of house were very attentive and directed Lucy to a seating area which consisted of fur throws and white sofas. She was then able to peruse the cocktail menu - something that was again right up my street. The atmosphere was calm and edgy in her words and, although she enjoyed looking at the cocktails, the prices were extravagant with the cheapest £ for a single sip. She opted for a Cosmopolitan and was taken to her table. aposI wouldn’t call that Masterchef qualityapos Lucy says she was treated like a princess during her meal. Staff looked after her, even when she politely had to turn down having something from the wine menu due to the expensive prices. As she waited for food, Lucy discovered her first snag. She expected to be given some complimentary bread and butter while she waited as the hunger kicked in. Unfortunately she was given nothing until her first course arrived with the waiter serving her a fake white egg with a black star on it. There was no explanation from staff about the ingredients of the meal so she had to tuck in by breaking the egg and finding out was inside herself.  Inside, she found a tuna tartar with a spicy sauce. It was nice and fine but didnapost overwhelm her and she was still hungry meaning the next course couldnapost come soon enough. Next to arrive was a prawn on top of an old fashioned phone. Cool, extravagant and unusual but Lucy did also wonder why it had been presented like that as she said: I wouldn’t call that MasterChef quality. A big fan of prawns, Lucy bit into them after opening the shell. Normally she is a fan of seafood but said this literally tasted like it had just swam out of the ocean and onto my plate.  It said it came with tikka, but Lucy couldnapost taste any and wasnapost impressed at having to eat the prawns with her bare hands. After that dish, a bowl of soup arrived. But, it wasnapost quite what she was expecting as she was served this cold cheese thing with ice on top. Her hunger had not waned and scallops soon arrived, which Lucy admitted is one of my favourites. It was dressed in a really nice sauce but it wasnapost as exquisite as sheaposd hoped and she was still starving. Cod in squid ink followed and she soon realised there really was a preference towards fish in the restaurant. It peeled of her fork amazingly and was beautully cooked. However, an unappetising pork dish followed.  Describing it, Lucy said: Is it just me that thinks eating food that looks like a bonfire isn’t appealing  I don’t want to eat black food that looks burnt. We want colourful vibrant food that draws me in not scares me away. It was very nice to eat but the presentation left a lot to be desired for Lucy. She was then told she would be moving onto desserts - something which surprised her given the low quantity of food she was given for her mains. A mini tiramisu was served up first before a dark chocolate. She says these took a while to arrive, leaving her agitated and the saving grace was four macaroons that came in a iety of dferent flavours. aposA Pot Noodle has more flavourapos After her experience, Lucy had some concerns. Although she thought the restaurant was quirky and unique, she just didnapost get it. She said: While the place looked beautul it was just really weird. Even the kne and forks were abnormally small. If Iaposm paying £ for a meal I want proper cleaned expensive looking silverware. As much as the interior was sexy looking and fun, and the crockery and glasses used were beautul, the most important part of a restaurant is the food and frankly I left super hungry, unhappy and unimpressed by the food. Half of the dishes I could have made in my kitchen, and I think a Pot Noodle has more flavour than some of the dishes placed in front of me. I would tell people to go for a one-off experience, but I would not recommend it for a good and delicious meal.

Eligibility criteria apply.aposWe had loads of jobs but not enough people to fill themapos  Screenprinting business Paul Bristow Associates is just one of the employers who’ve worked with Jobcentre Plus to fill vacancies. The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”aposMy team made me feel very welcome and supported meapos  “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.” Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.” aposIt’s important to personalise our serviceapos  “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people. There are also plenty of roles in the hospitality and care sectors.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Department for Work and PensionsJD SportsLee DixonJobs CentreMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"Get The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr Get your favourite newspaper free on your tablet for two months* with our special digital edition deal.Our daily download is perfectyouaposre self-isolating - or have an elderly family member or friend who canapost get out of the house.

But they were just sent on their way and told to wait for a referral letter. Bartender Chloe said doctors assured her that Esmai was perfectly healthy even though she was vacant behind her eyes. The tot was finally diagnosed with a rare and aggressive anaplastic ependymoma tumour the size of a grapefruit.  Shocking videos show baby Esmai suffering a seizure just hours after doctors dismissed her mum’s fears that she was unwell. Chloe filmed her baby going into spasm in a desperate bid to show doctors Esmai was seriously unwell. The first video was taken in Stoke Hospital on October  last year and shows the little girl appearing to go into a trance with her eyes wide open. Mum Chloe holds onto her daughteraposs hand until the seizure passes. Despite showing medics the videos, Chloe was repeatedly told Esmai was “perfectly healthy”.The next day, Esmai was filmed at home suffering a similar episode which was caused by an undiagnosed brain tumour. She was finally diagnosed with a large brain tumour and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. A CT scan revealed Esmai had a tumour the size of a grapefruit which had caused her entire brain to be pushed over to the left side of her head. She has been undergoing gruelling chemotherapy which has left her with painful ulcers and burns in her mouth which Chloe treats with ice cream on her dummy.  Chloe, of Stoke-on-Trent, said she first knew something was wrong when her little girl began staring into space in October last year. She was referred to a walk-in-centre by her local GP and Esmai was diagnosed with rigors – often known as absent seizures. The two of them were sent home but later that day Esmai suffered further seizures and an ambulance rushed them both to Royal Stoke Hospital. Chloe said: “We went through a cycle of Esmai having seizures which I would film and show to the healthcare team when we went to hospital.  Every time we saw a doctor, we had a dferent diagnosis and each time, we were told that she was perfectly healthy and to wait for the referral letter.” “I am obviously really angry that it took this long to diagnose my little girl. It is not common at her age to have seizures. One doctor went to speak to a practitioner without even seeing Esmai and said they didnapost think it was seizures. I was really mad. “They could have gone down a dferent routethey had picked it up earlier. I had to fight because I knew something was not right. “I knew my baby wasnapost well and I asked the doctorhe could do something, but he said there was nothing wrong with her. “I was angry nobody was listening to me.“My daughter is on chemotherapy now – every two weeks for a year – we have our good and bad days, but I do think this could have been avoided. The doctors said she would need at least a year of chemotherapy treatment and that the tumour is le-threatening with a survival rate of  per cent.” Esmai will continue chemotherapy until November and further treatment options of radiotherapy is available should the tumour grow.Chief Nurse Ann-Marie Riley, from University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, said: “We understand it is an extremely distressing experience for any parent when their child is unwell and we are very sorry that Ms Wright has had cause to complain about the service she and her child received here at UHNM.“It is our aim to deliver the highest standards of care possible and we are in contact with Ms Wright so we can fully investigate her concerns and resolve any issues.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBabiesHospitalsBrain Tumours\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jenner Baker, , was jailed after Kane Aitchison, , was abducted and held hostage in her property in Manchester for  hours. Kane was beaten and stripped by eight men before boiling hot water was poured over his torso and genitals, Manchester Crown Court heard.He was told he would only be released once a £, ransom had been paid but when he said he had no money he was tied to a chair and had his hands and feet bound with a jumper wrapped around his neck. The kidnappers threatened to inject the victim with heroin in a bid to aposaposturn him into a junkieaposapos before they force-fed him tablets he believed to be rat poison.They also put him in fear of being raped before locking him inside a wardrobe. Kane escaped the next morning after biting through his bindings and sneaking past a sleeping guard who was armed with a hammer. He fled the property and was later treated in hospital for burns. Police investigating the attack found Baker had allowed the property to be used infor drugs.As the victim was being tortured she was heard asking the gangthey had any narcotics to give her. At Manchester Crown Court she admitted assisting an offender and was jailed for  months. Kane was bundled into a car outside his home by two men in November  and taken to Bakeraposs house against his will. Alaric Bassano, prosecuting, said: aposaposAt this house, he was imprisoned and assaulted over a number of hours. Demands were made that unless he handed over a six-figure quantity of cash, he would be gravely injurednot killed.  aposaposHe was assaulted in the kitchen and living room. He was punched in the face, dragged around rooms downstairs, kicked, stamped on, struck with a chair and had his head struck against a wall. aposaposHe was tied to a chair in the kitchen, his hands were bound with the cord from a set of hair clippers, his feet were bound with rope and a jumper wrapped around his neck whilst his face was covered with a sheet. He continued: aposWhen Mr Aitchison did not relent, the boiling water was poured over his torso and his genitals. A sock was inserted in his mouth and fixed in place with Sellotape which caused him to struggle for his breath. He feared he was going to suffocate.  The victim was taken upstairs, tied up and locked in a wardrobe. The following morning, after  hours of imprisonment, he bit through his bindings, forced open the wardrobe door and tried to escape through the bedroom window. When that failed he ran out of the house, avoiding a hammer-wielding gaoler and sought help from passers-by. He suffered signicant injuries, including burns.aposapos Mr Bassano added: aposaposaposWhether or not Baker was herself an offender, she was being recruited or used in a way which exploited her own addiction to drugs. She was the occupant of the premises and was present whilst the underlying offence was being committed and the use of her premises was vital to the commission of that offence. aposaposBut on the other hand, she had not intended or planned for this to happen, she was being exploited by others who imposed themselves on her and she was fearful.aposapos Baker who has since moved to Bolton was initially charged with blackmail, kidnap,  imprisonment and causing grievous bodily harm with intent but her not guilty pleas to those charges were accepted. Five men are due to be sentenced later over the kidnap.  In mitigation for Bakeraposs defence, Ian Metcalfe called for his client to be jailed saying it would provide an opportunity for her to get herself clean. He added: aposaposIf this house was not available then they would have found another house in which someone  would have been preyed upon. She was targeted by others because of her obvious weaknesses and vulnerability and she was exploited by very dangerous iniduals. aposaposShe should have said aposnoapos but that was never going to be accepted and she was not up to the task to say aposnoapos in any event. She has never prospered and has had a most wretched le.aposapos  Sentencing Judge Elizabeth Nicholls said: aposaposThis group of men used your house to imprison Kane Aitchison, torture him and subject him to degrading violent treatment. It is right to note that you were to a degree as much a victim as he was. The people who came to your address undoubtedly used you as they knew you would put up no resistance when they arrived at your door. aposaposIt is not asyou invited them to your house but you simply had little choice in the matter. You had no part in the violence but of course, you were present when you heard some of the violence being inflicted.

If a person is supervising a driver who is learning, they could be hit with £, fine - as well as a massive six points on their licence. Current rules under the Highway Code make texting or calling while driving illegal. But new rules brought in on Friday means many grey areas have been tightened, making more actions illegal. In , it was ruled in the High Court that an offence was committed when a mobile was used for an interactive communication .  This included calling or texting, but now using a phone for any purpose, is seen as reckless and dangerous. Now drivers can no longer touch their device, take photos or videos, access playlists or use other apps while they drive. Phone use at traffic lights or in motorway queues will also be seen as illegal under new Highway Code rules. Anyone using a device while driving faces a £ fixed fine plus six points added to their driving licence. Motorists are, however, permitted to use their phones to pay at a drive-thru restaurant or a road or bridge toll. The Department of Transport : There will be an exemption to the new law for drivers making a contactless payment using their mobile phone while stationary to ensure the law keeps pace with technology.This exemption will cover, for example, places like a drive-through restaurant or a road toll, and will only apply when payment is being made with a card reader. It will not allow motorists to make general online payments while driving. Hands-free devices can be used when driving including taking calls or using a satnav, but onlyit is secured in something which holds it.

Four-year-old Layla was taken in by the RSPCA Sheffield Animal Centre in January  after she was rescued from a house in West Yorkshire. She was found in a neglected state with all her bones visibly protruding from her body. But now she is a picture of health, the RSPCA team want to secure her a new home as they feel her nervous nature may have put people off adopting her in the past. They are confident her lovely and playful personality will win over experienced owners and someone will be able to give her a home.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Hayley Crooks, animal lead at the branch said: Layla is our favourite girl. She is so lovely and likes to spend time with people she trusts and her fun-loving side also likes getting up to some mischief at times! She can be incredibly nervous around new people but with careful introductions and lots of tasty treats she will make friends. She loves to have lots of fun games to play and enjoys her time outside adventuring. During her time with us Layla has spent time in foster homes, where she learnt how to enjoy le in the home. However she may need slow introductions to the new home and general le outside kennels.  Layla was taken in by the branch following an RSPCA investigation. Inspector Kris Walker was sent to an address in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, following a report by a member of the public who was concerned about the welfare of the dog. He found Layla was emaciated with her spine, pelvis and hips clearly prominent and her owner agreed to sign her over into RSPCA care so could receive emergency veterinary treatment. A veterinary examination found Layla had a body score of one out of nine, with one being the lowest, which is an emaciated state. The vet estimated she had been suffering for between six and eight weeks.Kris said: I am delighted to see how Layla has been transformed in the care of RSPCA Sheffield Animal Centre.Due to her circumstances staff at the branch do have some requirements for her new home, but we just know that there is a loving owner out there for her. Layla’s new home would have to be with experienced owners who would be able to spend lots of time with her. She would need someone who is home a lot of the time to help settle her in. As Layla can be quite worried and anxious around other dogs -especially when in her space. -Ii would also have to be a home with no other pets. She walks well on the lead but she has been muzzle trained as she is nervous of other dogs when they come close to her. Hayley added: She really is so lovely and sweet and we all love her dearly and know her forever home is out there.If you can offer Layla her perfect forever home please email us over a completed application to customerservices@rspcasheffield.org.Do you have a dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

The scene was caught on camera by a passer-by and heavily-bleeped footage was shown in court. Prosecutor Ashley Petchey said three protesters were sitting across the road and queues of traffic had built up behind them.  Speid got out of her vehicle and remonstrated with the demonstrators, the court heard. A woman is seen telling the protesters they must move out of the way now and my son needs to go to school and I need to go to work. She also says: My son is  and he needs to go to school. Of the dangerous driving count, Mr Petchey said: It is not an excessive speed as the driver was using the brakes quite heavily. This is done on two occasions.  The Range Rover stops very close to the female protester. Mr Petchey said the dangerous driving meant that injury could have been caused. He said: Clearly this was an incident where there was a risk, evenno injury was caused. An assault charge against Speid, in which it was alleged that protester Bethany Mogie had been beaten, was dismissed after the prosecution said it would produce no evidence.The prosecution said it would ask for £ in costs and a pre-sentence report was ordered. Peter Hoche, chairman of the bench, unconditionally bailed Speid to next appear at Basildon Magistratesapos Court on May  for sentencing. He also banned Speid from driving by issuing her with an interim driving disqualication. At the height of the Insulate Britain road-blocking protests, Speid attempted to move the activists with her Range Rover.  “What they’re doing is wrong, she said afterwards. They’re not peaceful, they’re obstructive and they’re rude, she continued. I’m upset I lost my temper and maybe I could’ve gone about it in a dferent way but I will always stand up for what I believe in — that people should be entitled to live their normal lives. She said at the time that she was standing up for other mums who needed to take their children to school in the mornings. Insulate Britain has demanded that the government invest money in making Britainaposs homes less leaky and cold, in a bid to save energy and therefore protect the environment.

Ella Holley claims she started taking the Cerazette mini pill back in October but three days later dashed to Gloucester Royal Hospital AE as strange apostiny red spotsapos began appearing all over her legs.The -year-old said she experienced a series of aposflare-upsapos where a painful red rash extended from her feet up to her waist and slightly on her arms, having seven flare ups in under three weeks which left marks even after the rash had faded. The hotel receptionist claims when it was at its worst it caused joint pain akin to a apossprained ankleapos and her skin had the excruciating sensation of being aposset alightapos each time it was touched. She eventually saw a specialist in January and claims she was told sheaposd experienced Henoch-Schonlein purpura , a disorder where small blood vessels become inflamed, as a side effect of taking the contraceptive pill. Have you suffered a medical drama  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story  With her scarring now faded, Ella has vowed to never go near the mini pill again and is keen to raise awareness of the potential side effects that women can experience when putting contraception into their bodies. Ella, of Gloucester, Gloucestershire, said: When it first appeared I didnapost have a clue what it was. I was worried because with being at university I was like aposis it the pill thataposs doing this  Is it alcohol  Is it being out in the cold after a night out maybe apos I was just concerned about what it was. I was living the standard university student le which I would say can be quite unhealthy at times and is what I thought was causing this.  I was living with the lack of routine, poor choice of diet and the alcohol too, but no more than any other students I knew, so I didnapost understand why this only happened to me. On top of that, the next day Iaposd eat the most rubbish food. I was living a very unhealthy lestyle at the time. I thought maybe my body was trying to react to that and tell me that it had had enough or I needed to stop doing that. If something goes wrong Iaposll automatically blame myself and thought aposoh God, is it something Iaposm doing aposThe singleton said she experienced her first aposflare upapos on October th - just three days after first taking the pill - and her parents were concerned she may have measles. She rushed to AE, and after spending  hours there Ella was told by doctors that they werenapost sure what it was and referred her to a rheumatologist. She stopped taking her pill two days later. Ella said: It flared up and would get to its worst and then gradually start going down.I couldnapost really put my finger on it because it would calm down and obviously Iaposd stopped taking the pill at this point and then Iaposd go on a night out or to work for the day and it would come back in little spots. When it was at its worst I had joint pain in both ankles. It felt like Iaposd almost sprained my ankle or something. It felt like my skin had been set alight every time something touched it, especially in the shower and when I went to bed. I remember being sat on my sofa and my friend knocked my leg and it was horrically painful.Ella said her flare-ups seemed to happen after sheaposd been on her feet. Apart from her initial one the worst she experienced was after her nieceaposs wedding at the end of October, and prior to that day the markings on her skin had started to subside considerably. Ella said: It was very sore. It was a case of cold showers because the hot water felt like burning, it felt like someone had a lighter to my skin. During the first two or three days I only showered maybe once or twice because it was so painful. Something  I found very painful was when I was in bed and had my duvet rubbing against it. I had to stay so still until I fell asleep because there was no tossing or turning around.Luckily I live with a house full of girls and I used to walk around the house in pretty much a hoodie and a pair of pants because I wouldnapost want anything touching or rubbing against it. It was awful, I hated it. Trying to find things to wear for events and stuff was just, it brought me to tears multiple times. I was gutted. It was just embarrassing because when the girls were dresses to go out, I had to wear a pair of jeans that would cover down past my shoes. Luckily the university student hasnapost had any new spots appear since around th December.She claims she visited the rheumatologist on the th January and was told she had Henoch-Schonlein purpura , and that it shouldnapost reappear but thereaposs a possibility it could. Ella posted her experience online to raise awareness given prior to this year sheaposd never heard of HSP or of women having any similar reaction as a result of taking contraception. Ella said: The doctor said that it was HSP, which was a result of taking the pill. It was nice to know that it was something rather than one of those stories where thereaposs never really an answer to it and you just kind of have to live with it. So in a way I was relieved. Iaposve not taken any contraception since. Thereaposs no way Iaposd take the mini pill again, I just donapost think itaposs worth the risk, personally for me. Because thataposs happened to me, I in no way want to discourage anyone  trying it, but my bodyaposs had that reaction to it and I know thereaposs a chance it could potentially come back and I wouldnapost want to do that again - spend the next four months of my le covering up. People will always make their own final decisions but I wanted to share my experience so that people are aware, which hopefully makes them feel both more comfortable and confident in the choices they make, as I believe this is not spoken of enough. Iaposm not saying at all that this is going to happen to everyone but this is my experience, take from it or leave from it what you please. A spokesperson for Organon said: Nothing is more important to Organon than the safety of our products and the people who use them. We are confident in the research that supported the approval of Cerazetteand its use in clinical practice in multiple countries around the world since its approvals. As with all of our products, we continually monitor the safety of Cerazette.

The condition has caused her brain to swell, which has left her unable to talk, walk, or to feed herself, the Daily Record Daily Record reports.Her parents Emilia Blanaru and Mark Forsyth, who have separated, have even described the devastating illness as rendering their daughter a new born baby again.Nonetheless, tough Lexie has fought back against the condition, following months of therapy and a staggering  days in hospital. She has astounded medics and is now able to make the -minute walk to nursery – ­something her parents feared might never happen. Doctors are unable to say whether she will make a full recovery and she still uses a wheelchair for long distances. But Emilia said: “Like a baby, she had to learn everything from the beginning again. We had to lt her up, she couldn’t walk, or sit, or feed herself.We had to put her in nappies again. “But she never gave up. We just take it little by little each day.” Lexie, who lives with her mum and brother Daniel, two, in Inverness, has been crowned Brave Child of the Year at a Highland Heroes awards ceremony.

The flat based in south-east London, has a courtyard garden, double-glazing and permit parking, but bargain buyers will be amazed when they see in the inside.The home is less than appealing on the inside and only has  years left on lease.The £, flat on Morena Street in Catford, is in need of urgent work and repair. In one bedroom, pictures show a half-packed suitcase which appears to be lying open on a bed, while a dress has been hung from a curtain pole. The second bedroom is filled with junk, including chairs, a clothes horse and a bucket. The hob in the kitchen is coated with grime and filth, with a kettle and dirty pans stacked on top. A rubbish bag still hangs from a hook, The Sun reports.The bathroom is also grim, with stains on the floor around the toilet and sink. Bags of rubbish have been fly-tipped in the garden. Auctioneers at Town and Country Property say the home will be sold off on April .

With the Omicron iant giving rise to sub-iants like stealth Omicron and Deltacron, and ious symptoms becoming linked to the dferent iants of the virus, it can be hard to tellyouaposre suffering from Covid or just a cold.Knowingyou have Covid or a cold has become particularly dficult because the Omicron iant has symptoms that y from the classic three signs of Covid and instead overlap with symptoms of a cold. However, experts have identied two early signs that points towards you having Covid. What two symptoms are early signs of Omicron   Two early signs of Omicron, that are dferent to the main symptoms identied by the NHS, have been identied as fatigue and dizziness or fainting.Fatigue is not just feeling tired. It can be accompanied by other symptoms like headaches as well as body pain due to weak or sore muscles. Sometimes it even leads to blurred vision and loss of appetite.Dr Angelique Coetzee, who was the doctor to first raise the alarm on Omicron in South Africa - where the iant was first discovered in November  - also highlighted fatigues as one of the main signs of Omicron.  The second early symptom of Omicron is dizziness, which could potentially lead to fainting. This connection between fainting spells and Covid was first noted by a German newspaper Arztezeitung. The possibility of fainting being a Covid symptom was first discovered by doctors in Berlin, who found that Covid was triggering recurrent fainting spells in a -year-old hospital patient. What are the common symptoms of Omicron  According to the NHS, the main symptoms of Covid are still a high temperature, a new continuous cough and a loss of taste smell. However, the signs of Omicron have been found to be vastly dferent from the classic three signs of Covid established previously. A study in the infectious disease and epidemiology journal, Eurosurveillance, identied eight key symptoms of the Omicron iant. These included cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, fever and sneezing. Of these the first three symptoms were found to be the most common.What to doyou have Covid   According to government advice, you are no longer by law required to self isolateyou test positive for Covid.However, the NHS still recommends you stay at home and avoid contact with othersyou have symptoms. The advice currently states: While you’re no longer legally required to self-isolateyou have Covid-, you should try to stay at home and away from others to avoid passing on the virus.The NHS recommends you stay away and avoid contactyou have any of the main symptoms of Covid- or have tested positive for Covid-. It is recommended you take rapid lateral flow tests from five days after your symptoms start, and the next day. If both your tests are negative and you donapost have a fever youaposre less likely to pass on Covid to others.

Speaking to the Echo, Jessica said: I spoke to him on the way in and he told me that contactless payment only had a   chance of working. He saw me struggling to pay for my ticket and thataposs when he came over. I told him he didnapost have to go to the trouble but he insisted. It was only p but it was just the gesture that meant so much. And while the kind gesture may have only set the guard back p, Jessica insisted the interaction helped remind her that people arenapost all bad - despite the horrible things she often sees on the news. The woman, who moved to Southport four years ago, also said the small act of kindness had made her day, as she shared her hope that more people would do lovely and positive things for others.  She added: I think at the beginning of lockdown everyone was supporting each other which was just a lovely and positive thing. Now we are seeing all these horrible things happen on the news and thereaposs just all sorts of negativity. Sometimes I think about what is happening to humanity and then something little like that happens, which was such a small gesture and it makes you think that there are still good people out there. AndJessica ever finds herself at the retail park again, sheaposs committed to paying the security guard back - with a little extra on top to say thank you.

Kasia Lambert, , said she would rather donate the hefty amount to Ukraine than pay off Birmingham City Council. The driver who lives in France was slapped with two CAZ fines totalling £ after visiting Birmingham last summer.She claims the council refused to remove the fines despite proving that she had tried to pay the £ charge for the two days that she entered the zone. Now embroiled in a seven-month battle with the local authority, Kasia maintains she is not willing to pay.I would rather give £ to Ukraine than to those cowboys, she told Birmingham Live. Kasia claims she thought she had made two £ payments for her trip to Birmingham on August  and  last year when she entered the clean air zone. Thinking nothing of it, she then ed to her home in the French town of Hyeres. Days later, she received the penalty notices and checked her bank app to discover that the £ payments had been ed to her account. Kasia then launched an appeal believing there had to be a misunderstanding. She said: I included a screenshot of the aposrefundapos and explained there had been an error. I even offered to pay the £ again but I was told they didnapost see any reason to remove the fine.  Kasiaaposs full bank statement showed there were sufficient funds in place when she made the transaction. The £ was also shown as having left her account, before being ed later the same day. Her initial £ fines totalling £, or £ eachpaid within  days, have since tripled due to late fees being added. Kasia said: They are currently sending letters threatening me with bailfs. Itaposs like something out of Kafka. A council letter detailing Kasiaaposs unsuccessful appeal read: Your vehicle registration was within the CAZ without paying the daily charge at the time, and in the manner required. It is not the first time the appeal process has come under fire, with some believing the council preys on fear when issuing fines.Criticism is also levelled at the authority for the time it takes to process an appeal. When a driver appeals a fine it may take longer than two weeks, the time allocated for a reduced £ rate, for the authority to respond. This means thatit goes beyond  days, the standard charge of £ would applyproven guilty. The fine is therefore not frozen while an investigation takes place - giving drivers no choice but to fork out the extra cash despite the council overrunning.

TikTok user Samantha said that her sister, Hannah, worked as a recruiter and had landed a series of interviews for a client who was unfortunately unsuccessful.The client didnapost manage to secure the job and Hannah let them know over email, then soon she had a reply that had no text and just one image. The client, who remains anonymous, sent a meme in response - and itaposs now been branded aposthe most Gen Zapos way to handle a job rejection. What do you think about the response  Let us know in the comments...In the video, Samantha, who uploads as @samantha_jane_, said: Of course, in recruitment, you have to occasionally tell candidates they weren’t successful in getting the job. This one candidate, who Hannah had done a round of interviews with, she didn’t get the job so Hannah emailed her and told her she hadn’t been successful. And instead of replying and being like, ‘OK, yeah, thanks for letting me know’ or whatever, this girl sends Hannah a meme, which is the most Gen Z thing Iaposve seen.

The meme in question features a painting of Pope Leo X by Fernando Botero, with the popular internet phrase aposy thoapos written in white letters over the classical artwork.

One said: Honestly I think they missed out on not hiring her. And another wrote: I love how it wasn’t even small. It’s the WHOLE PAGE Then a third added: I would’ve found her a job after that.

However, she knew she couldn’t justy spending so much on a vase, so set about thinking up a creative - and very thrty - solution.NHS nurse Teresa, from Essex, decided to try making her own vase using something of a similar shape that she already had knocking about the house – a normal bottle of Lenor Outdoorable Fabric Softener.The end result, which set Teresa back a snippy £, looked as on-trend as anything you might find in the shops, saving her £ when compared to the pricey one sheaposd seen online.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Teresa began by removing both the label and lid from the empty bottle, before using spray paint to give it the exact colour she wanted. She then wrapped string around the bottle top so as to hide the tell-tale grooves, before leaving it to dry. Guests would probably have no idea as to the cheap and cheerful origin of Teresaaposs fashionable, patterned vase unless she told them so herself, with her creation perfectly complimenting her stylish home decor.Teresa said: “I knew exactly which bottle I would use – I just love the pattern on them. [...] “I already had the empty bottle but they are usually about £ in the local supermarkets.“I picked up a £ can of  Natural Hessian chalk spray paint from Poundland. The string I already had, but you can usually pick that up for £. By making my own vase I saved myself £. She continued: “I absolutely love it. The string on the neck and the Natural Hessian colour gives it that rustic look, while the pattern effect on the stylish column silhouette adds elegance.Shared photos of the finished look via a Facebook post, Teresa wrote: “I love the patterns on these Lenor Outdoorable fabric softener Bottles from @joyofclean so I thought, why not get out the spray paint, some string and make myself a nice decorative vase.“Obviously it may not be to everyone’s taste but I love the patterns on it and I really like how dferent it looks from a normal vase. I’m going to try it with other shaped bottles that we throw away and see how they turn out. Facebook friends admired her inventiveness and were wowed by the very professional-looking end result. One person commented, “Absolutely gorgeous!!! I often wondered what you could use these bottles for. Brilliant idea, while another wrote, “I love this, it came out so beautully. A third said: “That’s lovely! I must try this thank you, I would love to try the stone effect spray paint on it too.Do you have a money-saving hack to share  We pay for stories.

But for one woman on TikTok, the nails she walked out of the salon with were nothing like the pictures she had shown her nail technician - and the job was so bad it left her fighting back tears.Mya Balenciaga shared a video in which she showed off the stunning stiletto manicure she had been hoping to get, which featured four white nails and one that was clear with bits of confetti floating inside. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She then showed a picture of the work her technician had done, which included chunky off-white nails that were nothing like the reference picture.And instead of an elegant clear nail on her little finger, Mya - who posts under the username @myabalenciaga - was given a glittery red nail that seemed to have been glued on in a wonky position.She captioned her video: I wanted to cry so bad.Commenters on Myaaposs video were sympathetic toward her nail fail, but many of them questioned why she would go through with the rest of the appointment once she saw how disastrous the result was going to be. One person said: So you sat there and let them do that  I hope you didnapost pay... While another added: And you let them do that. You just sat there and let them finish. Please please tell me you didn’t pay for this, a third stated. Other commenters were keen to share their thoughts on what the nails looked like, with one leaving a garlic emoji to state the design almost resembled cloves of garlic stuck to Myaaposs fingers. Another person wrote: Did you ever stick your finger in warm candle wax over and over to layer it  That’s the vibe these nails give off. As someone  noted: They look like jelly beans.

It’s value before the recent slump due to the war and sanctions was around £. million. Luiza, a student, is the daughter of cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, , now part-owner of a major Russian bank, one of the countryaposs wealthiest women with an estimated £ million financial and property fortune. She has not commented on claims that her daughter was fathered by the Kremlin president, and nor has Luiza, also known as Elizaveta, although the teenager told Russian GQ that she “probably” looks “similar” to a young Putin.The suspicion that she was Putin’s secret daughter from an extra-marital affair was first aired by an independent media outlet in Russia which was later blocked by the authorities. The , square feet apartment in the sumptuous gated Fontanka  block is one of St Petersburg’s most sought after addresses in the city’s “Golden Triangle”. It is described as a “club house” with an array of “elite apartments” with construction by German company Engel  Voelkers, with “high-end” designer finishes and furnishings by Roberto Molon in an elegant and light art deco style”. Plumbing and kitchen appliances are from leading German and Italian manufacturers”.  In the prestigious development “everything is thought out to create maximum comfort, convenience and a fabulous atmosphere of beauty, comfort and coziness. “It has its own wellness centre with a swimming pool, and luxury service.” It offers “palace luxury in the spirit of modernity from Italian designers”. Reports say that Oleg Yemelyanov - linked to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny - analysed hacked Yandex Food records which became publicly available.  These showed an unknown apartment linked to Krivonogikh at Fontanka embankment number , he said. “Wow, Putin’s [ex-]mistress Svetlana Krivonogikh has a flat with total area of nearly  square metres on the River Fontanka embankment,” said Yemelyanov. “Thanks for the tip to Luiza Vladimirovna [Rozova] who has been ordering food to that address.” The propertyaposs value has sunk to £. million in the past month. Luiza has closed her Instagram after she was hit by a wave of extreme trolling over Russia’s war in Ukraine.One comment said: “Are U sitting in the bunker   Like a rat ” Luiza - who had , subscribers - stopped publicly posting six months ago, triggering the suspicion that Putin had gagged her, but her account remained open. Now a message says in Russian: “User not found.”  One post on the -year-old’s Instagram alleged she was the “daughter of a murderer, war criminal, psychopath and drug addict”. Many posts included the Ukrainian blue-and-yellow flag and one carried the message: “The Russian nation must rise against this dictator. You donapost want to have anything to do with him.” But commenters also staunchly defended her, with one saying: “Donapost judge her...is not her fault.” Another wrote: “She cannot do anything for having a crazy father”. One more said: “Come on guys, she is just a person. She is not guilty.”  But a commenter called Martina hit back: “Yes, she is guilty of passive complicity. It is the same as most of the Germans in the Nazi period.” Another posted: “Call him -he loves you ... maybe you can convince him not to kill.” One complained: Stop writing [that] sheaposs an innocent. “She is the daughter of that devil! “She could at least show that she does not agree with what her father is doing, somehow influence him. “Putin doesnapost give a s*** for ordinary people, but maybe his daughters still mean something to him. “She stays quiet because she knowsshe says one bad word to Daddy, she will be cut off from big money, apartments and expensive things.  “Unfortunately, there are important things - and more important things. “Apparently, purses and villas are more important to her than human le.” Putin has two daughters by his ex-we Lyudmila, the former Kremlin first lady. Likewise, neither of them - Dr Maria Vorontsova, , a geneticist, and Katerina Tikhonova, , a high-kicking ‘rock’n’roll’ dancer-turned-mathematician, have commented on the war. There are reports that Putin has hidden some family members in a chalet in neutral Switzerland - while another version is that they are in a five-star hi-tech nuclear bunker in Siberia. There is speculation he has up to four children with Olympic Gold-medal winning rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, , now high-earning a media mogul in Moscow who is rarely seen in public. This would make the Kremlin strongman a father of seven. Luiza has had a higher online public profile, and was hit by a backlash over Ukraine.  One comment said: “How are you in the bunker ” A troll suspecting she may be in her mother’s Mediterranean bolthole said: “While you’re fluffing around in Monaco, people of your generation are dying in Ukraine because of your father. “Your destiny will be that of Marija Milosevic when your dad gets sent to The Hague. “SHOW YOUR FACE YOU COWARD!” She was told: “Young Russian soldiers are being sent to Ukraine without any knowledge about where they are, who they fight and what they do. “The Russian economy is collapsing, reaching absolute zero. “Soon,not already, you wonapost be able to use Netflix, Spoty, social media apps, pay with Google and Apple Pay, all popular brands and boycotting and exiting Russia.”Luiza was also told: “Many Ukrainians have forgotten about what sleep is, and even more so in bed. “After all, falling asleep, many of us run the risk of not waking up. “People spend the night in basements like rats because bombs are falling from the sky and rockets are coming. “All you need is not to be silent, not to stand aside. “ Tell people the truth about what is happening in Ukraine! “We want to live in peace and sleep peacefully in our beds, to know that in the morning our relatives and friends will be alive.” Luiza earlier showed her le at cafes, on trips to Paris, and running her own Russian fashion label. A video shows her at the Louvre museum during the pandemic. She was also seen working as an in-demand DJ.

It would abandon its drive to join NATO and vow not to develop nuclear weapons, on the basis that Russia would withdraw troops and give Kyiv security guarantees.No peace deal would be possible without a ceasefire and withdrawal of troops, he said, though he ruled out trying to recapture all Russian-held territory by force, saying it would lead to a third world war.The aim, he said, was to reach a “compromise” over the eastern Donbas region, held by Russian-backed forces since . However, Zelenskiy said Ukraine refused to discuss certain other Russian demands, such as the demilitarisation of the country.Zelenskiy hosted a video call - which the Kremlin preemptively warned Russian media not to report - to deliver his message directly to Russian journalists on the eve of a new round of peace talks in Turkey. The president has previously spoken in Russian in speeches aimed at a Russian audience. The proposed meeting midway was on condition that the changes were put to a referendum and third parties promised to protect Ukraine, he said. “Security guarantees and neutrality, the non-nuclear status of our state — we’re ready to do that. “That’s the most important point… they started the war because of it,” Zelensky said. Russia’s media censor ordered the four reporters not to publish the interview and vowed to investigate them — even though it had already blocked a site that one of them edits and shut down a TV station formerly run by another. Zelensky said Ukraine’s main goal was to end the war as quickly as possible and make Russia’s forces withdraw to their positions before Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on February .Ukraine was prepared to consider giving the Russian language protected minority status, he said.it received analogous guarantees from Moscow on Ukrainian. However, he claimed Putin had done “irreparable damage” to the Russian language in Ukraine through brutal assaults on mainly Russian-speaking cities such as Mariupol. “These Russian-speaking cities are the ones that have been wiped from the face of the earth. And these families,” Zelensky said.  He said  per cent of the buildings in Mariupol, which previously had a population of ,, had been destroyed, “but they were at least multistorey, so you can imagine what was there”. Smaller towns, on the other hand, had been completely destroyed. “I don’t know who  the Russian army ever treated like this,” the president said, adding that the destruction was worse than during Moscow’s two campaigns in Chechnya in the s and s. Zelenskiy later said in his nightly video address that he would insist on the territorial integrity of Ukraine in any talks. He said he was “. per cent sure” the Russian president had thought Ukraine would be waiting for the invasion with “flowers and smiles” — going so far as to send troops with parade dress for a victory celebration in Kyiv apparently planned for the third or fourth day of the war. But Zelensky said Ukraine was prepared to hold separate discussions on the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in , and the eastern Donbas border region, where more than , people have died in a slow-burning separatist conflict involving Russian proxies that broke out soon afterwards. “I understand it’s not possible to make Russia completely leave the territory — that’ll lead to world war three,” Zelensky said. “That’s why I’m saying this is a compromise. Go back to where this all started and then we’ll try to solve the dficult Donbas issue.” Delegations from Ukraine and Russia are set to meet on Monday in Ankara for three days of talks aimed at ending Putin’s month-long invasion. But Zelensky played down comments by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, that Ukraine and Russia were close to a deal on four points. He said peace could only be achieved through a meeting with Putin. “So we meet, we make a deal, and that’s enough — we sign a deal, stamp it, or sign it in blood. That’s enough to start the troop withdrawal process. “The troops must be withdrawn, everyone signs the guarantees, and that’s it,” Zelensky said. In exchange for giving up its desire to join NATO — an aspiration reflected in Ukraine’s constitution — Kyiv wants the new agreements to be more like NATOaposs Article  in requiring the country’s protectors to come to its aidit is attacked. Zelensky said he wanted to put the decision to a referendum, which he said would take “several months”, before embarking on constitutional changes that would require at least a year of work. “The guarantors won’t sign anythingwe have troops [on our territory]. “That’s why I think we could finish the war quickly. It’s just Putin and his entourage who are dragging it out,” Zelensky said. “Who’s going to talk about anythingtroops are still there  Who’s going to sign anything  Nothing will happen, it’s impossible.” He added that Ukraine refused to discuss two other Russian demands at the talks: “denazication” and “demilitarisation”. These were “completely incomprehensible things”, he said. Ukraine and its western backers fear Russia may be using the talks as a smokescreen while it regroups its forces for a new offensive and builds up new battle groups near the border.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

It’s part and parcel of football.“The good thing is they’ve been minor injuries but it’s been two consecutively on the bounce.”With his Rangers contract up in the summer, Davis knows there are a crucial few months ahead.Baraclough may get fed up of questions about his captain’s future – an irritation he voiced again on Monday – but both he and Davis will recognise the midfielder’s club situation will be critical to how long he has left as a Northern Ireland player.“I’ve not really thought about too much beyond the end of this season,” Davis added. “It’s the same situation I’ve been in these last couple of years in terms of contract talks only coming to fruition at this kind of stage.“My main aim coming into this week was to try and get some fitness and play for your country another couple of times, come away with some good performances and help us prepare for the games in June. Then go back to the club for a really important run-in and then see how things are after that….remove“You always reflect, the same as I said after the last campaign. It was about reflection and there were so many questions, would I retire or not “It was never really at the forefront of my mind. I think it’s important, especially as you get older, you can’t look too far ahead and it’s important I just finish this season strongly and go from there.”Ain midfield for Davis will be one of a number of changes Baraclough is expected to make on Tuesday, having reflected on a victory which came despite a “mixed bag” of a performance in Luxembourg, where Northern Ireland started and finished brightly but allowed the hosts to dominate possession.Paddy McNair is fit again after missing the Luxembourg trip through injury, while Bailey Peacock-Farrell has joined up after playing for Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend.The likes of Ali McCann and Dan Ballard will also hope to get starts as Baraclough freshens up his side to take on a Hungary team who are preparing for a Nations League campaign which will pit them against England, Italy, and Germany this summer.“We want a positive performance,” Baraclough said. “We’re going to make changes and we’re going to freshen it up a bit but we still have to have that intensity in game irrespective of opposition.“Hungary are going to be sterner test, no disrespect to Luxembourg, but we’re going to have to be bang at it.“A team that has got into the top tier of the Nations League is a team to be feared for sure.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Goalscorer Steven Davis looking for further boost with Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 4 2022","story":"Ukraine may be fighting one of the biggest and most powerful countries on earth, but it has the strength of the world behind it.The conflict has been described as a #David versus Goliath# war, with Ukraine battling to hold off the armies of its vast neighbour.Despite everything the country is going through, Ukraine#s leaders, military personnel and civilians have proved themselves to be tenacious, resilient, brave – and humorous!Videos showing Ukrainian soldiers dancing to pop music have gone viral on social media, with their ability to live in the moment earning them fans around the globe.Just last year, Ukraine celebrated  years of independence and now its sovereignty is being threatened in the worst way.The preservation of human le should come before all , and any military intervention by NATO countries would undoubtedly increase the death toll exponentially by turning the situation into a global conflict.Will the rest of the continent sit back indefinitely and do nothing but send weapons and impose sanctions while a European country battles for its existence "},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022","story":"One of the five tenets of taekwon-do is indomitable spirit.That is something which has been displayed in abundance in the last two weeks, since Russian forces invaded Ukraine.Despite all they are currently facing, Ukrainian soldiers took time on Tuesday, on International Women#s Day, to hand flowers to women they stopped at checkpoints.Viral videos of off-duty Ukrainian soldiers dancing in their unorms continue to flood social media.And, amid leading the fight against Russian invaders and holding meetings with world leaders, the country#s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, welcomed the start of spring in an outdoors video, ending the broadcast with a wink to the camera.The strength of spirit Ukrainians continue to show, from the bottom to the very top, should be an inspiration to us all.Kintyre has already shown incredible community spirit in its response to the crisis – well done to every person who contributed.And, although it might not effect change on a global scale, SG Taekwon-Do#s display of support for Ukraine shows that there are people in every corner of the world willing to stand up for democracy and what they believe is right."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 11 2022","story":"The Campbeltown Courier printed a story in February  about a painting, Village in the Valley, by H Shapiro.A reader then wrote to you, letting you know that the painting was by Hyman Shapiro and informed you that he had three children.I am one of Hyman Shapiro#s granddaughters.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition.

I had slowly started to think that it was a once-in-a-letime opportunity until fortune smiled upon me one more time.About two weeks ago, I had a busy day at work. To recharge my batteries, I decided to go on a quick walk with the camera.Short-eared owl. Image: Zan BlaszczykAs soon as I left the house, the weather changed its course and the sky was shortly covered by nimbus clouds. Normally I wouldhome and grab my raincoat, but I did not want to waste time.When I arrived at the local reserve, the first rain droplets fell on the ground and the place became deserted. I took a wander and soon spotted a familiar flight pattern above the marshes. Upon checking through my camera, I confirmed it was a short-eared owl.The bird was flying low and patrolling the ground for voles. It even managed to catch one but it was tricky to get a good-quality photo due to the distance between us. The bird flew past me on a couple of occasions but the weather was getting worse with every minute so I headed back home. The word about the owl must have spread, as when I ed two days later, I met other fellow photographers looking for the stunning bird.I ed to the same spot as previously and sat on a rock and waited patiently. Shortly afterwards, a graceful owl with a wingspan of around cm appeared on the horizon. Without changing my position, I started following the bird with the camera. Imagine my surprise when the owl flew over me and looked straight at the camera! I silently shouted to myself: “Wow!”As soon as the owl flew behind me, I slowly turned back and spotted the second bird. Both owls were flying towards each other and, as they met halfway, they started their ‘sky dance’.The male began to rise in the sky whilst performing a combination of dynamic wing beats and gliding down, then rising again. He also made several squeaky calls accompanied by dynamic wing claps at high speeds! After repeating the whole sequence a few times, he started falling from the sky. The female joined in and they started going at each other: the birds were e-bombing one another and attacking with their talons. That aerial display lasted for about  minutes until the birds separated. What a scene it was!Courtship behaviour is spectacular for this species: often, two birds will lock their talons and, whilst holding onto each other, they will start tumbling nearly to the ground before letting go.I encourage everyone who has a chance to observe this behaviour, as this is a ‘must’ in the birding world. It is worth remembering, though, that this species is sensitive to disturbance and their numbers are considered declining during the past two decades. It is crucial not to approach the owls or their nesting site. For your observation, I would recommend choosing one spot and remaining there. This way, you have a chance to show them that you are no threat to them and hopefully the owls will get used to your presence. I prefer this technique rather than hiding as, considering owls’ excellent eyesight, it is almost impossible to stay unnoticed. By waiting at the same position, we can also eliminate another factor, which is chasing off their prey: as we walk, the ground shakes under our feet and small mammals, such as mice or voles which the owls feed on, will disappear. Short-eared owls like marshy and boggy places, so it is important not to walk over the rich habitat but use paths.www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lensIf you have owls living in your backyard or would like me to photograph and feature wildle from your area, please get in touch!"},{"url":null,"title":"brunton-musselburgh-children-star-bugsy-malone","story":"Youth acting group Drama Mill auditioned  children for the show, and now has a cast of  children from North Berwick, Aberlady, Gullane, Cockenzie and Haddington, aged from eight to .Linda Kearsley Ross, Drama Mill director, said that the performance – the group’s first foray into musical theatre – was “ambitious” but that the children had loved taking on the roles of s New York gangsters.County children to star in Bugsy MaloneShe added: “Bugsy Malone was our first choice of play.“Drama facilitators Claudia Overton and Stephanie Wynne and I have all taken part in productions when we were at school and have fond memories of performing this play.“It’s ambitious to do it with such a young castbut our fabulous talented group have risen to the task.“This is the first time we have performed at The Brunton and we are so excited to give our youngsters the opportunity to perform on a professional stage.”The cast will perform the famous musical numbers accompanied by a live nine-piece band, whose members are all volunteering their time and talent.Drama faclitator Stephanie Wynne coaches the young Bugsy Malone castAnd the production will emulate the original  film, starring Jodie Foster, by using splurge guns and foam pies.Linda said: “There is something really fun about playing gangsters and molls, and using splurge to take people down rather than bullets.“Some people criticised that the ending is really abrupt, i.e. that they all become friends and sing a song, but I don’t think children question the ending – they believe bad people can become good people and that, as the words say, ‘ you give a little love then it all comes back to you’.”Tickets can be bought via    or thebrunton en-GB shows bugsy%malone events -

On the way to beautul Oak Park, the L metro line passes through appalling slums, illustrating the stark inequality generated by the American model of capitalism.I prefer the models adopted by some of our European neighbours, especially in the north. Tax rates are higher on those who can afford to pay, those who have been lucky in le state intervention to tackle poverty and the problems that come with it is greater. The outcome is a more equal and, from most analyses, a happier society.Scotland has a choice. We can carry on as we are, with an acceptance that the poor and disadvantaged will always be with us or we can get serious about building a fairer and more equal society, with as many as possible benefiting from the wealth of our nation. What’s clear is that we’ll never make the changes needed to build a better society while tied to Westminster and its regular succession of Tory governments.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.WILL SNP STICK TO ITS TAX GUNS THE SNP lauded its introduction of the p income tax rate to help those on low earnings. This rate however has a cap of only applying up to £,. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, has now introduced the same rate but it will apply up to £, . The SNP has been keen since the Chancellor’s announcement to say that it also has a p starter rate but has kept quiet on the top limit for it. Those in Scotland currently earning between £, and £, pay % – a substantial dference.When the new rate is implemented in , what will the SNP do  Stick to its guns of taxing those in this bracket this higher rate and risk employees seeking work in England, or give Scottish teachers, junior doctors, office staff and others in this bracket the same level of taxation  Scotland already struggles to get staff for our education, NHS and business sectors without discouraging talented people and businesses looking to invest in Scotland.Time will no doubt tell.Jane Lax, Aberlour.SCOTTISH MPS LONG BEEN EUNUCHSWHEN Peter Russellwrites of “the pygmies of Holyrood or the Scottish eunuchs of Westminster”, and in particular the latter, does he include his own party – Anas Sarwar, Jackie Baillie et al – or only the SNP  Is Douglas Ross excluded from this opinion  Or Ian Murray More seriously, does he have in mind some earlier time, lost in the mists of history, when Scottish MPs were influential, were not eunuchs, at Westminster  Currently, MPs from Scottish constituencies are nine per cent of Westminster MPs. In  that same representation was almost %. Does Mr Russell consider the dference between being influential and the fate of the eunuch to be represented by those two numbers Of course, in  Scottish MPs were influential – Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, George Robertson, John Reid et alHowever, was this not a reflection of internal Labour politics rather than anything to do with, until devolution, Westminster being the \"only game in town for Scottish politicians\"  Is it not then true to say that with their often-irrelevant level of representation, particularly when Scotland has voted for another party, that Scottish MPs have always been eunuchs, other than via successful politicking within their own party Earlier on he claims thatthe Scottish electorate voted for SNP MSPs “to do things well, or even competently … the SNP would be much less successful at the polls”. At the last Holyrood election constituency vote , the SNP won nearly % of the vote. This is more than Conservative and Labour combined, so what does that say of them  Mr Russell and those of his opinion would be better served trying to understand the electorate, rather than slandering them.Alsasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* PETER A Russell’s letter was a derogatory analysis of devolution and one I totally disagree with.He suggested that voters voting for an SNP MSP do not expect them to be competent constituency representatives – but many SNP MSPs work very long and hard in their constituents interest. Increased majorities speak for themselves in my constituency the SNP MSP received the largest vote for any candidate ever in the Falkirk West constituencyand was re-elected for a fourth time.It may come as a surprise to Mr Russell, but in our parliament we have many well-educated and professional MSPs who have the interest and welfare of their constituents at the forefront of their reasons to give up their careers and work in the interest of making a dference.Catriona C Clark, Banknock.THE VOTERS NEED TO GET ANGRYDESPITE Richard Allisons accurate description of Scotlands demise under the SNP and Greensthe most recent poll I can findforecasts the SNP vote share to rise from  per cent in the  council elections to a % forecast in May. So no bloody nose there, it would seem. Mind you, the same pollster forecast a % SNP vote share in March , so perhaps theres hope.But are people really angry enough to get off their settees and vote them out  In eachthe last six elections since  no more than . million out of m No voters in  have voted for the pro-UK parties.If even k of the missing k get out and vote for pro-UK candidates that could have a disastrous effect on the SNP vote in an election where the STV voting system effectively awards seats by vote share, not the vote-splitting \"winner takes all\" in a General Election.The problem in Scotland, however, is the vast majority of our .m registered voters are still oblivious to what is going on, wouldnt know a defunct Ferguson ferryit docked in their back garden, and the opposition parties continually fail to breach this wall of apathy with any compelling, positive, convincing message.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.WHO WILL COME TO THEIR SENSES NEIL Mackay’s article on the current state of the SNPwas, in my view, spot on.However, what is very concerning is that since the referendum in  the SNP has on a number of occasions tried to convince the Scottish electorate that the majority has wanted to cancel our union with the rest of the UK.Even when the SNP was riding high around  per cent of us were concerned about the realities of the situation now that Mr Mackay has highlighted the mess that it is in will the other % now come to their senses, or simply dream on  W MacIntyre, East Kilbride.LETS HAVE AN OPEN ABORTION DEBATEIRENE Munropresents a refreshingly balanced narrative on abortion. We would all wish to avoid the crass politicisation of the abortion debate in the United States, whereby the subject has become something of a political football, with harsh and ungracious rhetoric on both sides. That said, the fact remains that serious debate about the ethics of abortion remains all but off limits in Scottish politics.This is unfortunate, in that it sometimes seems aslegitimate concerns about the rights and welfare of unborn children are shut down and ignored. It would be heartening indeedour MSPs, regardless of their own views, felt able to cultivate an environment whereby those with deeply-held concerns about abortion, as well as for the welfare of mothers, were heard.Michael Veitch, Parliamentary Officer, CARE for Scotland, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-snp-admit-covid-restrictions-mistakes","story":"In early March  I watched an interview with Dr Michael Osterholm, world-renowned US epidemiologist and Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policyat the University of Minnesota. He worked with SARS, MERS and Ebola, and gave an insightful overview of what he thought would happen with Covid-, stating it would be a global pandemic lasting months with a high mortality rate.He explained it was an airborne virus transmitted through aerosols in indoor environments and could be spread by asymptomatic people. Those at greatest threat would have co-morbidities, especially over-s, obese and the elderly. Children were rarely affected, normal hand hygiene was sufficient, but trying to stop the virus was like “trying to stop the wind”.All proved to be true, and he also took time to explain what he didn’t know, and was still learning. That is why I trust in his opinions.But pertinently he stated cloth and surgical masks were no use against a virus, but N respirators were .Meanwhile our governments told us Covid spread through symptomatic people, from droplets via coughs and sneezes, kept us indoors, whilst grasping at anything that could be a mitigation. And that’s when face coverings came to prominence, and taken up enthusiastically by the media who suppressed any alternate view.But what of “following the science”  I remember Professor Jason Leitch changing his stance on face coverings when they were becoming mandatory, announcing they “may” give protection, but no actual evidence.In October  the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policypublished a two-part report on all the major face coverings studies and concluded: “Its time to get realabout masks… We are well past the emergency phase of this pandemic, and it should be well known by now that wearing cloth face coverings or surgical masks, universal or otherwise, has a very minor role to play in preventing person-to-person transmission. It is time to stop overselling their efficacy and unrealistic expectations about their ability to end the pandemic.”A few weeks ago I saw another interview with Dr Osterholm who stated cloth and face masks were nothing but “fashion statements”, and vaccination and ventilation were the most effective mitigations. If the Scottish Government has any evidence to refute this it should share it with all of us, and send it through to Cidrap.Throughout this pandemic we have had the most restrictions of any part of the UK, but the overall impact of Covid- remains similar. Therefore something must be wrong. It is time to review the measures taken, revise and promote those that work, and be honest enough to admit mistakes. How  how can we trust our Government  The longer this goes on I do not believe it is “following the science”.Mark Innes, Elgin.ARE BANKS REALLY BEHIND US WHEN my father retired from the oil construction sector, he bought a small shop. He transferred all cash to the local bank, and obtained bags of certain coins and notes to give sensible change to his customers, wholesalers and the like. I wonder how shopkeepers now operate in towns and villages which have no banking facilities Recently I met a -plus lady who lives on her own with few nearby friends and a son who resides by the English Channel. The local Post Office where she uplts her pension had informed her that this service was being withdrawn and she must inform them to which bank she wished to transfer this operation. Fortunately this town still has several nearby banks . What would she have doneshe had not had a local bank There are constant advertisements on television telling us that the banks are \"here for you\" or \"right behind you\". Should they not add \"somewhere\" to those adverts Now we read that banks having a low amount of business during the pandemic may be closed . Is banking now an uncaring business and no longer a professional service Can local authorities not bring pressure to bear on banks  They and their staff must use banks all the time.Bryce Drummond, Kilmarnock.WHY SLAVERY REALLY ENDEDWITH all this current brouhaha on slaves and witches Letters, March  can your readers note that one of my ancestors was an early Christian who, for his faithwas thrown to the lions in Rome for the amusement of the plebeians. Can I therefore join the chorus here and demand that the Colosseum is immediately demolished and thrown in the Tiber and the Italian Government comes up with some much-needed reparations to path my way to heaven On a more serious note, can I repeat here what you printed once before on your Letters Pages, that slavery only stopped in the UK when it was realised by the Establishment that paying slave wages was far more lucrative than owning a slave. You didn’t need to buy him or feed, clothe and house him when you have no work for him or spend even more money replacing him when you’ve worked him to death. Throw into the mix the colossal sum by way of taxpayer-funded compensation and you have the proverbial \"no brainer\".DH Telford, Fairlie.CHEAP AT HALF THE PRICETHERE have been a number of letters recently recalling the price of goods in years gone by . The only one that sticks in my mind, and is perhaps a reflection of my lestyle at that time, is that in the mid-s I could buy a pint of light beerin my local for p.

From that I paid my mother money for my “keep” and bus fares to and from work but still had enough left over for nights out with my pals and my much-loved fishing trips.It’s all relative.David Clark, Tarbolton."},{"url":null,"title":"scents-success-jorum-bets-traditional-retailing","story":"During the pandemic, this resulted in a boom in fragrance sales that has played into the hands of Jorum Studio, which bills itself as Scotland’s first and only end-to-end perfumery. With more than a decade of experience creating scents for other cult brands, the Edinburgh-based firm has doubled sales for three consecutive years with annual revenues now approaching £,.Founded by Fe-born master perfumer Euan McCall, who was later joined by partner Chloe Mullen, the business began trading in  as Jorum Laboratories after Mr McCall was asked to create some scented products to compliment the beverages of a large multinational drinks company.“I grabbed that opportunity with both hands and decided from that point onwards that this needed to be taken advantage of, and the business snowballed from there,” he said.With family interests in the extraction of aromatic oils, Mr McCall was exposed to the industry at a very young age and “fell in love and down the rabbit hole with it”. Rather than going the standard university route, he studied under a iety of professionals in a journey that took him to locations such as Barcelona, Paris and Dubai to absorb dferent cultural styles.: Scottish circular fashion specialist seals luxury technology tie-up“You can go to university and study chemical engineering but I went through a more traditional route where I studied with master perfumers and trained specically in perfumery rather than chemistry to ensure I would become a perfumer at the end of it,” he said.“A lot of people study chemistry and chemical engineering and then go to work for a fragrance company, but they might not end up being perfumers, they might be scientists in some other part of the RD chain.”Ms Mullen joined Jorum in  from another fragrance company and focuses on sales and marketing while Mr McCall oversees formulation and manufacturing. The two have a near-equal stake in the business, with the balance tipped slightly in favour of Mr McCall at %, and no external investors.They have nearly  formulation clients, most of whom are based internationally and can’t be named because of non-disclosure agreements. They also undertake work on behalf of other luxury retailers, such as big-name whisky groups, who want candles or other scented products to sell alongside their main brands.: Scottish lingerie maker LoveRose seeks to capture Dragons financial heartThe pair re-launched as Jorum Studio in  with six of their own-brand fragrances, selling direct to consumers and via distributors supplying independent speciality beauty stores in ious international markets.The own-brand range has now expanded to  perfumes, led by the most popular Trimerous and Nectary scents, with three more to launch in the coming month or two. Thereafter Jorum plans to introduce its own line of scented candles and body products.The company also continues with its BB services: “We did initially think it would have to be a case of one or the other,” Mr McCall said, “butanything both sides have accelerated.”Progress has not, however, come without signicant dficulties.“We entered international wholesaling the week before the pandemic struck us proper, so our first major retailer had just received our products as we all went into lockdown,” Mr McCall said.“We had spent a lot of time and energy speaking to a whole host of other stores which initially we had lined up to sell to, and then they got a little bit of cold feet which was understandable because they were having to close all their stores, so [developing the wholesale business] took a little bit longer than we had hoped or expected.”: Edinburgh sour beer brewery creating jobs to support growthPrices for glass, paper and natural raw materials also increased, though the biggest issue in the early part of the pandemic was securing ethanol alcohol. With nearly all supplies going into hand sanitisers, prices rose by as much as %, and even at that ethanol was at times simply unavailable.As dficult as that was, Mr McCall said Brexit continues to be a “nightmare”. Sales of Jorum’s own scents have fallen from % of direct sales revenue to almost zero as European buyers are faced with the uncertainty of import taxes on their purchases.Fortunately, the lipstick effect has driven demand where, with the US and Australia now accounting for the majority of direct sales. Europe continues to account for about half of wholesale revenues.Jorum is now looking to open additional stores to add to its current boutique in Edinburgh’s St Stephen Street. Though online growth was strong throughout lockdown, Mc McCall believes the future for perfume – which people prefer to try before they buy – depends on physical retailing.“The who’s who of the beauty and retail industry are all focusing on perfume as a ‘golden item’ within their stores,” he said. “John Lewis is doubling down and investing heavily in perfume, and Harrod’s are opening stand-alone beauty stores because they know the category is experiencing dynamic growth.“We are taking the temperature from these bigger operators. The outlook in that sense is very positive, we just have to be in a position to roll that out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed.

It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

You’ve got to take it on the chin.“I say it to him quite often about when I go back into my local butcher’s, they’re quick to tell me about we should and shouldn’t be doing, and sometimes it’s not particularly pleasant.“But during that process, he stood really firm. It would be very, very easy as the manager to maybe stake a step back, to sacrice, maybe, some of your values, your principles for a short-term view, but he stood by it and obviously I was in full support of that.”Former Ireland midfielder Andrews first spoke out in defence of Kenny in September last year and, while he admits results will always determine a manager’s future, he firmly believed Ireland were always heading in the right direction.He said: “Football being football, it’s always results-dependent and you’re always beholden to the powers that be.“It’s not development football, we’re in big boys’ football here, that’s the nature of the business that ultimatelyresults didn’t come, then decisions have to be made.“Like I said, we felt we were in a good place even though the results hadn’t been good, we were comfortable with what we were putting in place and the results did come.” and Argentina’s Ever Banega battle for the ball\" data-title\"Soccer – International Friendly – Republic of Ireland v Argentina – Aviva Stadium\" data--holder\"PA Archive\" data--notice\"PA Archive PA Images\" data-credit\"Niall Carson\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debeefffaeYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNTUNzAz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debeefffaeYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNTUNzAz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debeefffaeYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNTUNzAz ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Republic of Ireland’s Keith Andrewsand Argentina’s Ever Banega battle for the ball Andrews was drafted into the international set-up by former manager Giovanni Trapattoni, whose safety-first approach paid idends, but did not necessarily win admirers.Kenny’s approach is more expansive and while his team remains a work in progress, Andrews shares his philosophy.He said: “The Ireland team that I played in was very well organised, very dficult to break down. The main focus was what we did without the ball.“There was a big reliance on the technical players with most ability, in an attacking sense. It was based around that with a manager who probably didn’t have enough belief in what we could do, or was stuck in the way he had always seen the game and the way he always coached.“Stephen and myself see it dferently and have tried to take the team in a dferent direction.”"},{"url":null,"title":"goalscorer-steven-davis-looking-boost-northern-ireland  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

It’s part and parcel of football.“The good thing is they’ve been minor injuries but it’s been two consecutively on the bounce.”With his Rangers contract up in the summer, Davis knows there are a crucial few months ahead.Baraclough may get fed up of questions about his captain’s future – an irritation he voiced again on Monday – but both he and Davis will recognise the midfielder’s club situation will be critical to how long he has left as a Northern Ireland player.“I’ve not really thought about too much beyond the end of this season,” Davis added. “It’s the same situation I’ve been in these last couple of years in terms of contract talks only coming to fruition at this kind of stage.“My main aim coming into this week was to try and get some fitness and play for your country another couple of times, come away with some good performances and help us prepare for the games in June. Then go back to the club for a really important run-in and then see how things are after that…“You always reflect, the same as I said after the last campaign. It was about reflection and there were so many questions, would I retire or not “It was never really at the forefront of my mind. I think it’s important, especially as you get older, you can’t look too far ahead and it’s important I just finish this season strongly and go from there.”Ain midfield for Davis will be one of a number of changes Baraclough is expected to make on Tuesday, having reflected on a victory which came despite a “mixed bag” of a performance in Luxembourg, where Northern Ireland started and finished brightly but allowed the hosts to dominate possession.Paddy McNair is fit again after missing the Luxembourg trip through injury, while Bailey Peacock-Farrell has joined up after playing for Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend.The likes of Ali McCann and Dan Ballard will also hope to get starts as Baraclough freshens up his side to take on a Hungary team who are preparing for a Nations League campaign which will pit them against England, Italy, and Germany this summer.“We want a positive performance,” Baraclough said. “We’re going to make changes and we’re going to freshen it up a bit but we still have to have that intensity in game irrespective of opposition.“Hungary are going to be sterner test, no disrespect to Luxembourg, but we’re going to have to be bang at it.“A team that has got into the top tier of the Nations League is a team to be feared for sure.”"},{"url":null,"title":"national-trust-acquires-7km-stretch-dorset-coastline  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Announcing the bounce back support scheme, Mr Poots said: “Many businesses and sectors were adversely affected by the Covid- pandemic, and our agricultural shows were not immune to these effects, with all shows cancelled in  and only a few being able to take place in . This resulted in shows losing the opportunity to raise vital funds that would help prepare for the  season. “Shows play a vital role in showcasing our excellent agri-food produce and supporting our rural communities, as well as boosting our economy and the additional tourism opportunities. These shows are predominately run by many volunteers who give of their free time and I would like to extend my thanks to them for all of their hard work. “Pre-pandemic agricultural shows attracted more than , visitors. It is essential therefore that NI shows have the opportunity to run a full schedule this year to promote and facilitate future economic growth for agri-food businesses and I am pleased that I can support their efforts through the provision of the pound, bounce back support scheme I’ve announced today, which will allow each show to claim up to a maximum of poundk for new or increased costs. “Departmental officials will contact shows directly in the next few weeks to assist them in availing of my support scheme.” Looking to the future, Mr Poots has announced plans for an independent review of local agricultural shows, which will explore the potential for longer term support options and help shows remain sustainable in the years ahead. He added: “Although I am providing support to our local shows this year, I am of the view that Government departments and local councils should consider options for longer term support. “I am therefore announcing plans for an independent review to commence in the next month or two which will aim to explore future support options and guide future policy, in addition to identying new and innovative methods which would be utilised by local shows to help safeguard their future.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1635169051553.jpg--hargey_tackles_digital_exclusion_through_provision_of_free_broadband.jpg?1635169051000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220327newshargey tackles digital exclusion through provision of free broadband","story":"Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has announced the provision of free broadband for those facing digital exclusion as a barrier to work. The broadband support package will be available to eligible jobseekers through the Department for Communities’ Adviser Discretion Fund, a grant fund available to help remove barriers to employment that prevent people moving towards and into employment Minister Hargey said: “Digital exclusion has been one of the inequalities thrown into sharper focus by the Covid- pandemic. “More than ever, employers are posting vacancies online, with many having moved to online interviewing and more positions requiring people to work from home. “Therefore, not having access to broadband can be a signicant barrier to searching for, or moving into, employment. “I am tackling this by providing free broadband support which will provide broadband for eligible jobseekers who do not currently have the service.” Support for broadband through the Adviser Discretion Fund is available for a period of six months. The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast dog owner calls for removal of knuckle bone dog treats from shelves after losing beloved pet","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

He said he had never givendogs that particular bone before and decided to buy them.Air-tight packaged dog bones are often marketed as a ‘natural’ treat aimed at helping aid plaque and gum problems in dogs. However, most contain a long list of disclaimers warning buyers of potential side effects and harm they can cause.“Before I left for work on Tuesday, I give all three dogs a bone and thought nothing of it,” said Sam. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Then that evening I took the dogs out lampingand I noticed Luther wouldn’t leave my side and wasn’t getting involved like my other dogs. Next thing I turned around to seehe was OK and Luther just collapsed.”Sam rushed Luther to an out-of-hours emergency vet.“I had to wait in the car because they still had some Covid restrictions. Next thing one of the vets came out to me and showed me a full syringe of blood they had taken from Luther’s belly. That’s when I was told I better come in and say my goodbyes.”Sam said the vet report stated a fragment from a knuckle bone had pierced Luther’s stomach and tore through the lining of the abdomen, which caused fatal internal bleeding. Sam has stressed he believes Luther’s death was “needless” and “preventable” and blames retailers who sell the product. “Luther was a perfectly healthy dog, all my dogs are fit with no health conditions,” he said.Days after Luther’s passing, Sam filed a complaint with Tesco, hoping the product would be recalled. In an email, Tesco responded saying they were “unable to accept liability for what happened to Luther” due to disclaimers on the packaging, which ranged from advising customers to supervise their pets’ eating, to ensuring the bone is chewed “over multiple sittings” alongside a warning of internal injury.“All I keep thinking about is why did I buy the stupid things, I spent £ to lose the best dog I ever had,” Sam said. In response to a request for comment for this article, Tesco said they were “sorry to hear” about Sam’s ordeal but again advised a request should be sent to Favour, the brand that manufactures the dog treats instead.Contact MarketingLtd, who operate Favour dog treats and act as the distributor, not the manufacturer, said the company was “very sad to hear about this incident. However, there is an inherent risk associated with products of this type andthese products do all come with disclaimers and warnings”.It added: “A similar level of supervision is appropriate for dogs as with children, particularly with any item that is small enough to be chewed or ingested. The type of product referred to above is a natural dog chew but, as with animals chewing actual bones, accidents of this nature can occur on rare occasions.”It said as a distributor, it takes active steps to ensure that suppliers they deal with “meet a high standard in terms of the quality of products they supply”.Most ReadLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindFormer Northern Ireland Tory on upskirting and indecent child images charges‘Suits him’: Van Morrison applauded for weight loss winLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolSam McBrideOpinionDUP’s future looks increasingly grim… now party must hope damage it has done to the union is not irreparableTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayAnalysis: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adf-c-ea-c-bdd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adf-c-ea-c-bdd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlaySir Kenneth Branagh makes red carpetat star-studded Oscar ceremonyLatest Northern IrelandMan allegedly armed with kne and gun at Northern Ireland shopping mall granted bailOscars : The seven categories in which Belfast was nominated — and who wonLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings in campaign against Northern Ireland protocolKevin Hart announces new Belfast Limelight show on Wednesday March  – when are tickets on sale Ulster Unionist leader vows not to be intimidated after office attackLatestURC head of officials Tappe Henning admits that disallowed Ulster try should have stood against StormersApache Pizza creating  jobs in Northern Ireland with  new outlets – will there be one near you Man allegedly armed with kne and gun at Northern Ireland shopping mall granted bail‘Bodies in bog’ man and woman may have crossed medieval ScotlandScottish Covid- patient numbers increase again to another record high,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Their mothers.And mum was the word across social media as some of the faces took time to say thanks, share a special moment and send well wishes to mums across Northern Ireland.Among them was Lord Mayor of Belfast, Kate Nicholl, who had a special message for her own mother.The Alliance councillor and her mother Helen fled Zimbabwe for a new le in Northern Ireland, and she was one of those to show her thanks for the sacrices made in starting a new le in a new country.“Sending love to all mums and those who mother — but especially to those missing their mummies today. Endlessly grateful to my own who has sacriced so much for me,” she said.Former First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster never misses a Mother’s Day message and, true to form, she treated her mum Georgina Kelly to a day out.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “So pleased could take mum out for lunch today on Mothering Sunday,” she said, posting a photo.And the politician who could well become the second female First Minister in Northern Ireland was celebrating her own motherhood.Sinn Fein leader Michelle O’Neill was happy to show off a tempting treat she had received of elaborately decorated cakes and buns“It would be rude not to eat them all! Happy Mother’s Day,” she said. It is, after all, a day to enjoy.Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie had been trawling through his old photo albums to select a favourite photo of his own mum.“I love this picture of my mum — she looks like she is having the best time. Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers out there. #ConstanceEverlynBeattie,” he wrote.She may have had to work a sht on her BBC Radio Ulster show, but presenter Kerry McLean still had time for a message, thanking her daughter for a handmade gt.“A gt from my  year old. I was so touched and told her I loved it and how special it was, to which she replied, ‘Yeah, we were told we all had to make them. Everyone’s was the same’.”As always, it’s the effort and the thought that counts.Her BBC colleague, presenter and weather forecaster Barra Best, went further, posting several photos of himself out and about with his mum accompanied by the message: “Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers out there, especially mine. Have a great day ladies!”Last week Aodhan Connolly, head of the NI Retail Consortium, was thanking his parents, tongue-in-cheek style, after winning the St Patrick’s Day Irish Beard of the Year. But he had a special message for his mother on Sunday that will resonate with many sons across Northern Ireland:“Happy Mothers’ Day to this absolute wee legend and candle lighter in chief!” he wrote. “Still the glue that holds our family together and some woman for one woman. I’m thinking of those who don’t have their mums today. Take care of yourselves today and you’ll be in our prayers.Regular columnist and political commentator Alex Kane also had a poignant message to accompany a photo, showing mothers can come in all forms.“Mother’s Day: and the wonderful Adelaide, who rescued this terried, silent, desperate-to-be-loved child from an orphanage for no other reason than she thought she could help him. She did. She never gave up. What and who I am today is entirely her handiwork. My Mum. Her boy.”Mothers mean so much to their children, and it seems especially so in Ireland.There was another poignant message from the editor of The News Letter, Ben Lowry, whose mother died a few weeks ago.“Mum once said that I always remembered Mother’s Day,” he said. “I take consolation from that, given that I had more than the odd shortcoming as a son over the decades.“This is the first such Mothering Sunday without her. To those who still have one, savour the miracle of a mum!”Related topicsArlene FosterMichelle O#NeillDoug BeattieMore On Arlene Foster PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole position PremiumLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’DUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly election PremiumMartin McGuinness: ‘History will judge him kinder than Gerry Adams.

Pic: Jonathan McCambridge PA WireMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe results are in from our Spring  NI ‘Tracker’ poll, and we see that Sinn Fein are still comfortably in the lead as Northern Ireland’s largest party on a projected % vote share - up a % point from our Winter poll in January.Sinn Fein have now been the lead party in all polls for some time, and so they must be really hoping that they can achieve top spot in the May  election.The DUP are up two points in second place on %, and are seven points behind Sinn Fein.The other two unionist parties have dropped a bit, with the UUP on % - down a point since our January poll, and the TUV on % . Even so, this % score is still three times more than the TUV achieved in the last NI Assembly election in .So the trend is good for the DUP with perhaps some of their regular voters who moved to the TUV ing to the fold as the Assembly election approaches.However they still have a big gap to make upthey are to catch Sinn Fein, and there’s not much time left.The SDLP are at least consistent in the polls, coming in this time at % - no change from our Winter poll in January.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up  Read MoreLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindThe SDLP has been showing around the %-% vote-share mark for a long time, with no real up or down movement either way. Alliance are at %, up  points, perhaps benefiting from the UUP’s small drop.About this UUP drop, it’s noteworthy that Doug Beattie’s personal ‘leader rating’ in this poll was down  points from his January poll score, which is a hefty drop.Perhaps the Twitter posts controversy has been a factor here, and interestinglythis seems to have had more of a negative impact with female voters than males.Boris Johnson had the biggest increase in our ‘leader ratings’ - up  points from his January poll-score. This reflects the national UK-wide polls with the PM benefiting from a ‘Ukraine war bounce’. However, he still remains Northern Ireland’s lowest rated political leader at minus !Now the science of opinion polling applies to modelling and forecasting NI-wide public opinion, ie projecting vote-shares – that’s what polls do, and they usually do this pretty accurately.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:OpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionJon Tonge:OpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveBut, of course, what people really want to knowis how all these vote-shares would translate into seats at the Assembly election.As the political commentators will tell you, vote-shares don’t always translate neatly into NI Assembly seats.Indeed, it’s perfectly possible for the TUV to get a %-% NI-Wide vote-share in this election, and for Jim Allister to still be the only TUV MLA – although, with that NI vote-share, they would have to be a bit unlucky for that to happen. It’s all down to where, and in what constituencies, the votes come from.So for our last pre-NI Assembly election pollwe will be running  separate NI constituency polls with the named candidates and parties for each constituency, presented to each poll respondent.Basically the poll-participants will be presented with actual ballot they will see in each of their respective constituencies on election day. Then, like we do with all our polls, we will combine all this data into NI-wide political-party vote-share projections.This approach brings in some of the reality of the election, as there’s always a brand and loyalty factor with some named candidates. We used this approach in our very last pre- UK general election poll, and we believe it was one of the factors that allowed us to forecast that election to within %. We will seeit works as well again – we hope it does!Bill White is managing director of Belfast polling and market research company LucidTalkRelated topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblySinn FéinUlster Unionist PartyAlliance PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceSDLPLucidTalk pollMore On Northern Ireland AssemblySDLP’s Colum Eastwood leaves opposition ‘on the table’ depending on negotiations following Stormont Assembly Election PremiumSam McBrideOpinionWhy we all may be paying more for electricity thanks to Stormont failures and a little-known monopoly company PremiumLindy McDowellOpinionHow do you say ‘farcical waste of money’ in Irish and or Ulster Scots  PremiumAlex KaneOpinionUnionism remains as ided in  as it was in , now it might be too late to do things dferentlyStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesMost ReadLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindFormer Northern Ireland Tory on upskirting and indecent child images charges‘Suits him’: Van Morrison applauded for weight loss winLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolSam McBrideOpinionDUP’s future looks increasingly grim… now party must hope damage it has done to the union is not irreparableTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayAnalysis: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adf-c-ea-c-bdd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adf-c-ea-c-bdd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlaySir Kenneth Branagh makes red carpetat star-studded Oscar ceremonyLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections Jon TongeOpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveUnionists more worried about NI Protocol than living costs, reveals LucidTalk pollSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’LatestURC head of officials Tappe Henning admits that disallowed Ulster try should have stood against StormersApache Pizza creating  jobs in Northern Ireland with  new outlets – will there be one near you Man allegedly armed with kne and gun at Northern Ireland shopping mall granted bail‘Bodies in bog’ man and woman may have crossed medieval ScotlandScottish Covid- patient numbers increase again to another record high,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

For Galway trainer Murdoch Kelly this was a welcome success.

He got his chance to DJ on his own for the first time due to a double booking.He then began to DJ regularly at the Central Park nightclub in his early s, later securing a residency in The Groovy Train at the M Club in Belfast in .Paulrsquos break into radio came in  when he became a presenter with FM in Newry, part of the Q Radio Network, later becoming a breakfast presenter and eventually operations manager.He left in  and worked freelance for three years with Downtown Radio before joining U presenting the Sunday afternoon show in .In , he took on the overnight programme from midnight until am, Monday to Thursday.Paul also was a multi-award winning wedding DJ and played regularly as the recommended DJ for the Hastings Hotel Group.OrsquoHares in Newcastle paid its condolences on social media to Paulrsquos family and friends:: lsquoDJ PK was a resident here for many years and was heavily involved in the success of Central Park and Coast nightclub entertaining generations of party goers here.rsquoAfter a service at Our Lady Of The Assumption Church in Newcastle, Paulrsquos remains left for cremation in Dardistown Crematorium in Dublin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Washed up munitions a reminder of Murlough’s military history  ","story":"THE news of a controlled explosion on Murlough beach last Thursday might sound shocking.But it isnrsquot the first time that Army bomb disposal experts have detonated a suspected WWII mortar found in County Downrsquos sands.Such ordnance washes up relatively frequently, assumed to have escaped the Beaufort Dyke trench in the Irish Sea, where massive amounts of munitions were dumped after the war mdash including  tons of four-inch mortars.But stray munitions have also been found before in Murloughrsquos sand dunes, reflecting the arearsquos rich wartime history.In fact, Murlough Nature Reserve mdash formerly known as the Dundrum Sandhills mdash has interesting history that extends far beyond WWII.The name itself comes from the old Irish word lsquoMuirbolcrsquo, meaning lsquosea-bagrsquo , and evidence of human activity in the -acre reserve extends back to around  BC.Archaeological digs in the s unearthed multiple signs of burning, hundreds of pottery shards, worked flints and even carbonised hazelnut shells that confirm Neolithic and Bronze Age activity.Much later, Murloughrsquos dunes were important for the Normans. They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

But with even Australia, for example, having considered jettisoning this link over the decades, it is hardly surprisingcountries that once experienced slavery and codied, racially segregated rule do so too.The Duke of Cambridge realises that local populations will not take lectures on their future status from British leaders, least of all a young royal. Yet this tour, as royal tours typically do, showed that there is still a deep affection for that same monarchy in much of the world.Longer term, it is the future of the Commonwealth of Nations that matters more than the retention of the Queenas head of state in places that might sever that arrangement regardless. The association is a reflection of the huge soft power that the UK has — its cultural reach, and the links to countries around the globe.Even states that have bruising memories of empire usually recognise the upsides of the former British presence, in terms of aspects of government such as parliamentary democracy and civil administration.It was sad to learn recently of a poll that showed,anything, a diminishing appetite in the Republic of Ireland to join the Commonwealth.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We miss them, we love them, we will never forget them. “And we will never forget all of those lost in the heartbreaking, heartwarming, human story of that amazing city of Belfast on the fabulous island of Ireland.“This means a lot.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Such dedication is a hallmark of the Northern Ireland football captain’s career and has led her to making history with her squad as they head to the Women’s Euro  finals. But ahead of Mother’s Day she also has an inspiring, important message for the next generation of female sporting stars - being both mother and top athlete is possible.Marissa said: “It’s so important for women in sport to know thatthey want to have kids it can happen. That women do believe it is possible to have kids and have a career in sport.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our team we have Sarah McFadden, and she has a wee girl Harper, . She came back and played an international match three months after she gave birth. “It’s raising the awareness and telling the stories that it is possible so we can inspire the next generation of women in sport.”Growing up in west Belfast in a time when an international women’s football side wasn’t even in existence, never mind a possibility, it’s little wonder the passionate player has become a role model for women in sport and for the next generation of female athletes.“I do take pride in inspiring the next generation of girls coming up,” said Marissa.“Football has given me so much in my journey, I love to show young girls that it’s a great sport to be in. But not just football but any sport – the le lessons you learn – you can’t put a price on it. “Football’s my passion and I just want to let young girls know that football is great for your mental and physical health. I don’t know where I would be without it.”However, despite great strides being made in sport the statistics show there is still work to do. A signicant gap between men and women taking part in sport still exists, with women less likely to have taken part in sport at least once within the last year, %, than men, %. Unfortunately, according to Sport NI figures this gap gets wider on our sidelines with women representing just .% of the overall sports coaching workforce in Northern Ireland and this dropping to just % for those who coach our World, Olympic or Paralympic medallists.To help close this gap Sport NI recently launched their Women In Sport Panel that sees women from dferent sporting backgrounds offering their expertise on how to overcome barriers and create more opportunities for women and girls at all levels of sport.Marissa believes that listening to women and funding in sport are key factors in closing the gap.“It’s so important to listen to women from all levels of sport to be able to improve experiences and see what we can do better. This  also gives visibility to women who are in sport, coaching, leadership, and governance levels. That is so very important for females to see these real-le scenarios and see that it’s possible to achieve these roles.”Marissa points to Angela Platt, Irish Football AssociationDirector of Women’s Football and Women In Sport Panel member, as an inspiring example.“It is very powerful to have a female in the director’s role and to have that role created for the first time, especially as football is still very male dominated,” she said.The Cltonville player coach, who is mum to Quinn, , seems to have found the enviable balance between family le and her job on the pitch. She’s quick to credit her supportive partner Paula and the recent funding from the IFA, sponsors, and the Department for Communitiesfor helping make that work – le balance happen.“In January we got fully funded to train professionally. So those who were working fulltime got put on secondment and are training up at Newforgefulltime,” she explained.It means that Marissa’s job as the IFA’s Girls’ Participation Officer has been put on hold until September, after the World Cup qualiers next month and the Euros in July. “That has been a massive gamechanger for me.”Not only is it allowing Marissa, and the rest of the women’s international team to concentrate on their game, but for the captain she’s getting precious time with her little boy.“I’m able to drop him off and pick him up at creche. We get home, make dinner and have normal family le. Whereas before we got the investment to go fulltime you were working in your day job and were out most evenings. My partner was doing an awful lot whereas now it’s nice to have that family time. “I’m fortunate to have a supportive partner there who understands what it means to play at this level. Obviously, we go away a lot so that can be tough. “But at the same time, I know that I do it for the love of the game – it’s my thing. For our Quinn, I just think it will be amazing for him to look back on. I know he’s only two now but at least I’ll have a great story to tell him. It’s better for him to believe he can do anything.“We as the women’s international team have made our dreams come true in what we have achieved. I think it’s important for him to see his mum achieve what we have achieved and hopefully that will inspire him when he’s older.”As Quinn chats away in the background Marissa reveals he’s already showing some promise with his feet.“Quinn loves football. We have footballs of all sizes and shapes here. He’s ‘mama football’ and we play away. He does associate football with me so when football is on TV, he’s ‘mama, mama.’”As for now Marissa is the first to admit she’s “living the dream”.She has the Euros to look forward to and the World Cup qualiers coming up against Austria, April , and England, April .“We’re solely focused on getting into that squad and getting the squad prepared for those big games. They’re two unbelievable sides and two massive games so we have to make sure we’re fully ready for it,” she added.“The momentum we’ve built here within the women’s game here is incredible. If you look back three years ago, we would have had maybe  people watching us play. Obviously off the back of our success and qualying for the Euros there are over , tickets sold for the England game at Windsor. “It’s really hard to believe. I definitely think it’ll be an emotional day when we’re there at Windsor with that many fans.“There’s a lot to look forward to.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

A plan to redevelop the venue into a ,-capacity stadium has been beset by delay and controversy.The contents of the letter provoked a backlash from other executive parties, including UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt who claimed Mr Lyons was acting prematurely in discounting support for the bid, and Sinn Fein’s John Finucane who said a “can do attitude” was needed.However, a Department for Economy spokesperson later told the News Letter that “departmental officials remain involved in the process,” and added: “The Minister fully supports our involvement in any bid, but, as Northern Ireland enters the pre-election period it will be for a new Executive to formally agree our participations.“While there are clearly obstacles in place at the moment, the Minister is confident these can be overcome.” Gordon LyonsNorthern IrelandIrelandDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularJamie Bryson rejects idea of cutting funding to UVF-linked groups after Simon Coveney security alertNorthern Ireland weather forecast: Hope you made the most of the weekend sun - snow could be on the wayMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year WATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rallyUVF row: ‘Ignoring peaceful protests undermines loyalist leaders’ says LCC after Simon Coveney security alertMost PopularBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakBeautul bouquets for Mother’s Day UK : the best flowers to have delivered to mum for Mothering Sunday best weighted blankets  for adults and kids: from Argos, Amazon, Wayfair and LakelandAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock - here’s how to buy online, and how much it costsRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and Birmingham                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

You’ve got to take it on the chin.“I say it to him quite often about when I go back into my local butcher’s, they’re quick to tell me about we should and shouldn’t be doing, and sometimes it’s not particularly pleasant.“But during that process, he stood really firm. It would be very, very easy as the manager to maybe stake a step back, to sacrice, maybe, some of your values, your principles for a short-term view, but he stood by it and obviously I was in full support of that.”Former Ireland midfielder Andrews first spoke out in defence of Kenny in September last year and, while he admits results will always determine a manager’s future, he firmly believed Ireland were always heading in the right direction..removeHe said: “Football being football, it’s always results-dependent and you’re always beholden to the powers that be.“It’s not development football, we’re in big boys’ football here, that’s the nature of the business that ultimatelyresults didn’t come, then decisions have to be made.“Like I said, we felt we were in a good place even though the results hadn’t been good, we were comfortable with what we were putting in place and the results did come.” and Argentina’s Ever Banega battle for the ball\" data-title\"Soccer – International Friendly – Republic of Ireland v Argentina – Aviva Stadium\" data--holder\"PA Archive\" data--notice\"PA Archive PA Images\" data-credit\"Niall Carson\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debeefffaeYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNTUNzAz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debeefffaeYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNTUNzAz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debeefffaeYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNTUNzAz ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Republic of Ireland’s Keith Andrewsand Argentina’s Ever Banega battle for the ball Andrews was drafted into the international set-up by former manager Giovanni Trapattoni, whose safety-first approach paid idends, but did not necessarily win admirers.Kenny’s approach is more expansive and while his team remains a work in progress, Andrews shares his philosophy.He said: “The Ireland team that I played in was very well organised, very dficult to break down. The main focus was what we did without the ball.“There was a big reliance on the technical players with most ability, in an attacking sense. It was based around that with a manager who probably didn’t have enough belief in what we could do, or was stuck in the way he had always seen the game and the way he always coached.“Stephen and myself see it dferently and have tried to take the team in a dferent direction.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Keith Andrews lauds  ustrong u Stephen Kenny for character during early struggles article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityDavis is in line to start the match after coming off the bench to score his th international goal in Friday’s - win over Luxembourg, clocking just under half an hour in only his fourth appearance for club or country since December .“It was really nice to get on the pitch and build up fitness,” Davis said. “It’s been a good week for me so far, hopefully I can get some more minutes tomorrow and take another step in the right direction.”Davis has been limited at Ibrox since Giovanni van Bronckhorst replaced Steven Gerrard in November, hit by niggling injuries which have seen him come in and out of the squad but play only five league minutes – a late substitute appearance in last month’s - win over Hearts – in almost four months.“It’s always frustrating,” the -year-old said. “I’ve missed out on some big games and just when I felt I was getting myself back to a good position I’ve picked up another injury. It’s part and parcel of football.“The good thing is they’ve been minor injuries but it’s been two consecutively on the bounce.”With his Rangers contract up in the summer, Davis knows there are a crucial few months ahead.Baraclough may get fed up of questions about his captain’s future – an irritation he voiced again on Monday – but both he and Davis will recognise the midfielder’s club situation will be critical to how long he has left as a Northern Ireland player.“I’ve not really thought about too much beyond the end of this season,” Davis added. “It’s the same situation I’ve been in these last couple of years in terms of contract talks only coming to fruition at this kind of stage.“My main aim coming into this week was to try and get some fitness and play for your country another couple of times, come away with some good performances and help us prepare for the games in June. Then go back to the club for a really important run-in and then see how things are after that….remove“You always reflect, the same as I said after the last campaign. It was about reflection and there were so many questions, would I retire or not “It was never really at the forefront of my mind. I think it’s important, especially as you get older, you can’t look too far ahead and it’s important I just finish this season strongly and go from there.”Ain midfield for Davis will be one of a number of changes Baraclough is expected to make on Tuesday, having reflected on a victory which came despite a “mixed bag” of a performance in Luxembourg, where Northern Ireland started and finished brightly but allowed the hosts to dominate possession.Paddy McNair is fit again after missing the Luxembourg trip through injury, while Bailey Peacock-Farrell has joined up after playing for Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend.The likes of Ali McCann and Dan Ballard will also hope to get starts as Baraclough freshens up his side to take on a Hungary team who are preparing for a Nations League campaign which will pit them against England, Italy, and Germany this summer.“We want a positive performance,” Baraclough said. “We’re going to make changes and we’re going to freshen it up a bit but we still have to have that intensity in game irrespective of opposition.“Hungary are going to be sterner test, no disrespect to Luxembourg, but we’re going to have to be bang at it.“A team that has got into the top tier of the Nations League is a team to be feared for sure.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Goalscorer Steven Davis looking for further boost with Northern Ireland article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Announcing the bounce back support scheme, Mr Poots said: “Many businesses and sectors were adversely affected by the Covid- pandemic, and our agricultural shows were not immune to these effects, with all shows cancelled in  and only a few being able to take place in . This resulted in shows losing the opportunity to raise vital funds that would help prepare for the  season. “Shows play a vital role in showcasing our excellent agri-food produce and supporting our rural communities, as well as boosting our economy and the additional tourism opportunities. These shows are predominately run by many volunteers who give of their free time and I would like to extend my thanks to them for all of their hard work. “Pre-pandemic agricultural shows attracted more than , visitors. It is essential therefore that NI shows have the opportunity to run a full schedule this year to promote and facilitate future economic growth for agri-food businesses and I am pleased that I can support their efforts through the provision of the pound, bounce back support scheme I’ve announced today, which will allow each show to claim up to a maximum of poundk for new or increased costs. “Departmental officials will contact shows directly in the next few weeks to assist them in availing of my support scheme.” Looking to the future, Mr Poots has announced plans for an independent review of local agricultural shows, which will explore the potential for longer term support options and help shows remain sustainable in the years ahead. He added: “Although I am providing support to our local shows this year, I am of the view that Government departments and local councils should consider options for longer term support. “I am therefore announcing plans for an independent review to commence in the next month or two which will aim to explore future support options and guide future policy, in addition to identying new and innovative methods which would be utilised by local shows to help safeguard their future.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eceaaeffcffebfbbcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adabafaeaeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1635169051553.jpg--hargey_tackles_digital_exclusion_through_provision_of_free_broadband.jpg?163516905100","title":"hargey tackles digital exclusion through provision of free broadband ","story":"Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has announced the provision of free broadband for those facing digital exclusion as a barrier to work. The broadband support package will be available to eligible jobseekers through the Department for Communities’ Adviser Discretion Fund, a grant fund available to help remove barriers to employment that prevent people moving towards and into employment Minister Hargey said: “Digital exclusion has been one of the inequalities thrown into sharper focus by the Covid- pandemic. “More than ever, employers are posting vacancies online, with many having moved to online interviewing and more positions requiring people to work from home. “Therefore, not having access to broadband can be a signicant barrier to searching for, or moving into, employment. “I am tackling this by providing free broadband support which will provide broadband for eligible jobseekers who do not currently have the service.” Support for broadband through the Adviser Discretion Fund is available for a period of six months. The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edfaafbbfb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcbddbdaadfcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
