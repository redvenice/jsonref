First he filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming he \u0027couldn\u0027t afford\u0027 the $5million demo cost. That was dismissed.Then he filed an appeal against Judge Karlan\u0027s order to tear down the giant house. That too was denied.He went to California\u0027s Supreme Court to try to save his project. But the state\u0027s highest court torpedoed his efforts, refusing even to hear the case.Still undeterred, Hadid\u0027s lawyers filed a second appeal - this time against Judge Karlan\u0027s decision to appoint a receiver to oversee destruction of the house.

In Aberdeenshire more than 30 schools were closed due to the forecast heavy snow.Ferry passengers also faced disruption today due to adverse weather. Caledonian MacBrayne said that some services were liable to disruption or cancellation at short notice due to the conditions.Storm Eunice follows strong winds from Storm Dudley that caused significant disruption to rail and ferry services, with trees blown on to train tracks and overhead power lines.Scotland\u0027s Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government\u0027s resilience team and that Storm Eunice \u0027will bring risk of snow and strong winds across most of Scotland on Friday and danger of coastal flooding in south-west Scotland\u0027.He added: \u0027Please follow all advice and only travel if safe to so do.\u0027With more than 20cm of snow predicted on higher ground and 5cm elsewhere, Scottish Mountain Rescue warned there was a risk of \u0027dangerous conditions\u0027 including the possibility of avalanches.The organisation\u0027s vice chairman Kev Mitchell said: \u0027The weekend forecast is for very unsettled and, at times, dangerous conditions.\u0027With the arrival of Storm Eunice on Friday, hills will see high winds and the potential for snowfall to low levels meaning the avalanche forecast will be likely to worsen.\u0027Good decision-making is key in these situations and often the decision not to go, whilst correct, is the hardest one to make.\u0027Specialist mountain weather forecasts are predicting sustained periods of gales or hurricane-force winds on higher terrain for the next week, with snow, rain and hail expected most days.Mountaineering Scotland\u0027s safety adviser Ben Gibson said: \u0027With such extreme weather being forecast it\u0027s important to plan your journeys around conditions rather than just going for long-held ambitions.\u0027Check the specialist mountain forecasts and what the Scottish Avalanche Information Service says, and take an honest look at your fitness and skill levels - and those of the others in your party - and consider whether your planned route is really attainable or whether you should adapt it or make different plans altogether.\u0027Despite the snow forecast, ScotRail said it does not expect the same levels of disruption from Storm Eunice as from Storm Dudley but has pre-emptively announced some trains will not be running.Glasgow and Edinburgh trains to Arbroath and Montrose to Aberdeen services will not run because sets of points on the line that allow trains to move tracks are not fitted with heaters, meaning they could freeze and get stuck.Network Rail Scotland announced it has five locomotives fitted with snow ploughs to use as required, it is proactively spraying de-icer on key junctions and extra staff will be deployed to deal with any problems.The Met Office yellow alert for Friday warns there is a chance of travel delays on roads, possibly with stranded vehicles and passengers, along with delayed or cancelled rail and air travel and a slight chance that some rural communities could be temporarily cut off.Forecasters said there is a small chance of power cuts and that other services, such as mobile phone coverage, may be affected.It comes after Storm Dudley caused travel disruption and power cuts to parts of the UK on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/485537558f347d2a678c4e14fd1d6f0d7b99cacc/109_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=dda9feafe69eb170b0062418b6d3adf4","title":"premier league team news weekend football countdown live","story":"Rangnick did not dish the dirt further but said: “There were players unhappy, the squad was too big, players realised they wouldn’t get game time and the atmosphere is better than it used to be a couple of weeks ago. Now, for us it’s about performing well, showing togetherness on the pitch, winning games and those are the things we can influence.” Forest say they are “extremely disappointed” but a Cherries statement says that “structural engineers have carried out an inspection of the stadium and have confirmed that the damage could pose a significant risk to supporters’ safety”. “They asked me about the club and if I’m happy,” Conte says of the Sky Italy grilling in question. “I said the club did the best it can do. We lost four players, important players for Tottenham. These players we sent away on loan cost a lot of money. Numerically you could be a bit weaker. Then I said also with Kulusevski and Bentancur we are as a squad more complete.  “I don’t understand why someone wants to create a problem between me and also in the past. A lot of stories between the chairman and the club. He knows my thoughts. It’s not important for me to go to the media. I can speak to him. “I always say that I’m enjoying my time at Tottenham and with the players. I’m always saying this.” Oh, Peter, the link’s broken! But I see what you did there.  This one shouldn’t be. “When it comes to people like Steven, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney, who were icons as players, the only question was going to be whether they wanted to take the step into football management and coaching,” Hodgson said ahead of the Hornets’ trip to Villa Park. “It’s a precarious step, it’s not a long-term profession for most people starting off in their mid-30s. It gives you a lot of wonderful things, but it also brings uncertainty. So I wondered whether they would choose to go into punditry like many of their other famous contemporaries. “I’m delighted they have chosen that route because they have so much to give. All three have shown that already and, perhaps Steven in particular with his stint at Glasgow Rangers and his beginning at Aston Villa, has shown that he has the making to be a really top manager.” Hodgson can’t afford any niceties on the pitch, mind Watford are four points from safety - leapfrogged by Newcastle and Norwich - and are still seeking their first goal under the new boss. “The doubt was Tomiyasu, which is still not perfect, but he has trained the last few days so he is in contention and we can use him so that’s really positive.”The new club champions of the world trail Manchester City by 16 points, with any thoughts of the title seemingly long gone but, buoyed by some Abu Dhabi swag, it was time for a different kind of pep talk. “The 16 points (gap on City) sounds too much, is too much, to where we want to be and what we demand of ourselves, but it’s the reality,” Tuchel said, ahead of a trip to Crystal Palace.  “To reach your targets, a realistic approach is also necessary. So we should not get confused about winning the Premier League. And we still have to realise we are in the race for top four right now, which is a huge thing in Premier League in general.  “You can do of course stuff within the season, try to improve, and this is what we do. But right now the focus has to be on a realistic approach, that we are in the race for the top four, and that maybe in the moment things are not super easy for us. “We will not start judging competitions now, the most important game is at Crystal Palace tomorrow. And after that we go switching competitions, which is positive because it shows how we are progressing. So we should not lose faith now, and not get frustrated or less passionate about what we do. We must keep on going and push ourselves to the limit.” Ruben Loftus-Cheek is fit after an Achilles problem but Reece James needs more time to recover from his long-standing hamstring issue.Zouma came down ill overnight after a week in which the defender was fined £250,000 for kicking his cat in a video posted on social media and one investigated by the RSPCA. Moyes, who has said he “knows exactly where his moral compass is,” gave this update on the player at his pre-match press conference: “Well, he’s better, but it’s taken him a couple of days to get over it. He had quite bad sickness and illness, but he’s trained the last couple of days, so I’m hoping that he’ll be available.” Asked how Zouma was mentally, Moyes added: “I think he’s probably really disappointed about what he’s done and he’s thinking about it a lot, no doubt, but overall we have tried to get him to move on. We want him to concentrate on his training. He’s really well-liked here amongst the supporters, the performances he’s put in throughout the season already, so hopefully he can focus on his football and we’ll give him as much support as we can until we get him right back to his best.” Villa have won just one of their last seven games in all competitions. Let’s check back in on his mood. “The most important thing for everyone to know is that we need to see a change in the level of performance,” a steely-toned Gerrard says. “I’m not going to sit here and talk about what my decisions are and how many changes in terms of personnel but our level has got to change. We want to finish the season strong. “I must say that this is absolutely nonsense. I have never spoken with any player about a possible change of captaincy. Harry is fully aware of that and so is Cristiano. This has never been an issue. Harry is our captain and he will stay our captain.”Rodgers has of course guided the club to successive fifth-placed Premier League finishes in the last two seasons, as well as winning the 2020-21 FA Cup, but his side - comprehensive winners in Europe last night - are 11th in the top flight and he’s found himself the subject of a bit of chatter about his future. You don’t need to be a “rocket science” to know it’s been a challenging season, he says, but he’s been purring that he’s still loving every second.   “I think it’s one where you can only do your best. I think we’ve started out on a journey here of which we are nowhere near finished. We’re nearly three years in working together and we’ve made some greats steps going forward. “Progress isn’t always linear, there’s going to be fits and starts and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist, I think it’s logic, when you see where we are this year, if you look at the players we’ve been missing. “It’s a challenge in itself to be up there competing when you have all your players fit. But we’ll keep fighting and for me, it’s about returning to our level of football and I know in time we will get to that and we’ll get players back and then that’s all you can do. “I’ve loved every second of being here. I understand the criticism, because when you don’t get results, that will always come your way. So I will take that. But for me, I love working with the players, the club have been very supportive of me and I will continue to do that until I’m told otherwise.”“As it seems, Edinson Cavani will still be out,” Rangnick has told reporters. “He’s still having some problems with his groin and on the other hand also some stomach (issue). The same is true with Tom Heaton. “Apart from that, everybody else seems to be available.” Pep Guardiola doesn’t think so but, hey, he’s only the manager. “I am not a doctor, I am sorry. The shin, the symptoms, seem much less than last season. I didn’t talk with the doctor but we will see. I don’t think he will be ready for tomorrow but hopefully for the next week.”“No, he will not be available but the extent is still not clear. “We need further assessment. It’s something with some ligaments in and around the ankle, but not the ligament, some others. And so, pretty much everything is possible in the moment: that it will go really quick and the other way around unfortunately as well. So we have to wait. “Everybody saw the picture with him in the boot, it’s a normal procedure even when you just feel something they put you in that boot. For the weekend, for sure not.” PS. Thanks, Barry. (Barry’s off to pen a Friday Fiver special.)“There’s an argument for going same again,” he told reporters. “I felt similar going into Newcastle and it didn’t quite work, so it’s not a statement of fact. “The players have to feel through the week that they can find a way into the team, if we have to change our approach to the opposition because Leeds to Southampton - two very good teams in lots of different ways. The good thing is we’ve got players who are playing well and who are hungry to get into the team.” Southampton are 10th in the table after taking four points off Tottenham and Manchester United in their previous two matches and are unbeaten in their last eight home league games. Lampard believes they are reaping the rewards for sticking with manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, who has presided over two 9-0 defeats since taking charge in late 2018. “At those points, that’s when you rely on the belief from the people above and around you and the structure in place,” he said. “They clearly have that and I think they’re a good symbol. It’s testament to the club and testament to the manager. “He keeps working in the same direction and then you see his ideas come out on the pitch and the players buying into them and they’re a very, very strong unit.”The situation has now been rectified and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. Feel free to opine or vent politely on the football, the weather or anything else that takes your fancy from this point on. “I’m really nervous and I guess just interested to see how we go because you never know until the season starts,” he told the Irish national broadcaster.  Burnley are bottom of the Premier League, seven points from safety and have not won a game since October. They do, however, have a game in hand against their rivals. After seeing Burnley hold Manchester United to a draw before being edged out 1-0 at home by Liverpool last weekend, Potter is not about to take their challenge lightly. “This league is so competitive, you only need a few things to go wrong and you can find yourself in trouble,” he said. “But Sean Dyche is a vastly experienced manager who organises the team really well. They have a fantastic attitude all the time, are a together team and everyone knows what they are doing. “The reality in the Premier League is that there are a lot of other good teams and it is hard to get points. If you draw a few games, miss the wins, maybe pick up a few injuries to key players or you fall behind in the fixture schedule, then you are playing catch-up a bit and it can be tough. “But Burnley have got the experience, they have got the know-how. I don’t think they will be writing themselves off - and I am certainly not writing them off at all. I think they will get points between now and the end of the season - we just have to make sure it is not against us.” Bielsa, who has been repeatedly hamstrung by a series of injuries to key players this season, tends not to sign deals of more than a season in duration at the end of each campaign and one suspects Leeds need him more than he needs them even if there are plenty of supporters (and neutrals) who would be devastated if he left.  Leeds are believed to be working on a succession plan in case Bielsa decides to take his business elsewhere and the American former RB Leipzig boss Jesse Marsch has been linked with the club. “It’s not a subject that we should talk about at this moment,” said Bielsa, who went on to talk about what avoiding relegation would mean for the club this season. “It’s an obligation and the injuries don’t justify the season that we’re having.” Bielsea said Stuart Dallas, who has been sidelined with injury, could be fit to play some part against Manchester Un ited but added that Liam Cooper and Kalvin Phillips will not be avaialable until March. “Dallas is recovering,” he said. “He hasn’t been discarded from Sunday’s game. Kalvin and Cooper are continuing their normal processes. The objective is that they get to March and are available. The medical calculation was 12 weeks and that hasn’t changed.”  Patrick Bamford and Leo Hjelde remain out indefinitely with respective foot and knee injuries. “Our mindset is going to be a really important part of it. We have to try to out-think Liverpool where we can. I saw them during the week and it is amazing what Jurgen has done at Liverpool in the time he has been there, it is something like 50 Champions League wins alone now. “So, yes we are coming up against a grandmaster and I am really looking forward to it. We have had some good battles against him before, but obviously I was at a different club at the time, so it would be my first with Norwich. Norwich will be without Republic of Ireland striker Adam Idah, who is expected to miss the rest of the season following knee surgery. Idah, 21, picked up knee and ankle problems during the draw against Crystal Palace. Following initial tests, it was determined an operation was needed.Tottenham Hotspur’s plans to get to Manchester today for their game against Manchester City tomorrow evening also appear to be have been disrupted although there is no suggestion the game will be postponed. One suspects these won’t be the only teams whose players and supporters will be inconvenienced by Storm Eunice and we’ll bring you more news of any disruptions as we get it.  The 31-year-old England defender, brought in from Atletico Madrid for £12m, broke a bone in his left foot after scoring the only goal in last weekend’s Premier League win over Aston Villa, Newcastle’s third in succession since his arrival. “He had his operation yesterday and that went well, so that was good news,” said Eddie Howe. “I don’t know at this moment in time how long he’s going to be out. We hope to have him back before the end of the season, but it’s obviously a significant injury, which is a big blow to us because he was performing so well. Pressed on whether or not Trippier might return before the end of the current campaign, Howe was non-committal. “In terms of a definitive time, no,” he said. “We’re going to have to see how his early rehab goes. As I said, the operation was a success, but it’s an opportunity now for someone else to step up in his place.  “But sadly, we’re going to miss his leadership skills on the pitch and everything that he was delivering for us. He’s scored two goals in the last two games which have been defining moments for us, but we’re confident we have enough quality in the squad to cover.” Germany and Spain drew 1-1 in the curtain-raiser, before England were pegged back by Canada in the second game, which finished with the same scoreline. Millie Bright opened the scoring for England with a sensational hook over her own shoulder to give them a half-time lead, but Canada equalised through Janine Beckie. England’s next game is against Spain at Carrow Road in Norwich on Sunday and kicks off at 3.15pm. In the meantime, here is Louise Taylor’s report from the Riverside last night ...  “Maguire is said to feel marginalised in terms of his authority within the United dressing-room, leading to him thinking some of the players are losing respect for him,” they say.  “There is now a growing belief within the Old Trafford dressing-room that it is inevitable Ronaldo will replace Maguire – who has been struggling for form – as captain.” Responding to the Mirror’s claims on social media, the out-of-form Maguire pooh-poohed the exclusive. “I’ve seen a lot of reports about this club that aren’t true and this is another,” he said responding to the Tweet. “Not going to start posting about everything that is written but I needed to make this one clear. We’re united and focused on Sunday. Enjoy your day everyone.” It promises to be a busy Friday so we’ll bring you news of their musings and cover all the other major talking points on a day in which Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa has already said “now is not the time to talk about his future” and Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire has felt compelled to deny media reports that he has fallen out with Cristiano Ronaldo”.

They will only remain mandatory in medical settings.The Taoiseach said the Government was following advice from Nphet and the chief medical officer Tony Holohan set out in a letter “in its entirety”, including the disbanding of Nphet itself.“We are moving from the emergency phase of the pandemic into a new transitionary phase,” he said.“The public health rationale no longer applies in terms of retaining regulations around the mandatory wearing of masks.“People may feel more comfortable wearing masks, but they won’t be mandatory.”Mr Martin said public health advice may be needed going forward, as there was a risk of new Covid-19 variants emerging, but the role of Nphet is no longer required.“I’m going to pay tribute to Nphet, thank all the members of Nphet for the work that they have done, many in a voluntary capacity over and above their normal duties,” the Taoiseach said. “Thank the chief medical officer for the work that he has been doing in very difficult circumstances over a much longer period than people might have anticipated when the pandemic first started.”‘Pandemic isn’t over’Elsewhere Tanaiste Leo Varadkar said Nphet, will not be immediately disbanded, and he warned despite the loosening of Covid-19 restrictions “the pandemic isn’t over”.Speaking to reporters in Tipperary, Mr Varadkar said : “Nphet isn’t being stood down just yet, it will fade away, but it’s also a body that can be reconstituted”.The Tanaiste said he “didn’t always agree” with Nphet’s advice on the pandemic, but he thanked it for “providing us with very good advice and guidance over the past two years”.“It’s important to say the pandemic isn’t over, and the (virus’s) positivity rate is still very high I’m hearing of people I know everyday who are still testing positive with Covid-19.”Mr Varadkar said PCR testing will be focused predominantly to “senior citizens and medically vulnerable people”.New VariantsHowever, he said despite most of the population building up “a very high level of immunity, the one thing we can’t rule out, unfortunately, is the possibility of a return of the virus in a new form”.“There will be new variants, but there is always the risk of a new variant that has significant vaccine escape immunity from the vaccines and infection will wane and of course there will be another winter.”“So, we have to be on guard, and we have to be ready for a future spike or a future sting in the tail, and we are going to make preparations for exactly that.”The Fine Gael leader also predicted it will become the norm for people to opt to wear face-masks in specific situations, such as during winter months, in crowded areas, on public transport, which he said is the case in “Asian countries”.It comes as the latest Covid data released by Nphet showed another 4,821 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 had been reported in the State, while 3,772 more people had registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal. As of 8am on Friday, 591 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of whom 57 were in ICU.Targeted approachMeanwhile, the president of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, Prof Mary Horgan, who is also a member of Nphet, has said that having a targeted approach to testing and tracing is the way forward.“I think having a more targeted approach is the way forward. It’s more sustainable, but also the ability to turn on testing widely again if that is required,” she told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland on Friday.“We certainly are at a different phase of the pandemic than we were this time last year, indeed two years ago, it really is a good news day.”Prof Horgan said that “a huge amount of infrastructure and financial support” had been put into testing and tracing, and there remained the ability to upscale and downscale as necessary.The recommendation was that it would be targeted to those who are more vulnerable, people who were more likely to end up in hospital or get seriously ill from the infection, she explained.Prof Horgan added that a recommendation that people isolate if they have symptoms until the symptoms are gone remained. “The hope is that they will. If you look at what the people of Ireland have done over the past two years it’s been so good – that’s why we are where we are today and people do have an understanding of what the symptoms are, what they need to do so that they protect not only themselves, but those that they interact with in their families, in their communities and so on.”MasksThe removal of mandatory mask recommendations did not mean that people should not wear them if they felt comfortable doing so, she said.“We are adaptable, it will take a while for many people to not wear masks fully, their use in certain situations, particularly crowded situations, will be recommended. It’s the mandatory nature that’s gone.”Vulnerable people have not been abandoned, she said. “As a country we need to support those that feel they are vulnerable, we have done that with continuing testing, also they have been vaccinated. Four doses really reduces risk of hospitalisation and death by 90 per cent, it’s up to us not in vulnerable groups to support those in vulnerable groups to getting back to living life to the full.”Prof Horgan said that the mood at Thursday’s meeting of Nphet had been “very upbeat” and that in its two years “we felt we had achieved a lot”.The Covid adviser to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), Dr Mary Favier, said the decision to disband Nphet lies with the Minister for Health as the country “transitions out of a pandemic scenario”.Nphet had achieved its goals, she told RTÉ radio’s Today show. It was important that the expertise garnered during the pandemic be maintained and there was “a lot of background work” going on to ensure that the country would be prepared the next time there was a pandemic. On the issue of mandatory mask-wearing being eased, Dr Favier said there was a risk with all messages that they could be misinterpreted. Mask-wearing was a very effective means of reducing Covid numbers and she anticipated that many people would continue to wear masks.Dr Favier said she would continue to wear a mask herself in healthcare settings and in situations which were congested. That will be the same for many people, she said, as there were many who would still be anxious.That anxiety was completely understandable, she said. Many had to “reframe their lives” to deal with the risk and would continue to wear masks.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 460 reports of menstrual disturbance from vaccinated","story":"The Health Products Regulatory Authority said it had  94 reports of missing periods and 365 of heavier menstrual bleeding.  Photograph: Alan Betson More than 460 reports of menstrual disturbances in women who received a Covid-19 vaccine have been submitted to the State’s medicines regulator. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) said 94 of these related to missing periods and 365 to heavier menstrual bleeding. “In the vast majority of cases, reports were received directly from a vaccinated woman describing a menstrual disturbance with no associated medical condition,” the regulator said in its latest update on vaccine safety.Latest investigations by the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) suggest there may be “short-lived changes” in menstrual patterns, including absence of menstrual bleeding and heavier-than-usual menstrual bleeding following mRNA vaccination, the HPRA said.“This further assessment is part of routine ongoing safety monitoring, and the EMA has stated that, at this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal link between the Covid-19 vaccines and reports of changes in menstrual patterns. There is also no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines affect fertility.”The EMA has also reviewed studies of 65,000 pregnancies and found the data “reassuring”.“The review found no sign of increased risk of pregnancy complications, miscarriages, preterm births or adverse effects in the unborn babies following mRNA Covid-19 vaccination.”Suspected side-effectsMore than 1,000 reports of suspected side-effects following either a third or booster dose of Covid-19 have been received by the authority.By February 8th, 1,077 reports of suspected side-effects had been received following the administration of 2.7 million third – or booster – doses, according to its latest safety update.About one in every 2,250 children who has so far received a Covid-19 vaccine has reported a suspected side-effect, the update shows.A total of 346 reports of suspected side-effects in young people have been made after administration of the Pfizer vaccine. This related to the delivery of 780,000 doses to under-18s up to February 8th.A total of 54 of the reports related to a child – general vaccination of five to 11 year olds began last month – and the rest related to adolescents aged 12-17.Overall, the authority says, the reports received are consistent with the types of reports received for adults, with most being mild to moderate in nature. Many had resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting, it said.Weakness and chest painThe most commonly reported side-effect among children (325 reports) was “general symptoms and local reactions” such as tiredness, weakness, chest pain and feeling hot. Other significant categories were nervous system issues such dizziness, headache, fainting or feeling faint (237) and gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain (142).Overall, the HPRA has received a total of 19,468 reports of side-effects, relating to about 10.5 million administered vaccines and boosters – equivalent to one report for every 540 doses.About 40 per cent of suspected side-effects had resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting. It has received 120 reports of myocarditispericarditis and 10 reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)There have been 14 reports of anaphalaxis following a PfizerModerna vaccine and a “small number” after AstraZenecaJanssen.In 106 reports, the person was vaccinated and subsequently died. The median age of this group was 81 years.“Reports describing a death are carefully reviewed. However, it can be expected that fatalities due to progression of underlying disease or natural causes will continue to occur, including following vaccination.

The move by the Irish Province of the Order of Carmelites mirrors steps by the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin to seek zoning that would allow housing to be built on dozens of church sites in the city.In a public submission to Dublin City Council on its new development plan, the order said a 2.6-hectare site at Fortfield Road was surplus to its requirements for education and could be developed for housing. The site is between Terenure and Templeogue villages. Any income generated from future development would be used to finance school building and repair, as well as supporting the school’s ethos and the “charitable work and needs” of the Carmelites in Ireland and abroad. Junior school closureThe push to rezone such lands for housing follows the 2018 closure of the private Terenure College Junior School. The fee-paying Terenure College secondary school at the site has 740 students. The submission said there was no intention to increase the number of students beyond that number, nor was there “any significant need in the locality” for additional places in the school.The Carmelites said the development of housing would have “no adverse impact on the operations of the school”, adding that it would be left with an area of 19.7 hectares, including a lake and adjoining woodland, which could be offered as a formal public open space if residential development was brought forward. “The lands north and northwest of the college are no longer required or used for institutional use and there are more than adequate grounds available for sports associated with the college,” stated the submission to the council for the order by planning consultants John Spain Associates.‘Sustainable development’The 38-page report backing up the submission states that the council’s proposal to tighten the zoning rules governing sites such as the school lands would have a “severe and damaging effect on the proper planning and sustainable development” of the property,The archdiocese made similar arguments, in its separate submission, against the proposed zoning change, which precludes housing or office developments in all but “highly exceptional” circumstances.The order said the application of such restrictions “would result in far more lands being reserved for the school than any other school within the county whether considered on a per-student or per-school basis”. The submission said it was apparent that the school was “very generously served by the institutional lands” on which they sit. “The current and future needs of the school and the local community can be comfortably met on the remaining lands.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"hong kong not allowed to live with covid but can t stop it either","story":"People sleep in hospital beds  outside the Caritas Medical Centre in Hong Kong as hospitals become overwhelmed with the coronavirus wave. Photograph: Peter ParksAFP via Getty ImagesThe scenes were straight out of China’s coronavirus playbook. Armies of workers, deployed to lock down residents. Plans to erect a massive makeshift hospital. And on Wednesday, a command from Xi Jinping, the country’s top leader, plastered across local front pages: “Make controlling the epidemic as soon as possible an overwhelming priority.”The site of the latest outbreak, though, was not mainland China, but neighbouring Hong Kong. And unlike on the mainland, where the government’s lofty language has been followed by quick results, no such relief is in sight.As Hong Kong sinks under its worst wave yet of coronavirus, overwhelmed hospitals have left patients waiting on pavements. People have stood in testing lines that wind across parks and soccer fields. Cases are still growing exponentially, as officials opt for targeted lockdowns rather than a citywide one.Researchers have warned that by summer the latest wave could kill nearly 1,000 people – more than four times the number that have died of Covid in Hong Kong over the past two years.The city’s flailing response has exposed a crucial weakness in its ability to handle coronavirus. Unlike other places facing a surge of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, cannot choose to live with the virus Beijing continues to demand local elimination. But the city, which retains certain freedoms unheard-of in the mainland, also cannot wield Beijing’s full authoritarian tool kit or nearly unlimited manpower to stamp out transmission at any cost.‘Dynamic zero’Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has struggled even to define the term that the government uses to describe its approach, “dynamic zero”. “‘Dynamic zero’ – I admit this is a policy requirement of the mainland,” she told reporters last month. “But I am not the initiator, so if you want an authoritative definition of ‘dynamic’, I’m sorry, I really can’t explain it.”At its core, the city’s crisis reflects the limitations of its unique political model. Health experts have pointed out that certain measures, such as citywide mandatory testing, would be impractical in Hong Kong, and could also stir anger in a public already deeply distrustful of the government.But as Beijing exerts ever-tighter control over Hong Kong, through a national security law and sweeping crackdown on dissent, those considerations may start to carry less weight.Some have called Hong Kong’s willingness to embrace tougher restrictions a proxy for its loyalty to Beijing. “The loopholes and oscillation in Hong Kong’s antivirus strategy show that some officials have not met the requirements for ‘firm patriotism’, said Tian Feilong, a law professor at Beijing’s Beihang University who studies Hong Kong.Last month, the Hong Kong government was forced to clarify that it was legal to make “general remarks and discussion” about the effectiveness of dynamic zero, after Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, suggested that questioning it could violate the security law.Meanwhile, the public health toll continues to grow. Some 12,000 people who have tested positive are still waiting to be admitted to a hospital or isolation unit, according to government figures. After five months with no Covid deaths, Hong Kong has recorded at least 21 over the past week, including a 3-year-old girl and a 100-year-old woman on Tuesday.Early successesUntil this wave, Hong Kong kept coronavirus largely in check. The city’s combination of tight social distancing rules and aggressive contact tracing meant that the previous four waves of infection were curbed relatively quickly. For much of 2021, the city recorded no local cases. But the highly transmissible Omicron variant assaulted the cracks in the city’s defences.The first local Omicron transmissions were traced to two flight attendants who returned from abroad in December. A bigger Omicron cluster was connected to a woman who was infected while in hotel quarantine after returning from Pakistan. The woman passed the virus to her husband, who spread it to a cleaner at a vast housing development.Hong Kong locked down a half-dozen buildings and tested 37,000 people last month after more than 100 people there tested positive. The virus has now spread to more than 20 senior homes and care facilities, highlighting another weakness in Hong Kong’s preparations. While more than 84 per cent of people over age 11 have had at least one shot of a vaccine, among those 70 and older, the proportion is just 56 per cent.“In a way we were a victim of our own success because the fatality rate and the infection rate were pretty good until recently,” said Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who was speaking by phone from self-quarantine after her driver tested positive. “Older people thought they didn’t need to be vaccinated because there could be complications. And the government was hesitant. We have avoided vaccine mandates.”As the outbreak grew, Lam at first tried to draw a clear line between Hong Kong and the mainland, even as she pledged to adhere to dynamic zero. It would be impractical to invite mainland workers to carry out door-to-door testing, she said this month, in part because of language differences the primary language in Hong Kong is Cantonese, not the Mandarin used in the mainland. Lam also rejected calls from pro-Beijing lawmakers to introduce mandatory universal testing, defending the more targeted operations.“If we give up this effective, focused testing work and rashly follow other places to conduct so-called community testing, I will not bear the consequences,” she said. “Anti-epidemic work is not a slogan.”“The Hong Kong government just follows instructions from Beijing, but they are still hesitant to go full throttle, to go all the way,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “They know that most people in Hong Kong don’t trust the Chinese way of doing things.”Political pressureBut in recent weeks, as the outbreak has spiralled out of control, calls for Hong Kong to draw closer to the mainland strategy have grown. China’s state news agency and official Communist Party mouthpiece both published commentaries this month warning against any suggestion of living with the virus.The political pressure, coupled with the deteriorating public health situation, seems to have had an effect. Over the weekend, Hong Kong officials travelled to Shenzhen, across the border, to set up joint task forces with officials there. The task forces will work to increase testing capacity and build makeshift isolation facilities, like the ones used in China, the government said.On Wednesday, Beijing announced that it would also assign central government officials, in addition to the regional ones, to help oversee Hong Kong’s outbreak. But even pro-Beijing figures acknowledge that Hong Kong cannot copy the mainland model outright.When authorities this month locked down Baise, a city of about 3.6 million in southwestern China, after a flare-up of several dozen cases, they deployed 38,000 Communist Party members and workers to patrol neighbourhoods and coordinate supplies, according to the local government. Such networks are a longstanding part of the mainland’s social controls. Hong Kong has more than twice as many residents and no such network.“We lack enough organisation, mobilisation and control capabilities, and we also lack a strong government,” said Lau Siu-Kai, an adviser to Beijing in Hong Kong.Hong Kongers could also prove fiercely resistant to a citywide lockdown. When Lam visited a locked-down housing estate last month, residents showered her with insults from their windows – a display of public dissent rarely seen since the imposition of the security law.The government has hesitated to introduce more invasive contact tracing apps such as exist in the mainland, in part because of residents’ privacy concerns. But some worry that authorities will use the latest outbreak as an opportunity to push through more surveillance measures, Willy Lam, the professor, said. Trust in the Hong Kong and Beijing governments “is quite low”, he said.Health experts say the political debate has overshadowed the grim medical reality. Between low vaccination rates among older people and the slowness to impose lockdowns, the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, no matter what path Hong Kong adopts, said Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.“Hong Kong is moving too late,” he said. “We don’t have any good options.” – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"neutrality does not require relinquishing our capacity for self defence","story":"The mass build-up of troops by Russia on Ukraine’s borders and implied threat of invasion in recent weeks brought clarity to Europe’s security situation.It has also made clear some understandings and misconceptions in Ireland about defence.You’ve reached an article that is only available to  subscribers.Subscribe today and get the full picture for just €1 for the first month."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hms queen elizabeth inside aircraft carrier royal navy flagship","story":"The yellow-helmeted flight deck officer leans into a 40-knot wind and raises a small green flag in his right hand. I crouch behind him, clutching my robust but battered high-def camera. A few feet away, a snarling F-35B Lightning Stealth Fighter, sleek as a shark and every bit as lethal, prepares to launch into the steel-grey skies of the eastern Mediterranean.On the bridge, the navigators steer directly into the wind. ‘Steady on designated flying course, one-one-zero,’ says the officer of the watch.  ‘Steady on one-one-zero, sir,’ confirms the helmsman.The F-35B needs plenty of headwind to get airborne. The aircraft has a run-up of only 350 feet to the curved ‘ski-jump’, from which it will make its final leap skywards. Inside the glass-encased flight control tower behind us, the vessel’s Commander Air, Ed Phillips, aka ‘Wings’, looks up and down the massive flight deck and, when satisfied all is clear, gives a short sharp order:All eyes turn to the green flag held aloft and rippling in the wind. Probably worth no more than a couple of quid, it is brought down to the ground with a dramatic flourish the signal for the F-35B, worth well over £100 million, to get airborne.I brace myself for the immense power about to be unleashed. I’ve witnessed this many times and know what to expect. It’ll be exhilarating, for sure, but also terrifying and probably painful. I’m determined to capture on film a spectacular close-up of a launch as near to the aircraft as possible, but the timing is critical and so far I’ve manifestly failed to pull it off.The searing blast from the rear jet nozzle has always blown me off my feet and sent me sprawling. I have the bruises and cuts to show for it and God knows how much skin I’ve now invested in the roughened, diamond-hard surface of the flight deck. But I still don’t have the footage I want. This time, two hefty sailors are ready to hold me down, or at least try to. My fear is that no amount of muscle power will be a match for the explosive thrust of what is essentially a horizontal rocket.The pilot releases the brakes and opens the throttle. The Pratt \u0026amp Whitney afterburning, turbofan engine raises its pitch to a terrifying scream as the aircraft surges forward. I clench my teeth, tense my muscles and, with my heart pounding in my ears, bear hug the camera in a semi-stable position. But how long can I hold on? Four vice-like hands press down on my hunched shoulders.It’s June 2021 and I’ve joined the ship’s company of HMS Queen Elizabeth for her first operational deployment. We are some weeks into a seven-month voyage to the South China Sea, not on exercise but, locked, loaded and ready for action, should it become necessary.The new carrier and fleet flagship, together with eight escorts (destroyers, frigates, supply ships and a submarine) comprise Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) – the most powerful naval force to leave the UK in a generation. Prior to our transit through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, on our way to the Pacific and the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the ship has been launching waves of jets on Operation Shader – in support of land forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. But this has prompted a reaction from the Russians. They consider this part of the Med their own backyard and are intent on letting the QE and her escorts know they’re not welcome here. But the QE is the new dog on the block and she’s here to mark her own territory, not with a wag of the tail but a snarl.Today’s launch of the F-35s, therefore, is not to attack IS but to ward off Russian warplanes attempting to overfly us. Pilots, drawn from the Fleet Air Arm, RAF and US Marine Corps, have been scrambling all day, sometimes in rapid two-minute intervals, to intercept ‘red bandits’ and escort them away at a safe range.The Russians, apart from wanting to goad the Royal Navy, are desperate to get a closer look at the QE, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the world, and also test the Task Group’s reaction procedures – not only in the air but also on the surface, with their warships, and underwater with their submarines. The QE’s Anti-Submarine Warfare Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron are on constant patrol in order to monitor subsurface incursions and react accordingly. Nobody has actually opened fire, but there’s a lot of posturing and tactical lip-curling. If this is the start of a new Cold War, nobody is in doubt that things could heat up very quickly. The QE’s magazines are bursting with bombs, bullets and missiles of all descriptions and capabilities, as you’d expect on a warship that is now Britain’s main conventional strategic deterrent.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, leading CSG21, knows that Britain’s potential adversaries, the Russians and Chinese, will prod and poke his Task Group at every opportunity. ‘They want to see what we’re made of,’ he freely admits. ‘And I’m happy to show them, but professionally, in a spirit of confidence, not confrontation.’ Moorhouse is a steely commander but also a diplomat by default. After all, HMS Queen Elizabeth, a chunk of British sovereign territory, is part warship, part floating embassy. As the embodiment of ‘Global Britain’, her charge is to deliver ‘power projection’ on behalf of the nation: on the one hand that means hard-edged, lethal warfare on the other it’s about soft, political persuasion through deterrence, as well as overt support for allies around the world.Friends and foes alike will be watching this deployment with keen interest and I’m here to capture it on film for a forthcoming BBC TV series. But this isn’t the first time I’ve filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth. That was back in 2009, when I witnessed Princess Anne cutting the ship’s first steel at Govan shipyard in Glasgow. This was not so much the birth of Britain’s biggest-ever warship – more like her conception – and I was struck by the enormity of the occasion.  Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord at the time, spoke with passion to the audience and assembled media. The Queen Elizabeth Class of aircraft carrier, comprising HMS Queen Elizabeth, with HMS Prince of Wales to follow, would, he explained, ‘provide Britain with the means to deliver air power from the sea, wherever and whenever required, and in a stronger and more decisive form than ever before’. They will also, he added, ‘be the centrepiece of Britain’s military capability for many years to come’.The construction of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship meant a complete reinvention of the Royal Navy but, despite Sir Jonathon’s upbeat messaging, it was to prove a painful and long-drawn-out process. Our active carriers at the time, Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible, were about to be axed in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and with them the Navy’s Harrier squadron – its entire naval fixed-wing capability. Already, naysayers and vocal critics were provoking a heated debate over the pros and cons of a carrier-centric Navy, and whether there’d be enough escort ships to protect the carriers while at sea or sufficient sailors to man them – each would be three times the size of the Invincible Class carriers.General Sir Peter Wall, former head of the British Army, described the decision to build the new carriers as no more than a ‘vanity project’ that ‘lacked credibility’ and which could be seen to have ‘skewed the UK’s conventional defence effort to a damaging degree’. Max Hastings, ever the provocateur, suggested the new warships represented delusions of grandeur for a Navy in decline. Other denigrators were quick to point out that a large carrier is a big target – especially for the new generation of hypersonic missiles that the Chinese call ‘carrier killers’.Russia inevitably chimed in with some of its own political trash talk: ‘Just make sure you keep your new carrier away from Moscow’s warships or they’ll send it to the bottom of the sea.’Military hardware is an emotive subject, especially in the context of huge capital expenditure that might otherwise be spent on housing, welfare or the NHS, but £6 billion for two vessels (albeit a near doubling of the original budget) is modest compared to the eye-watering price tag of USS Gerald R. Ford, an American super-carrier of similar proportions which cost more than $13 billion (and which, according to the Pentagon, ‘has yet to demonstrate it can effectively defend itself from anti-ship missiles and other threats’).The glossy brochure issued by a conglomerate of shipbuilders known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance certainly suggested that Britain was getting its money’s worth. At 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales would not only be the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, but also the most powerful and advanced in terms of military technology and stealth capabilities – especially when married eventually to the state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning jet fighter.The sales pitch for the super-carriers came with a staggering array of facts and figures. The ships, it claimed, would be so highly automated they’d require only ‘lean-manned’ crews – less than 1,000 per ship, without aircrew. That’s broadly one fifth the size of an American crew on a similar-sized ship. They’d each have a four-acre flight deck, the size of three and a half football fields, nine decks and a hangar big enough to fit two Type 23 frigates side by side. Each carrier would have two propellers weighing 33 tonnes – exerting the same thrust as 50 high-speed trains and producing a maximum speed in excess of 27 knots (31mph). The six engines (two mighty gas turbines and four diesels) would produce enough energy to power a city the size of Swindon the electrical cabling and wiring would stretch six times round the world the ship, weighing the same as 35,000 family cars, would carry enough fuel to take those cars to the moon and back a dozen times… and on it went.The statistics were mind-boggling, but one thing was for sure: the challenge of building the first of these ships – the nine-decked HMS Queen Elizabeth – manning her, taking her to sea and getting her battle-ready was going to be a compelling story, as I learnt while following her construction in seven shipyards around the UK, culminating in her final assembly at Rosyth in Fife, like some gargantuan Lego toy. But, engineering aside, I knew that her real story would reside in the sailors yet to arrive the men and women who would breathe life into the country’s first super-carrier.  Foremost among them was Jerry Kyd, the ship’s first seagoing captain. I encountered him on the day he arrived in Rosyth in May 2016, as he addressed a fledgling ship’s company of just 456 sailors standing in front of their ship, still an inert hulk without propellers and dead in the water.‘The world’s a frisky place at the moment,’ he said. ‘And we have to be ready to respond to threats which I think are coming sooner rather than later.’ Kyd glanced towards their future home, encased in scaffolding. ‘HMS Queen Elizabeth, as big and sophisticated as she might be, is really just a huge metal box, full of pipes, wires, gadgetry and computer terminals. She’s missing one vital ingredient…’ He paused dramatically. ‘Without the flesh, blood, muscle and hearts of you, my sailors, that ship is just a robot. You, not the ship, are the most important resource at my disposal.’It was nearly a year before the QE was ready for her first sea trials. As a ‘new build’, there were bound to be problems. On the eve of our departure for the North Sea, Captain Kyd warned that there would be emergencies: ‘We’ll have floods, we’ll have fires. And casualties too. That’s the nature of this business.’For the best part of two months the ship was put through her paces off the coast of Scotland, where I joined them. The first aircraft, a Merlin helicopter, was landed on the flight deck within four days as the ship’s company got used to their largely subterranean existence deep in the belly of the beast. I watched with amazement as the sailors, many of them straight out of training, transformed the massive grey hulk not only into a working warship but a home from home. The QE was fast becoming a vibrant floating city and, with 23 nations represented from across the Commonwealth, all human life was here. My first challenge, however, was to learn my way round a ship longer than the Houses of Parliament and taller than Nelson’s Column and so gigantic that it boasted five kilometres of passageways and 3,200 compartments.Apart from a serious issue with a cracked thrust block that held one of the drive shafts in place, all went as well as could be expected. As Jerry Kyd foretold, there were plenty of fires and floods as the ship was pushed to breaking point so that her technical and seagoing limits could be identified. There were ‘casualties’ too, but thankfully only minor ones – the worst being cracked teeth and broken fingers. Sea trials completed, we finally entered Portsmouth dockyard, the ship’s designated home port, and within months the QE was officially commissioned by the Queen.After a period of maintenance, the ship set off for the next vital stage of her trials off the eastern seaboard of the US. Within hours of leaving Portsmouth we became aware of an ominous presence – a Russian Federation frigate called Admiral Makarov had closed to within two miles of our position. A highly capable warship armed with Kalibr long-range cruise missiles, the Makarov was in transit from the Baltic to Sevastopol on the Black Sea. While officially permitted to route through the English Channel she had clearly erted her course to have a closer look at our ship.  A few days later, just before starting our transatlantic crossing, we were suddenly erted into the Irish Sea to help chase off a Russian submarine spotted in British territorial waters. There was an increasing concern, as there still is, that Russians could be sussing out British underwater power and communication cabling – an obvious target for a potential enemy.  The Russian sub made a run for it as soon as we got close. Even before the QE had become operational the writing was on the wall and it was written very clearly in Cyrillic script. A sign of things to come (and indeed I write this as the world tries to second-guess Russian designs on Ukraine).Following this brief ersion we progressed across the Atlantic and the next dramatic event I witnessed was the ship’s first-ever run ashore in a foreign port, which didn’t go entirely to plan. In Mayport, Florida, after a night of heavy drinking, four sailors from the QE and two from our escort frigate, HMS Monmouth, were arrested for a range of alcohol-related offences including jaywalking, fighting and resisting arrest. Despite making headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, the episode was soon forgotten and at least part of the blame was attached to overzealous policing.  Captain Kyd, a pragmatist, reckoned that a night in jail was punishment enough for sailors letting off steam. ‘The question we have to ask ourselves,’ Kyd told his commanders, ‘is what sort of sailor would we want to go to war with? The automaton who obeys every rule, plays it safe and never takes chances? Or the free spirit who pushes his luck and breaks the odd rule?’    Kyd quickly refocused on the job in hand – namely to see an F-35B Lightning jet land on the ship’s flight deck for the first time. Helicopters were one thing, but a fighter jet that lands vertically using immense downward thrust from its enormous engine was quite another. Commander Nathan Gray, the Navy’s top test pilot, was the first to attempt a landing. It went without a hitch, although many questions remained about safety margins before the flight deck and aircraft could be handed over to front-line combat pilots. Two months of continuous, painstaking testing in all weathers, including a full-blown hurricane, gradually provided the answers. Gray, despite a few near misses, was satisfied that he and his colleagues had done all they could to ready the ship and aircraft for action.  And so to the present. Here I am aboard the QE once again – no longer on sea trials, but busy arm-wrestling the Russians, and before long she’ll be playing cat-and-mouse with the Chinese in the South China Sea. This is the acid test, with much at stake. The Prime Minister has declared he wants the Royal Navy to be the most powerful and influential in Europe by the end of the decade. CSG21 is the first step to achieving that ambition and proving that the new aircraft carrier is no white elephant but an effective instrument of government as well as an iconic symbol of nation.  Great adventure beckons and, once again, all life is here – a much expanded ship’s company of 1,650 men and women. Yes, there are the aviators yes, there are the seafarers yes, there are the marine engineers. But there are so many others: stewards, chefs, medics, gunners, aircraft handlers, writers, warfare specialists, physical trainers and intelligence officers. There is even a specialist chocolatier and, maybe because of him, a dedicated dentist and dental hygienist.‘Bleeding frozen chips!’ shouts Ronnie Lambert, an Essex boy, born and bred. ‘They want 10 more boxes in the main galley and they’re all at the back of the frickin’ fridge.’‘Well, get in there and pull ’em out,’ laughs fellow storeman Aaron Mackin. ‘It’s yer bleedin’ job.’‘Well, I’m transferring to aviation! Them boys have it easy up there. All sunshine and sea.’    The F-35B, accelerating from a standing start, rattles my bones. The heavyset sailors push down hard on my prone body as I attempt to point the camera in the right direction. The sailors are now lying on top of me – the jet stream strikes and skittles us. I roll across the deck, trying to protect my camera. Did I capture the moment of take off? I will check as soon as I can. Lying on my back I look up to see five British F-35s close in on three Russian MiGs.There will be more Russian warplanes soon. They’ll keep coming, but at least we know one thing: we have chips to go with our fish tonight. Must be a Friday.More from NewsStorm Eunice latest: London Fire Brigade declares major incident over deluge of 999 calls Russia-Ukraine crisis: Separatists call for men to \u0026#39stand up\u0026#39 and fight after ordering evacuation\u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 suspects allowed to see evidence before responding to policeBritain in the eye of Storm Eunice: Power station tower collapses as winds peak \u0026#39Liberals\u0026#39 are conspicuously silent on Canada\u0026#39s descent into tyrannyWhen will the woke crowd address the history of slavery in Africa?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris make nick clegg one powerful men britain","story":"When they first stood together in the Rose Garden of Downing Street, few would have guessed where David Cameron and Nick Clegg would ultimately end up. The former prime minister has slipped into obscurity: mocked, ignored and having virtually no place in public debate. But his erstwhile deputy is now enthroned in Silicon Valley as global affairs chief of Facebook. He’s one of the most powerful men in the world – and I wish that was an exaggeration.Murdoch, Hearst, Beaverbrook: none exercised as much power over the world’s news as Clegg is now capable of doing. After the broadcasters, Facebook is Britain’s number one source of news. Its users may think they’re just seeing what they selected – based on who they follow, what they share. But what they actually get is a selection, chosen by algorithms under criteria programmed by Silicon Valley workers. All overseen by the likes of Clegg. In this way, Facebook can edit the way tens of millions see the world.The power that all this gives to Silicon Valley is matched only by the utter ignorance in government about its nature and implications. And that’s why Boris Johnson is unwittingly about to give Clegg – and all the Big Tech firms – more power than ever. In a cackhanded attempt to bring them all to heel, the Online Safety Bill will transform Big Tech into our new censors. They’ll obey government orders on a certain number of things, but in return they get the power – nay, duty – to police the rest pretty much as they see fit.The original idea is sensible: to tackle pornography, criminality, content encouraging suicide: in other words, genuine online filth. But how to do this in a country with free speech rules? The Online Safety Bill invents a new category – “legal, but harmful” – with fines imposed on any digital publisher that crosses this vaguely drawn line. The danger, of course, lies in the grey areas. What about articles questioning vaccine policy – are they “harmful”? Or Jimmy Carr’s gypsy jokes? Facebook won’t want to be fined or take the risk. The bots will be told: if in doubt, strike it out.Consequences can be seen already, with government critics first going digitally missing. The Socialist Workers Party found its Facebook page vapourised. Novara Media, an upstart socialist broadcaster, had its YouTube page taken down. In both cases, services were resumed after an uproar over-zealous censorship bots were blamed. But this draws attention to something we were never really told: that such bots already are at work, trawling cyberspace, identifying troublemakers and closing them down.Clegg has never cared much about free speech. As deputy prime minister, he tried to force newspapers to submit to government regulation, but his job now is to maximise Facebook’s profits. It makes money by showing adverts, with “likes”, “shares” and Baby Shark videos: unlike the media moguls, Silicon Valley doesn’t care about news. It has no interest in defending minority voices. Its general approach is: we’ll do anything, just don’t fine us! In fact, we can be your censors! Look how well we’d do it!The Covid era saw Silicon Valley demonstrating just how effective a censor it can be. Facebook boasted that it was “working with government” to combat “misinformation” – which it seemed to define as stories unhelpful to No 10. As a viewer, you won’t miss what you don’t see. But editors like me (even The Spectator swims in a digital sea) soon find out which articles the censor bots dislike. For example, if our weekly YouTube show had criticism of lockdown policy, that episode might have mysteriously fewer viewers – probably because it’s withheld from YouTube’s all-powerful recommendation system. But we’re never told. Sometimes, an episode is deleted entirely.Articles, too, are judged harshly. During the debate about face masks, I commissioned an in-depth report from two academics, both experts in their field: they found the evidence unconvincing. The bots hated it and Facebook slapped a “false information” warning on it. I asked Facebook to identify a single error in the article. No response. It’s Facebook: it doesn’t have to respond. I wish I could say it doesn’t matter, but social media drives about a third of our website traffic (and, ergo, our sales). So yes, it matters.The British Medical Journal watched all this, thinking (rightly, as it turned out) that it would be next. In an editorial, it highlighted the risk this posed to basic scientific debate. “It seems 2020 is Orwell’s 1984, where the boundaries of public discourse are governed by multibillion dollar corporations (in place of a totalitarian regime),” it wrote. “And secret algorithms coded by unidentified employees.” Except we know the identity of one of the bosses: Sir Nick Clegg. And he’s about to be the new Big Brother. Quite a thought.Clegg himself is unlikely to delete Boris Johnson’s account (as Twitter did to Donald Trump) but Facebook could, if it wanted. This raises a question: should he have so much power? More to the point, should Clegg’s colleagues in San Francisco be deciding what Brits should be reading? Why can’t we see the criteria, or the decisions? Might we end up with the Left-wards bias, seen time and time again in social media in America?Reports of Covid leaking from a Wuhan lab were once seen, by Facebook, as fake news – and removed. Now they look all too plausible. The nature, power and influence of censorship bots is something that politicians struggle to imagine, let alone regulate. The BBC presents an easier, juicer, more understandable target. When the Online Safety Bill was introduced in Parliament, not a single MP asked about bots or speech protection. “My colleagues can’t see that this Bill would make us more exposed than ever to the wokeward drift of Silicon Valley,” says one minister. “It may soon be too late”.Boris Johnson has been pressing “pause” on a few policies of late, and the Online Safety Bill is the biggest disaster waiting to happen. In the four years that this Bill has been in the making, it has been rendered out of date because the dynamics of digital media and public debate have changed so much. If he goes ahead now, it would cement Clegg’s status as the most powerful Englishman in world media. There’s still time to stop, take stock and think of a better way.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Separatists call for men to \u0026#39stand up\u0026#39 and fight after ordering evacuationStorm Eunice latest: London Fire Brigade declares major incident over deluge of 999 calls \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 suspects allowed to see evidence before responding to policeBritain in the eye of Storm Eunice: Power station tower collapses as winds peak \u0026#39Liberals\u0026#39 are conspicuously silent on Canada\u0026#39s descent into tyrannyWhen will the woke crowd address the history of slavery in Africa?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"liberals conspicuously silent canadas descent tyranny","story":"The F word gets thrown around a lot these days. Right-wing politicians get milkshaked for being “fascists” and opponents of critical-race theory are said to be enabling fascism by questioning white privilege - you’re definitely a fascist if you think biological sex is real. When it comes to Trump, commentators are more liberal with the F-word than a market full of fish wives. After the January Capital Riots last year, one columnist wondered, “if Trump looks like a fascist and acts like a fascist, then maybe he is one”.But as real, material authoritarianism raises its head in Canada, many of those same laptop bombardiers keen to call out fascism wherever they see it seem conspicuously silent. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau might not exactly be Mussolini, but his decision to invoke the Emergencies Act against protesters in the nation’s capital is a watershed moment. With these new powers, Trudeau is effectively able to wage war on thousands of truckers and supporters camped out in Ottawa.Deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland smiled and chuckled as she told reporters that the law change allowed banks to freeze the accounts of protesters without any need for a court order, adding that vehicle insurance for anyone involved in the convoy could also be suspended. The interim police chief in Ottawa told a press conference last night that the police were working with social services to “remove” children from the area - as many of the truckers are accompanied by their families (pictures of trucker-installed bouncy castles and play areas were circulating over the weekend). In short, the Canadian government has granted itself the power to strip citizens of their money, their transport and their kids. Several organisers have been arrested, despite the fact that bar a few fringe incidents, the vast majority of the thousands-strong convoy has maintained a peaceful (if disruptive) approach to getting their voices heard.Just imagine the uproar that would ensue if Trump had taken children from Black Lives Matters protesters who took to the streets after the murder of George Floyd, or Boris Johnson had used the banks to starve out the costumed climate-changer obsessives who took over Trafalgar Square before the pandemic. You don’t even have to imagine it - when visiting Kenosha amid the riots and protests of 2020, Trump said “these are not acts of peaceful protest but really domestic terror”. In response, CNN ran analysis which argued that Trump’s naming of protesters who disagree with him as terrorists “puts him in the company of the world\u0027s autocrats”. The T word might not have spilled out of Trudeau’s mouth just yet, but his use of the Emergencies Act (last invoked by his father 50 years ago to combat a real terrorist threat) allows his government to broaden the Terrorist Financing Act, shutting down the fundraising sites used by the truckers’ “Freedom Convoy”.But while the silence surrounding Trudeau’s new measures is startling, his reach for such spectacularly authoritarian measures is no surprise. Trudeau’s political career has been defined by superficial and self-serving PR moves. From taking the knee and whipping himself in public to atone for his past sins of blackface to stumbling over the latest LGBTQ2 acronym to prove his commitment to gender ideology, the thing that Trudeau cares most about is his popularity within international bourgeois identity politics. Having gained online applause for labelling the truckers guilty of “antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Black racism, homophobia, and transphobia”, Trudeau is attempting to turn a populist revolt against vaccine mandates, endangered livelihoods and coronavirus regulations into a Punch-and-Judy culture war between the enlightened prime minister and a bigoted rabble who should know better. Many of those on the Freedom Convoy are truckers who worked throughout the pandemic - as it happens, many are vaccinated and argue that they followed restrictions at the time - who continued to cart around the goods and resources that Canadian society needed to stay afloat. Thanks to isolation and social distancing rules, many faced a lonely journey without rest stops or access to amenities that make the work of trucking bearable. Conversely many of those now labelling them fascist had the luxury of sitting at home waiting for their deliveries to arrive.Like the gilets-jaunes\u0027 challenge to French green taxes and energy prices, or Brexit disrupting the status quo for the European elite, the trucker protest is making all the right people uncomfortable. No stranger to the F-word, Paul Mason’s latest article not only described the truckers as “21st-century fascism”, but challenged the Canadian government to “arm itself”. Whether or not you agree with the truckers’ aims, the hysterical response from Trudeau and his so-called liberal cheerleaders is the real threat to democracy.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Separatists call for men to \u0026#39stand up\u0026#39 and fight after ordering evacuationStorm Eunice latest: London Fire Brigade declares major incident over deluge of 999 calls \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 suspects allowed to see evidence before responding to policeBritain in the eye of Storm Eunice: Power station tower collapses as winds peak When will the woke crowd address the history of slavery in Africa?Explained: Why Russia might invade Ukraine and what could happen nextMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"storm eunice storm dudley pictures havoc strong winds batter","story":"Storm Eunice has struck the UK and brought England\u0027s highest ever recorded gust of wind of 122mph on the Isle of Wight. Thousands of homes are without power and the transport network is in chaos as train services, flights and ferry crossings have been cancelled. Kent.

Earlier this month, the Prime Minister announced that he was bringing forward the date at which the remaining legal restrictions would end. The NHS has not faced, as some had feared, an unsustainable wave of omicron admissions this winter. Thanks, in part, to the success of the booster programme, the UK has remained relatively free, certainly when compared to some European countries.There is a risk, however, that the formal end of the last legal measures will not result in a full return to normality. There is a debate, for example, about the continued provision of “free” tests to the population, with the Labour leader saying that ending the policy would be a mistake. But it is becoming harder and harder to justify the huge sums of public money spent on this initiative. We do not spend billions of pounds testing for flu, so why should we do so for Covid, especially now that the vast majority of the population has been vaccinated? All it arguably encourages is unwarranted paranoia about the coronavirus.Then there is the continued risk aversion of some local authorities, schools and hospital trusts. Already, some public sector leaders have made it clear that they intend to keep some protocols in place for longer – seen, for example, in Sadiq Khan’s insistence that masks be worn on the Tube. This cannot be allowed to continue. The point of living with Covid is that iniduals should make their own minds up about the level of risk they are prepared to accept. That is impossible if arms of the state still feel entitled to tell people what to do.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Separatists call for men to \u0026#39stand up\u0026#39 and fight after ordering evacuationStorm Eunice latest: London Fire Brigade declares major incident over deluge of 999 calls \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 suspects allowed to see evidence before responding to policeBritain in the eye of Storm Eunice: Power station tower collapses as winds peak \u0026#39Liberals\u0026#39 are conspicuously silent on Canada\u0026#39s descent into tyrannyWhen will the woke crowd address the history of slavery in Africa?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dwp universal credit sanctions soar","story":"Exclusive: DWP Universal Credit sanctions soar to , a month in extremely worrying riseThe number of sanctions has shot from a few thousand a month to , - a similar proportion to before the pandemic - after the DWP brought back face-to-face Jobcentre appointments.

The shocking rise comes as millions of people are hit by rising living costs, with energy bills, National Insurance and inflation all surging this Spring while benefits rise by only .%.Sanctions were suspended in the first Covid lockdown, and remained low at first after being restored in summer . But they have soared since the Department for Work and Pensionsbrought back face-to-face Jobcentre appointments last April, with people who miss a session having their benefits cut or stopped.The number of Universal Credit claimants with a sanction rose from , in June  to , in November , the most recent month available. Scroll down for the full figures and join the debate in the comments. Have you received an unfair sanction  Tell us on webnews@mirror. The total number of people sanctioned across the whole month will be higher than the official figures, as they are taken on a particular day each month. The data also excludes Universal Credit claimants who are not in ‘conditionality’ groups, such as severely disabled people.And Tory ministers are now introducing even tighter rules, with claimants facing a sanction after four weeksthey refuse a job outside their chosen field, which could push sanctions higher. Anti-austerity activist Charlotte Hughes warned it was “extremely worrying as we face a huge cost of living crisis putting energy and food prices up”.  She added: “Sanctions are a cruel and unnecessary tool to use against those that are already poor and living in poverty. “Benefit sanctions ensure a person or a family are dragged further into poverty, making them have to choose whether they can eat or heat for the duration of their sanction.“Sanctioning claimants creates a never ending circle of poverty and does not encourage anyone to look for more work.” Dr David Webster of the University of Glasgow, who has researched the impact of sanctions for years, said: “The impact of a sanction often lasts a long time. “If it causes a crisis in the family, orit leads to somebody being evicted, the effects are pretty long-lasting. “Sanctions drive people further into debt, because obviously people can’t stop spending money altogether – they have to find something to eat and so on. “They have to keep spending money, somoney isn’t coming in they’re going to have to borrow it, and they get further in debt. “That has damaging effects on their mental health, because there’s all the anxiety and stress. And for a minority of people there’s obviously the question of potential eviction.”  The sharp rise comes even as the overall number of Universal Credit claimants has fallen with the reopening of the economy. DWP figures this week show .% of claimants were subject to a sanction in November, a similar proportion to before the pandemic. That is up from .% in October and .% in September. “If you look at the trend, there’s really virtually no slackening in the pace of increase in that percentage – it’s heading skywards,” said Dr Webster. The DWP’s recently announced Way to Work scheme will soon force claimants to look for jobs outside their chosen field after just four weeks on Universal Credit. A DWP spokesperson said: “With a record number of jobs available, it’s right that people who can work are encouraged to take up suitable roles through our Way to Work scheme. As well as being good for mental wellbeing, people are at least £, better off in full time work than on benefits. “People are only sanctionedthey fail, without good reason, to meet the conditions which they agreed to, and the latest data shows the sanctions rate remains below pre-pandemic levels.”Sanctions by month Figure is the number of people on the Universal Credit full service receiving a sanction on the second Thursday of each month.

The Lib Dems have tabled an Early Day Motion to release “all accompanying evidence” on gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall, “including photographs”.Top civil servant Sue Gray gathered around  images and passed them to police, who are investigating  Westminster parties during lockdown. However, sources have said she is not set to publish the images, which it’s thought could include CCTV stills, when she produces a second report. And this week it emerged the Cabinet Office Liaison Unit has asked the Met Police to confirm it will not publish photos either, as part of its investigation. The Lib Dem motion would use the mechanism of a “humble address” to order a “full, unreacted report of the Cabinet Office” investigation to be published.  The government would also have to give “a full list of the names of any elected officials, senior civil servants, and political appointees” who are fined by police.This comes after the police and government suggested anyone who is fined will not be named, with Brits having to rely on Boris Johnson naming himself.But it is only an Early Day Motion designed to voice opinions on issues of the day, without a House of Commons debate. Tory ministers are under no obligation to give it any debating time, let alone a formal vote, on the floor of Parliament.And it’s understood Labour is not ordering its MPs to sign the motion.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey urged MPs to back the motion regardless. He said: “Boris Johnson can’t be trusted to admit whether he or any other Conservative ministers end up being fined by the police. “We’ve seen time and again that his instinct is to lie, blame others or cover up the truth.” No staff feared publishing the damning pictures could harm their reputations, according to the Times. The Mirror has learned one photo shows Boris Johnson holding a bottle of beer at his own birthday party and was taken by his official photographer.Boris Johnson has until tomorrow night tohis Met Police Partygate questionnaire. The Prime Minister was issued with the quiz last Friday - and given seven days to send back the completed form.  He has been consulting lawyers over his responses - and is expected to resist any attempts to oust himhe is slapped with a fine.London mayor Sadiq Khan said it would be inappropriate for him to lean on police and ask them to release photos of the Downing Street parties.He told LBC: Just think how inappropriate it would be for me, a Labour Mayor, getting involved in operational matters where a Conservative politician is being investigated. There are some countries around the world where the police do have their arms twisted in relation to operational issues. I think it is right in our system where I have got no influence in relation to whether the police do investigate Boris Johnson, what is published and so forth. I have always, as the Mayor, been cognisant of the importance of me understanding which side of the line I should be on. Mr Johnson has already admitted attending some of the  gatherings under investigation - including  minutes at a birthday party in his honour, where a photo showed him holding a beer.But according toITVpolitical editor Robert Peston, the PM’s lawyers now believe the relevant test is whether he ed to “proper work” after the gatherings.Well-connected Mr Peston wrote: “If he can prove that he didnapost get drunk and incapacitated, and has proof that he resumed more conventional prime ministerial activities after the seeming parties, his legal advisors seem to think there is a chance he can prove said events were simply part of his working day. “Andhe got sozzled and went for a kip, heaposd be fined.” Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister who analyses Covid lockdown laws, said the argument about whether the PM went back to work afterwards is “irrelevant”. He told the Mirror: “It doesn’t matter what he did before or afterwards - the question is did he participate, andhe spent  minutes at a birthday gathering and there is a photo of him carrying a bottle of beer then he participated. “If someone was working in a building in central London and in the next room there was a rave, and they just popped into the rave for  minutes, it would be absurd to say they had a reasonable excuse. “There is no technical defence of ‘I went back to work’ - there is no technical defence of ‘I didn’t get drunk’. “’I held the beer, I didn’t get drunk’ is like Bill Clinton’s ‘I smoked marijuana but I didn’t inhale’ - it’s nonsense. I don’t understand that to be a defence which could work in the regulations.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonConservative PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rules mean statutory sick pay, currently £. a week, is only available to employees earning £ per week or more – leaving two million low-paid workers, mostly women, without any sick pay at all.The demand comes as Boris Johnson prepares to outline the Government’s plan for “living with Covid” on Monday. He is expected to scrap laws forcing people to self-isolatethey test positive for coronavirus. A letter from TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady and FSB boss Martin McTague calls on the Chancellor to “ensure that all workers that need access to sick pay would receive it regardless of earnings, and make sure that all employers would be able to afford it”. Ms O’Grady said: “No one should be forced to choose between doing the right thing and self-isolating or putting food on the table. “But millions of low-paid workers have faced this impossible choice. “Two years into the pandemic, it’s time ministers stopped turning a blind eye to this obvious problem and fixed our broken sick pay system. “Delivering sick pay for all would be an important first step.” Mr McTague said: “Small business owners are struggling to find £billion a year for sick pay costs. “Last year, the Chancellor responded to our calls for help with a reintroduction of the small employer sick pay rebate until the end of March. “However, with inflation driving up business costs - and forthcoming NICs hikes increasing the tax burden on them to a level not seen since the s – there could not be a worse time to remove the rebate.” Shopworkersapos union Usdaw said “being ill has a huge financial impact on low-paid workers, as too many are forced to live on statutory sick pay”.General secretary Paddy Lillis said: Trade unions secured SSP from day one for Covid absences during the pandemic. “This must continue and be extended to all sickness absences, along with sick pay reflecting average pay and being available to all workers. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Learning to live with Covid is not the same as ignoring it and weakening statutory sick pay would be utterly irresponsible - forcing low-paid people to make choices between their health and putting food on the table.“ Labour fought for the security of sick pay from day one from ministers when negotiating the original Covid Act two years ago.“But even this concession - important though it was - is not enough we still need decent sick pay for all. “Weakening statutory sick pay now would prove once again that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are not on the side of working people.” A Government spokesman said: “We understand how important sick pay has been for small businesses and employees during the pandemic, which is why employers with up to  staff can be reimbursed the cost of up to a fortnight’s statutory sick pay for Covid-related absences. “There is a package of financial support in place for workers who need to self-isolate. “To date, the Government has released £m to local authorities to fund £ support payments for those on the lowest incomes who need to self-isolate.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Trades Union CongressBoris JohnsonBritish economyPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Video shared to social media of the tree in Bude, Cornwall, shows the roots being ripped from the earth. The movement crumbled a nearby wall as the tree fell to the ground in the Triangle - a park in the centre of the town. Tom Cox, , who has lived in the town his whole le, said the tree had been a big part of Bude. Everyone is devastated, he said. Mr Cox said the townaposs fountain had also been damaged, along with a wall and bench. Bude-Stratton Town Council has urged locals to stay inside and away from the fallen tree, adding in a Facebook post: As soon as it is safe to do so our team will work on making the area safer and start to work on the damage caused.The latest tale of destruction comes amid reports that Storm Eunice has ripped the O Arenaaposs iconic roof to pieces, with large holes spotted in the popular London venue. Shocked onlookers in nearby buildings shared videos of the shocking damage. Twitter user Ben Hubbard said: The Millennium Dome is being shredded to pieces by the high wind conditions.First one  was ripped off, then another went too. How much more will this thing be destroyed  He later added another video showing around six  had come off adding: This thing isnapost slowing down.  In another video shared to Twitter, part of the membrane which covers the arena was seen falling into the Thames.Storm Eunice has also brought travel chaos for thousands this morning as a rare red weather warning has seen some regions declare major incidents.Rail services across the country have been cancelled, while flights have also been delayed or cancelled in airports across the UK. People being told to only travel is absolutely necessary. Roads across the country have been blocked by falling trees and debris, with commuters in parts of the north and Scotland waking up to a blanket of snow. The city of Bristol and the Cornwall region have both declared major incidents as they prepare for the onslaught of the storm. Gusts reaching a record-breaking mph have been recorded on the Isle of Wight. And the whole of London and the surrounding areas are now also covered by the red warning zone with fears of flying debris and a danger to le - and meteorologist Ryan Maue has warned that Eunice could bring aposhurricane-likeapos winds to the UK.

The graphic shows the storm making its way across the country from the south west. At one point, London appears to be right in the middle of the storm before it travels further north towards Scotland and across Europe.  An amber weather warning for wind is in place across much of the country, while a rare red warning has been given to areas on the south west coast. The Met Office has warned that flying debris could result in a danger to le, and damage to buildings and homes is likely. Some may experience power outages as lines are brought down, as well as issues with mobile phone service and transport issues. Many train line services have been cancelled amid safety concerns, and passengers who still choose to travel have been warned of further delays and cancellations.  Travellers have been warned that journeys could take up to twice as long as trains will be travelling at a reduced speed, and routes could be affected by falling trees and debris on the track. Met Office chief meteorologist Frank Saunders said: “After the impacts from Storm Dudley for many on Wednesday, Storm Eunice will bring damaging gusts in what could be one of the most impactful storms to affect southern and central parts of the UK for a few years.  “The red warning area indicates a signicant danger to le as extremely strong winds provide the potential for damage to structures and flying debris. Although the most exposed coastal areas in the south and west could see gusts in excess of mph, winds will remain notably strong further inland, with gusts of between -mph for most within the amber warning area.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON JetstreamMet OfficeWeatherStorm Eunice\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Amber and yellow warnings for wind have been issued by the Met Office for much of the rest of the country, including Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Storm Eunice is expected to bring winds of up to mph, and the Met Office has warned of “signicant disruption and dangerous conditions” due to “extremely strong winds”. What danger does Storm Eunice pose   Red weather warnings are rare, but when in place it means flying debris could cause danger to le. According to the Met Office, the extreme weather could also lead to damage to buildings, homes and infrastructure like train lines. This is due to flying debris caused by extremely high winds. The weather agency added that power lines could be brought down. BBC weather meteorologist Ben Rich also said he expected Eunice to “cause damage, huge disruption and coastal flooding”, but said it was “impossible to know exactly how bad this storm is going to be”.How to stay safe  The Met Office has provided a list of advice on how to keep yourself safe during the storm. Before it hits, you could:Secure loose objects such as ladders, garden furniture or anything  that could be blown into windows and other glazing and break them Close and securely fasten doors and windows, particularly those on the windward side of the house, and especially large doors such as those on garages Park vehicles in a garage,available otherwise keep them clear of buildings, trees, walls and fences Close and secure loft trapdoors with bolts, particularlyroof pitch is less than ° If the house is fitted with storm shutters over the windows then ensure that these are closed and fastened If chimney stacks are tall and in poor condition, move beds away from areas directly below themDuring the storm you should:  If possible, enter and leave your house through doors in the sheltered side, closing them behind you Open internal doors only as needed, and close them behind you Take care when driving on exposed routes such as bridges, or high open roads, delay your journey or find alternative routespossible Slow down and be aware of side winds, particular care should be takenyou are towing or are a high sided vehicle Do not drive unless your journey is really necessaryAfter the storm is over, you should:Be careful not to touch any electrical telephone cables that have been blown down or are still hanging Do not walk too close to walls, buildings and trees as they could have been weakened Make sure that any vulnerable neighbours or relatives are safe and help them make arrangements for any repairsRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeWeatherFloodsStorms\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It is thought to be the first time a member of the royal family has brought a case against Her Majestyaposs Government.  Prince Harry - who is not in court this morning - wants to fund the security himself instead of asking taxpayers to foot the bill.Introducing the case this morning, Shaheed Fatima QC, for the Duke, said: This claim is about the fact that the claimant does not feel safe when he is in the UK given the security arrangements applied to him in June  and will continue to be applied to him. She continued: It goes without saying that he does want to come back to see family and friends and to continue to support the charities that are so close to his heart. Most of all, this is and always will be, his home.Mr Justice Swt said todayaposs proceedings were not the main hearing of the Dukeaposs claim and that it would focus on which parts of the court documents will remain private and which will be made public. At the preliminary hearing, the court heard an application by both sides for some parts of the court documents in the case to be kept private. The judge said part of Fridayaposs hearing would be heard in private, adding thatit was not it would destroy the purposes of the application before Iaposve had the opportunity to decide whether it should succeed or fail. The judge later said he would not be issuing his judgment on Friday, but instead in writing at a later date.He added: Part of that judgment may need to be confidential andso that part of the judgment will not be made publicly available. The judge said: My reasons for whatever conclusions I reach today will be made public. Last month, lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex have written a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office. It revealed that they would seek a judicial reviewcontinued security is not provided by the UK, when he and his family visit. The Queen was said to have been notied in advance of Harryaposs plan to send the letter. Prince Harry was to said to have been unhappy with how his security was dealt with in the summer when he ed to the UK for the unveiling of a statue of his mother, Princess Diana.When Harry arrived in April for the funeral of his grandfather Prince Philip, Harry was met on the tarmac at Heathrow Airport by Scotland Yard protection officers.But when he came back again in July, it is thought that was not the case, and it is understood Harryaposs car was chased by photographers as he left.

The monarch is a proud great-grandmother to  little ones ranging in age from  to just five months. But just because they are relatives of Her Majesty does not mean they have royal titles.In fact, only three of them do, they are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. And some of them have not even made an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony at events such as Trooping the Colour.Here we take a look at the young royals who donapost have titles, and which ones havenapost been on the balcony yet... Savannah and Isla Phillips Two of the older of the Queenaposs great grandchildren without titles are Savannah and Isla Phillips.The girls, who are stood either side of Princess Charlotte in the newly seen picture are the daughters of Her Majestyaposs oldest grandchild Peter Phillips. When Peter, the son of Princess Anne, was born in , he wasnapost given a title, despite being fth in line to the throne. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. This explains why Savannah, , and nine-year-old Isla do not have titles either. However, they have appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony - most memorably during Trooping the Colour in .On that day, a cheeky Savannah could be seen teasing Prince George - putting her hand over his mouth as the National Anthem played.Mia, Lena and Lucas Tindall  Another three children to feature in the charming new image are Mia, Lena and Lucas Tindall.Their parents are the Queenaposs granddaughter Zara and her husband, former rugby player Mike Tindall. Zara, a daughter of Princess Anne, followed in the footsteps of her older brother Peter by not being given a title - so none of her children have one either. As of yet, none of the Tindall youngsters have made a balcony appearance with the rest of the royals. Archie and Lilibet Despite their dad Prince Harry being sixth in line to the throne and having the grand title the Duke of Sussex - his children Archie and Lilibet are yet to have titles of their own.However, this could all change in the future and they could become a prince princess with a HRH style and itaposs down to a rule set down more than  years ago. But will only happen when their grandfather Prince Charles becomes King.The tradition stems from Harryaposs great-great-grandfather, George V when he issued a Letters Patent in . A spokesperson for Debrett’s previously told the Mirror: “In , King George V ordered that only the grandchildren of the monarch would be entitled to use the style of prince or princess and HRH, the only exception to this order was that the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales would also be entitled to use the style HRH and Prince. The Queen stepped in ahead of Prince Georgeaposs birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure all the Cambridgesapos children would have fitting titles. However, this does not extend to Archie and Lilibet - although when Charles is King they will be the grandchildren of the monarch and can be styled HRH and prince or princess. They too have yet to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony - and its still unclearwe will see them up there later this year during the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations. August Brooksbank August, who turned one just weeks ago, is the baby son of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank.Unlike his mum Eugenie, who is a princess and has a HRH title - August does not as he is th in line to the throne. The royals last balcony appearance became before August was born so maybe he will be there later this year during the jubilee events  Sienna Mapelli MozziFinally, the youngest of the Queenaposs  great-granchildren is Princess Beatriceaposs daughter Sienna Mapelli Mozzi.She was born just last September and again, unlike her mum, has not been given a title from the Queen.However, as her dad Edoardo is an Italian count, she will inherit a count or countess title.  Edoardoaposs dad, Count Allessandro Mapelli Mozzi, once told the Daily Mail : “Edoardo is the only male descendent taking the family into the next generation.“He is a count, his we will be a countess automatically and any of their children will be counts or nobile donna.” Like her cousin August, she is too young to have made a balcony appearance but maybe will later this year.

Pharmacist Sofia Love, , was diagnosed with eczema at birth and was prescribed creams as a teenager to prevent her skin from developing a painful and itchy rash.With her medication proving less effective as she reached her late teens, Sofiaaposs GP prescribed her a higher potency steroid cream at the age of  to alleviate her worsening symptoms. For five years her cream successfully reduced the red, painful rashes associated with the skin condition. However, in July , Sofia, from from Derbyshire, had a major flare-up in which the skin on her arms, legs, and face became red, inflamed, and itchy.  She began to think that the steroid creams she had been taking for so long were not proving to be as effective as they once had. After conducting her own research online and talking to an old friend from school who had suffered similar symptoms, Sofia began to believe her unbearably painful skin was a sign of topical steroid withdrawal - an adverse reaction to steroid creamsthey are overused or suddenly stopped. Since Sofia had been prescribed with her steroid cream for over five years, she was convinced that this was the root cause of her growing problem. Sofiaaposs condition continued to worsen and her flare ups would leave her with cracked, flaky skin and red, crusty eyes. She even had to go to AE after the extreme dryness in her eyes led to her cornea becoming stuck to her upper eyelid.  Visits to three dferent GPaposs in order to try and find a solution to her ongoing problem did not help, with doctors either not recognising topical steroid withdrawal or conversely offering alternative steroids to combat her symptoms. In January , Sofia decided that she was going to stop taking steroid creams altogether - however, the period of aposcold turkeyapos that has followed has left her feeling worse than ever before. Sofiaaposs skin constantly feels like it is aposon fire apos and aposred rawapos and at night time, her skin cracks and oozes, leaving her pillow and bed sheets damp.However, sleeping is not a surety as the combination of soreness and itchiness has left Sofia suffering from insomnia for over three months.Alongside not using her steroid creams, Sofia is undergoing a aposno moistureapos treatment in which she limits the amount of baths she has each week and avoids moisturising creams in the hope that this will alleviate her soreness in the longer term. I have had eczema all my le and was even hospitalised as a baby because it was so severe, Sofia said. It then fluctuated throughout the years so in my teens I was put on hydrocortisone which seemed to help. This then became less effective so the GP then put me on Mometasone - a high potency steroid cream which I was using for five years between the ages of eighteen to twenty three.  I then had a major flare in July last year and I realised the steroids I had been taking were no longer effective. At the same time, a girl from school made me aware of what topical steroid withdrawal was by sharing her story. I was suffering from exactly the same symptoms and was convinced this is what was happening to me too. When I started to get flare ups I would notice it was always in my eye area and I would have these violent red rashes all up my arm. My skin feels like itaposs on fire and literally burning up.  Trying to regulate my temperature has been one of the most dficult things as my skin will feel like it is incredibly hot, but the rest of my body will be freezing cold. These flare ups often happen at night which has made regular sleep almost impossible and Iaposve suffered from insomnia as a result. My skin feels very thick, like an elephantaposs, and on some days it is painful just to move. It gets so dry and cracks easily which leaves me with oozing sores. I have spoken to three dferent doctors at my local surgery and none of them were able to advise me on what to do next. When I have tried to explain, they have offered me more steroids, which I refused. After struggling to explain her condition to ious doctors, Sofia hopes that sharing her story will spread awareness for the little-known condition. With alternative treatments including cryotherapy and red light therapy planned for the near future, Sofia is hopeful that the dficult journey she has had to endure will soon reach a positive conclusion. I am hopeful for the TSW community as we are growing stronger and wiser even in the short time I have been involved, said Sofia. However, we need additional support from our healthcare system as this condition can have a serious impact on your physical and mental health. I donapost think healthcare professionals have taken this very seriously, so I hope in the future doctors will tell people the implications of long term steroid use. For my own treatment, I am looking into cryotherapy and red light therapy as I have heard these can be quite effective for helping with TSW. Ultimately, I want to try and raise as much awareness as I can for the condition. I would have never had touched topical steroids knowing the long term implication it would have on my le.

The cyclone storm system is expected to bring hurricane winds of mph in parts of the UK as many Brits prepare to hunker down for the day.The Met Office has issued two rare red warnings, only the th time this highest level has been implemented by the national weather agency. Schools, business and transport have been locked down, with an array of other warnings to remain through the weekend, reports Wales Online.The worst of the weather is forecast for South Wales and the south of England. A sting jet is a rare system that sees an incredibly powerful, highly concentrated area of wind within a high-speed storm. The worst of the damage caused in the Great Storm of October  has been attributed to the phenomena - so named because its satellite photos resemble a scorpionaposs tail. They are just  miles in width and last up to four hours in storms that pass across Europe.  The mph jets form when a stream of cold air is pulled down into a warmer system at the head of a storm, creating evaporation and accelerating air speeds. Dr Ambrogio Volonté, of the University of Reading, described Eunice as a “bomb” cyclone, similar in structure to the  storm.According to The , Eunice is a type of cyclone where the cold front does not catch up with the warm front, creating a gap which can pull strong winds towards the ground - creating the sting jet. Dr Volonté added: “It was the sting jet that caused the catastrophic damage associated with the ‘ storm. Met Watch UK says Storm Eunice is “currently undergoing explosive cyclogenesis in the Atlantic and will likely have a Shapiro-Keyser cyclone structure as it arrives”, which means it has a greater chance of a sting jet. Storm Eunice was forecast to last from am today, with strong winds then lasting through the weekend. Major incidents have been declared across come cities and counties, with people advised not to travel unless essential. Eunice comes on the back of Storm Dudley, which claimed one le and left thousands of people without power. As well as warnings of high winds there are also warnings of snow for parts of the country.

Amber warnings for wind and yellow warnings for snow are also in place as the country braces for the worst. Below is when you can expect Eunice to pay a visit to your area - and how severe the conditions will be. Red WarningsSouth West am-noonSouth Wales and Cornwall were hit first with mph winds arriving at am, increasing to more than mph at the peak at around am. The red warning - the Met Office’s highest level - is in place between am and noon.It covers Bristol, Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Isles of Scilly, North Somerset, Somerset, South Gloucestershire and in Wales it is for Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardf, Carmarthenshire, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea and Vale of Glamorgan . Bristollians have been warned the city could experience the strongest winds in the UK at around am with severe gales of more than mph.

Footage taken today at Birmingham’s BHX Airport shows a Vueling plane from Paris to Birmingham vigorously rocking from side to side as it approached the runway.A Ryanair flight from Dublin can later be seen crabbing before landing at the Midlands airport. Crabbing means to point the nose of the aircraft partially into the wind, to the left or right, while keeping the plane itself moving towards the runway.  In the midst of a busy period due to school half-term, a number of flights have been cancelled coming into and out of Birmingham Airport today to destinations including Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam, Munich and Frankfurt. Winds are expected to be at their fiercest between midday and pm in the West Midlands. Elsewhere, British Airways alone has cancelled at least  flights to and from London airports:  serving Heathrow,  at London City. All the cancellations so far are domestic and European.Several other airlines have cancelled some flights in and out of Heathrow, including Aer Lingus from Cork and Dublin, Swiss from Zurich, Lufthansa from Frankfurt and KLM from Amsterdam. Loganair has also cancelled more than  domestic flights including routes from Manchester, Aberdeen, Liverpool and the Isle of Man. At Gatwick, there were  cancellations and  delayed flights. Airports and operators are advising customers to check their websites for the latest flight information and to leave extra time to travel to the airport in case of disruption to the roads.

National Highways said high-sided vehicles and other “vulnerable” vehicles such as caravans and motorbikes could be blown over so should avoid bridges and viaducts. National Highways head of road safety Jeremy Phillips urged those travelling to “plan your trip and take extra care, allowing more time for your journey”. He said: “In high winds, there’s a particular risk to lorries, caravans and motorbikes so we’d advise drivers of these vehicles to slow down.” Network Rail urged customers to avoid travelling on Friday, with many services either cancelled or delayed, and trains running at mph due to the increased risk of having to brake for debris on the track. No trains will operate in Wales for the entire day.

Shocking footage from the M show a lorry being blown over in Wales as parts of the UK is under a aposdanger to leapos rare red alert for wind. A witness said work was underway to get one of the drivers out of his cab as two lorries had been blown over, WalesOnline reports. Traffic on the M motorway between Porthcawl and Margam came to a standstill as gusts of mph caused lorries to overturn in the stormy conditions. People have been advised to stay home as Storm Eunice barrels over parts of the UK. The storm has brought mph winds, the strongest ever recorded in England, the Met Office has confirmed. The Needles on the Isle of Wight recorded the unprecedented wind gust this morning, according to a tweet by the national weather agency.Just before am this morning the Second Severn Crossing was closing because of the conditions - making it the first time both Severn crossings have been shut.  It adds that this is provisionally the highest gust ever recorded in England.Huge gusts from Storm Eunice have ripped the O Arenaaposs iconic roof to pieces, as large holes were seen in the popular London venue. It comes as people in Suffolk have been warned to charge up their phones and prepare for a blackout, as high winds threaten the power supply.  Suffolk Resilience Forum has sent out a message to all residents as severe winds of up to mph are expected until pm.Footage taken today at Birmingham’s BHX Airport shows a Vueling plane from Paris to Birmingham vigorously rocking from side to side as it approached the runway. A Ryanair flight from Dublin can later be seen crabbing before landing at the Midlands airport.  Crabbing means to point the nose of the aircraft partially into the wind, to the left or right, while keeping the plane itself moving towards the runway.Forecasters fear the cyclone could unleash a devastating sting jet, not seen in Britain for more than three decades.The cyclone storm system is expected to bring hurricane winds in parts of the UK as Brits are advised to hunker down for the day.  The Met Office had already issued two rare red warnings, only the th time this highest level has been implemented by the national weather agency. Schools, businesses and transport have been locked down, with an array of other warnings to remain through the weekend.The worst of the weather today is forecast for South Wales and the south of England. Roads across the country have been blocked by falling trees and debris, with commuters in parts of the north and Scotland waking up to a blanket of snow. Rail services across the country were cancelled, while flights have also been delayed or cancelled in airports across the UK. People being told to only travel is absolutely necessary.  A sting jet is a rare system that sees an incredibly powerful, highly concentrated area of wind within a high-speed storm. The worst of the damage caused in the Great Storm of October  has been attributed to the phenomena - so named because its satellite photos resemble a scorpionaposs tail. They are just  miles in width and last up to four hours in storms that pass across Europe. The mph jets form when a stream of cold air is pulled down into a warmer system at the head of a storm, creating evaporation and accelerating airspeeds.

It has left many wondering how longs these conditions will last and when traffic delays and cancellations couldto normal. Wind gusts in the most exposed coastal areas have been predicted to exceed mph, with a record mph winds - the strongest ever recorded in England, confirmed at The Needles, on the Isle of Wight earlier today. The red warning has been in place since am and is due to remain until noon on Friday. There are also amber warnings which apply from am to pm and cover an even larger area. The Met Office added that the dangerous weather phenomenon known as a sting jet - a small area of highly intense wind inside a storm - could form later on Friday.A sting jet is a rare system that sees an incredibly powerful, highly concentrated area of wind within a high-speed storm. The worst of the damage caused in the Great Storm of October  has been attributed to the phenomena - so named because its satellite photos resemble a scorpionaposs tail.

Suffolk Resilience Forum has sent out a message to all residents as severe winds of up to mph are expected until pm. Eunice comes on the back of Storm Dudley, which claimed one le and left thousands of people without power.BBC Wales weather presenter Behnaz Akhgar said: Weaposve got rain to start the day but it will clear through pretty quickly and this storm will go through pretty quickly as well.So we are expecting the main impact of the storm mid-morning and then by this afternoon it will ease off slightly so less of a danger to le later but still will have severe gales through the afternoon as well. More windy conditions to come tomorrow with outbreaks of rain over the weekend.  The forecasting service issued the warning, which covers south Wales and much of southern England, saying: Further strong winds are expected in some southern areas of the UK, which could hamper recovery efforts from Storm Eunice. There is a small chance that some roads and bridges could close and road, rail, air, and ferry services could be affected causing delays and longer journey times. Infrastructure recovery works resulting from Storm Eunice could also be hampered, i.e. power cuts may be prolonged.  The Met Office forecast for Wales for the weekend reads:A dry start with winds easing off. But a band of rain and hill snow soon sweeps across the region through the day, this also bringing gales along southern coasts. Maximum temperature °C. Winds strengthening again on Sunday with early rain turning to showers. Turning drier and less windy over the course of Monday before a band of rain pushes through on Tuesday.

Melissa Tweedie was this week struck off the teaching register after a regulator deemed her behaviour had fallen “signicantly short of the standards” expected.The then--year-old is said to have joined an -year-old pupil from Glenfer High School in Paisley, Scotland, in his hotel room after prom where they had sex.In the freshly released footage, Tweedie is seen wearing a red dress perched on a bed surrounded by young women, and holding a glass of wine, reports the Daily Record.

Any with evidence of the night was allegedly told to erase it. A source at the school said yesterday: This picture was taken after the prom as Melissa was hanging out with some of the sixth form girls with a glass of wine in the hotel. Of course, we all know what happened next.  “There were no drugs and nobody knows anything about her drink being spiked, as Miss Tweedie claimed to her bosses. The next day it was a bit crazy as rumours started to spread about what had happened. “This picture in the hotel has been circulating among the pupils - even though pupils were warned to delete any pictures on their phones of Miss Tweedie in the hotel.  The General Teaching Council for Scotlandheard Tweedie was seen by colleagues dancing inappropriately with pupils and drinking shots at the bar. She later went back to the Premier Inn - but claimed she only did so because of concerns pupils were taking drugs. Tweedie also told investigators that she woke up in bed beside the pupil the next day, but denied she had slept with him and claimed she may have been spiked.The allegation that she slept with the the young man, known as aposPupil Aapos, was found not proven by the . This is despite the teen claiming that he had slept with her after drinking wine, gin, shots and beer. But Tweedie, who now works in Dubai as a yoga instructor, was found to have kissed the teenager.

Just when The Firm thought they had buried one of the most shameful and humiliating periods in its recent history, the Queen has been dealt another hammer blow. Scotland Yard launching a criminal probe into an alleged cash for honours scandal at the heart of one of Prince Charles’s charities is not just another extraordinary development in exceptional times. It may call into question the very fabric of those operating at the heart of the monarchy.  Once again, as she has done many times before in times of trouble, the Queen today summoned the strength to put on a brave face and put duty first. But one could not fail to be moved by her admission, walking stick in hand, that she was unable to move as she would wish while a dignitary was wheeled out for a photo-op at her Windsor home. Just as she should be preparing to revel in the glory of her remarkable  years on the throne, it seems as though events are imploding around her. The family had hoped the shame of Prince Andrew’s involvement with two convicted sex offenders would be finalised ahead of Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year. But questions will surely remain over the Queen’s judgment in helping her son make such a settlement to his sex abuse accuser, which largely remains shrouded in secrecy. All of this against a backdrop of another potential scandal, which may see her son Charles and grandson Prince Harry quizzed by police, albeit as witnesses in the first instance. If ever there was a time to unite and collectively take the strain, now is that time for the family. Whether they are too fractured to do so is a story to be continued.

The Mirror’s research shows the shocking depth of the social care crisisDon Hurst and Winnie in her current care homeByLucy ThorntonNews ReporterClaire Miller:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Thousands of families face the trauma of seeing elderly loved ones kicked out of care homes amid a “tsunami” of providers closing.The number of private care givers handing back local authority contracts has more than tripled in  months, research by the Mirror has revealed.And NHS England data showed that % of hospital patients fit for discharge cannot leave because there is no social care in place for them.On an average day, , patients remained in hospital who no longer met the criteria to be there. And the problem was mainly down to elderly patients being unable to get care in their own home or a residential place.  The Mirror’s research shows the shocking depth of the social care crisis. In , there were  contracts for residential care and care in the community handed back, while in just  months last year the figure was ,. The ed care contracts last year left , vulnerable adults suffering distressing upheaval. Some families were given just  hours to find a new home. The figures, revealed after Freedom of Information requests from the Mirror, suggest  care contracts are being handed back by providers each week. And we reveal the human cost of care home turmoil, with one daughter telling how she found her mother, who had advanced dementia, sitting in the middle of her cold and dark new room, with her head in her hands crying.  And a husband in Liverpool told us how he was “terried” his we, who has Alzheimer’s, would be moved too far away for him to carry on his daily visits. Care home bosses blame the closures on staff shortages, Covid, and a lack of funding from local authorities. The Care Quality Commission said staff vacancies in care homes were up from % in April  to .% in December. Kate Terroni, of the CQC, said: “Staffing pressures are being felt across all health and care settings. More stability in social care is the key that will unlock improved access and quality for the people who use it – and it will also help ease pressure on the NHS, enabling more people to leave hospital in a timely way when they are medically fit to do so.”Health Secretary Sajid Javid is under intense pressure from the unions to step in. UNISON General Secretary Christina McAnea said: “Ministers must hear the clanging alarm bells and invest in social care. “These figures paint a horrying picture of a broken system. Every failed contract means sub-standard care for elderly, disabled and vulnerable people, and workers exploited with poverty wages and little or no sick pay. This has to stop.” Morgan Vine, of Independent Age, said: “We have been receiving a higher number of calls to our helpline from people in this situation. Increased care home closures illustrate just how much some care providers are struggling.”  Justin Russi, who runs care homes in County Durham and Teesside, said: “I got served at the checkout in the local supermarket by someone who used to be my senior carer. She was getting more money, doing less work, pushing someone’s shopping along a conveyor belt. “£. does not cut the mustard when you can go down to the local supermarket and get £ an hour. It’s a joke.” Nicola Richards, from Palms Row Health Care in Sheffield, had to close one of her three homes and warned of a “tsunami” of other closures to come across the UK. She said: “It’s heartbreaking to close a home. Care homes across the country have been in financial dficulty for a long time due to the current care system and a lack of government support.” Our research showed one area hit hard was Southend in Essex, where there were no care home closures at all in , then four in  and six in the first  months of . As of this month, just  remain open in the town. Essex County Council said: “Signicant pressures are being experienced nationwide. Essex is no exception.” From the  replies we received to our FoI requests, London councils were among those least likely to report having contracts handed back, with around half in the capital having none since . But the closures are having an impact on the NHS, data showing hospital bed occupancy at % and  trusts reporting occupancy above % last week.To operate safely, occupancy should be below % to cope with spikes. Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust declared a critical incident yesterday due to overwhelming demand. Miriam Deakin, of NHS Providers, said: “Delayed discharges continue to be an issue, highlighting pressures across the health and care system.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Care staff are working incredibly hard and we are doing everything we can to support them – including through a £. million recruitment fund and expanding the Health and Care Visa scheme to bolster the workforce. “Over the course of the pandemic, we have made available more than £. billion in specic funding for adult social care. “More than  million PCR and  million LFD kits have been delivered to care homes and we have invested a further £ million to support safe and timely hospital discharges to get patients into the best place for their care and support to continue.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON UnisonNHSCare Quality CommissionHospitalsCare homesMental healthNursing homesAlzheimers diseaseFluSupermarketsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The charity is on a mission to provide a place of safety for animals in danger, to educate on the needs of neutering both pets and strays and to neuter stray dogs and cats to prevent the birth of more animals onto the streets. Victoria said: Happy is a really lovely boy who was hit by a car causing him to lose the use of his back legs. It has taken him a while to adjust to his new normal after being an active dog before his accident.Happy is incontinent and will require bladder expression three to four times a day - but Miracle’s Mission is able to provide training for this. Happy needs a garden with grass so that he is able to drag himself without developing sores, said Victoria He is a large dog so any potential foster carers or adopters will need to be able to lt him. Although he has been friendly to the other dogs in his current foster home, Harry has been known to have shown some aggressive behaviour in his previous home Victoria added: He could live with a calm and friendly female dog and any foster carer or adopter would need to have space to facilitate slow introductions. He is not cat or child tested. He is simply searching for a loving home that can accept and love a dog who is incontinent and uses wheels on walks.If you’re interested in rehoming Happy, please contact Miracle’s Mission viainfo@miraclesmission.org.

But after changing brands and seeing no improvement, her GP later diagnosed her with scabies and sent her away with some creams. After seeing a lump on her neck, doctors referred her to hospital - only to find out she had cancer. The make-up artist from Liverpool has gone viral on TikTok explaining how it took six months after scabies diagnosis for doctors to eventually discover her cancer. In November , April was diagnosed with blood cancer Hodgkinaposs lymphoma.April shared her experience in a video on TikTok, which has now racked up over . million views and , likes. “I had this sense that something was wrong, April told Jam Press. I’d even told my mum I thought I had cancer but she put that down to me feeling so anxious.  “Turns out I was right and I’m so glad I kept going back to the doctors. I knew my own body. She even sent her dog away for two weeks, just in case she was allergic. April said: “At first I was trying to work out what I was allergic to. My skin itched day and night from my head to my feet. I was tearing at my skin. “I couldn’t sleep and I was making myself bleed, I was red raw. I knew it couldn’t be scabies as it’s highly contagious and my boyfriend hadn’t caught it.  “I couldn’t get a face-to-face appointment because of Covid so I kept sending more pictures but the doctors said I had no rash or distinctive skin marks for them to make a diagnosis. “In October, I found a lump in my neck that grew quickly. Within three weeks I had an appointment at a specialist head and neck centre. “I was diagnosed with cancer that day after blood tests, CT scans and a biopsy showed I had blood cancer and it was a tumour on my neck.”April’s boyfriend, Sean O’Flaherty, , had been waiting in the car during April’s four-hour appointment but was allowed inside when she was told the news. April said: “I knew as soon as Sean was allowed in [that] it was cancer. I was so scared and just cried and cried. I couldn’t believe I had to drive home and tell my parents I had cancer. I was devastated.” April now faces six months of twice-weekly chemotherapy cycles to kill the cancer which has spread from a lymph node in her neck to her chest and around her windpipe. To make matters worse, April suffered a second tragedy when – before starting chemo – she underwent egg retrieval in case her future fertility was affected and suffered complications.  The fertility drugs used caused oian hyperstimulation syndrome , which made her oies swell and leak fluid into her body. April was in hospital for two weeks with fluid on her lungs and doctors ended up being able to retrieve seven eggs and four embryos. She recently took to TikTok to share her story in the hopes that it will help others and encourage them to trust their instincts. April added: “Iaposm raising awareness for everything Iaposm going through because I want people to know they know their body best.  “If my story helps one person to push for an appointment and listen to their body then I’ll be glad.” The clip racked up more than , likes and was viewed five million times. One user said: “So proud of you! Keep fighting angel x.” “Strong woman,” another person commented. Someone  added: “What you’re going through must be one of the scariest times in your le, thank you for sharing this.

Karyn, a recruitment agency worker, was gloomily chatting to her pal on the phone during a train journey, when a mysterious stranger dropped a note in her lap, before getting off at her stop. The singleton said she expected it to tell her to aposstop moaningapos but when she read the womanaposs words, she was reduced to tears.Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. Instead of a cruel comment, the kind-hearted stranger had written: Youaposre worth more, move on.The note made Karyn realise thereaposs aposmore to leapos than being in a relationship and she now hopes to track down the thoughtful stranger - who she believes could have been sent by her apos angelsapos - so she can thank her properly. Karyn, from Basildon, Essex, said: I canapost remember where on the line she got off but I was looking at my phone and she leaned over and dropped it into my lap. Iaposd been people watching so Iaposd seen she was doing the crossword, she ripped the corner of the page off to write on it. When I read it, I just burst into tears. I looked up to seeI could see her. There were loads of other people looking at me and I got really embarrassed. My friend was on the phone askingI was still there because I couldnapost speak. It was really lovely, I was in fits of tears. It said aposyouaposre worth more. Move onapos. Itaposs so short but it had such a big impact. I wasnapost expecting it, I thought it was going to say aposshut upapos or something, I didnapost expect it to be remotely kind.  Karyn, who was on her way home from work, had hopped on the train in London and called her friend for an emotional chat when the woman handed her the note. The woman, who Karyn thinks might have been around  or , with mousy brown hair and was wearing a trench coat, then hopped off the train without saying a word. Karyn added: It was like a slap in the face. I should listen to my friendaposs advice but I have to learn the hard way, it was a massive wake up call. I was telling Grace about my love le and how Iaposve been treated badly in the past and Iaposm basically giving up and losing hope. I wasnapost crying but I was definitely down. My friend is one of those who tells you not to go back to your ex or talk to your ex. I said I find it hard to move on.I was sick of being on my own on Valentineaposs. It makes you think thereaposs something wrong with you.I have always been a very romance-orientated person. If Iaposm not in a relationship I think less of myself. It was nice for someone to make me see thereaposs more to le. It was a wake-up call to not place so much value on whether someone sends you flowers on Valentineaposs day.

I had one teacher tell me, yeah, drop out, work at McDonald’s since I’ll never amount to anything more in le,” he said.  I dropped out of high school and made a bet with my parents:I make a million dollars by the time I’m , I don’t have to go back to school or go to college.

He now has  per cent of his trading under someone , he said, and had more recently been pouring cash into aeroplanes and “anything with wings” - a pursuit he said was making him good money.Erik caused controversy back in  when he toldBusiness Insiderthat anyone who didn’t get rich investing in crypto in ten years only had themselves to blame.“The area is still relatively small — the market capitalisation is just over half a trillion dollars,” he said. “I do not want to be misunderstood — this is, of course, a very high amount, but in comparison to other asset classes, it’s small. “Therefore, I sayyou do not become a millionaire in the next ten years, then it’s your own fault.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Silicon Valley PLCEducationSchoolsSecondary schoolBitcoin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Even the police seemed mystied as to what was going on when they showed them aposhuman hairapos theyaposd found in their exhaust pipe.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. Deborah told how she was planning a Valentineaposs party last Thursdaywhen her husband arrived home looking aposvisibly rattledapos. The -year-old AE doctor had a large aposclump of hairapos in his hand, explaining that it had been hanging out of their  Ford Expedition.Flustered, they headed out to the driveway, where William began fishing more of the stuff out of the exhaust pipe. Mum-of-four Deborah instantly feared there were human remains inside the family motor, before her true crime knowledge even led her to wonderit could be aposvoodooapos from someone aposout to get themapos. They called the police and even they were left stumped by the whole thing. Weaposd explained that we found it in our exhaust pipe, didnapost know what it was and assumed it wasnapost human hair, recalls Deborah. The law enforcement officer looked at it with total confusion. He was just as baffled as we were. He started kicking it around and looking for body parts. He said there werenapost any, there wasnapost a scalp thataposd make him think it was human hair and there was nothing to indicate it was once alive. He said heaposd file a report and went to ask our neighbours to review their CCTV. Thankfully Deborahaposs brother-in-law was soon able to solve the mystery - it wasnapost human hair at all, it was all caused by a broken silencer, which sheds insulation material when it is about to break.  Speaking about the ordeal, Deborah said: When William ed, he came in and was really flustered and rattled. He said aposDeb, thereaposs hair coming out of our exhaust pipeapos. He held up a clump of hair. He didnapost know what was going on. Heaposs a very calm guy, heaposs used to handling emergencies for work but he was very flustered. I knew something was freaking him out. He said there was a lot more in there and he couldnapost get it with his hands. He grabbed a clothes hanger and went off to finish pulling it out. I went outside to help him and when I got to our car, I saw this mound of hair.  She continued: I instantly thought it could be remains in the car. We listen to crime podcasts when riding in the car together. We both thought it looked exactly like human hair. I thought aposis this a witch-like thing  Is this voodoo apos I didnapost know much about it but it seemed like something out of one of the podcasts weaposd listened to, or The Ring, or Blair Witch Project. It looked like hair. It was soft like hair. I couldnapost really process what was going on. The pair went back inside while William washed his hands and decided they should call the police, fearful someone had tried to intentionally tamper with their car. We didnapost see anybody parts or claws that would make us think it was an animal. It almost looked like a Halloween wig, the mum explained It looked like an intentional act and someone was sabotaging our car. We didnapost know who, or why, but more importantly, we didnapost know what the hair was. Soon their mystery was solved and the couple couldnapost help but laugh when they learned the truth - admitting they were relieved not to be the protagonists in their own horror movie. Deborah, , shared images of the bizarre find online, where she claims her friends joked the aposhighlightedapos muffler hair looked nicer than their own. Deborah said: Weaposd sent out a message to say aposlook what we found - this is horribleapos. Our brother-in-law, whoaposs an IT guy, looked it up online and found what looked exactly like what weaposd found. He said in some cars thereaposs fibrous material they use for insulation. It looks and feels like human hair. When that breaks down, when a muffler is about to go, it sheds the hair-like product out of the tailpipe. I couldnapost believe anything mechanical could cause something like this but sure enough, it looked exactly like what weaposd found. People were seeing the story on social media and they were as horried as I was. I was surprised by the number of people who had had similar happen to them. A lot of my friends were like aposhow does this muffler have such beautul hair with highlights and lowlightsapos  They were joking that the muffler has nicer hair than them.We pay for stories.

The footage captures three of the shipaposs staff holding her arms behind her back as things turned frantic on deck.She can be heard yelling out the name aposAliciaapos as guards help her up a flight of stairs after an alleged hot tub incident. The unnamed passenger was on board the -floor Carnival Valor when it is claimed she jumped into the ocean. A search was then launched  miles from Louisiana coast, but it has now been called off by the Coast Guard in the Gulf of Mexico.  Crews threw le rafts and a flare to help Coast Guard officials with their search for the woman.The woman was removed by security following an alleged hot tub incident on the pool deck of the ship, which carries , guests and , crew members. She was on a five-day cruise that departed New Orleans on Saturday and struggled with security before going overboard.The video doesn’t show the moment she aposjumpedapos off the ship and it isn’t clear how she broke free from the guards.One passengers claimed the woman hit the side of the boat before hitting the water face first.Witnesses have come forward to give their accounts of what happened on board the , ton ship, and said she was escorted away by the Carnival Valor security. Passenger Kim Barnette told WAFB: Security got her out of the hot tub.Whenever they got to take her into custody, apparently she was upset and went over the rail.  Fellow holidaymaker Emil Avenarius told Nola: Security tried to calm her down, and she was belligerent toward them. They had to restrain her because she was combative. She broke loose and flipped herself over the side. The Coast Guard, who were assisted by its aircrew, searched about , square miles for  hours for the woman. They suspended their search at pm on Thursday.  The decision to suspend a search-and-rescue case is never one we come to lightly, Chief Warrant Officer Tricia Eldredge, Command Duty Officer at Sector New Orleans, told Fox . We offer our deepest sympathies to the family during this dficult time. Carnival confirmed their care team is providing support to the womanaposs husband and family. Around  people fall off cruise ships every year on average.

It was a fascinating experience.#The new orchestral work was inspired by Islay’s stunning natural environment, known for its rich terrain and peaty whisky.Five short thematic movements celebrate Islay’s sunrises and coastal shores, while giving a playful nod to the island’s abundant whisky industry.Helen added: #The work centres around The Rinns – a beautul peninsula overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.#My father used to talk about The Rinns of Islay, and as a child, I started to create stories and soundscapes linked to the island.#The work offers a visual, almost cinematic listening experience, with atmospheres and landmarks inspiring the visual imagination.#The work features on a new album Legends and Light Vol. , featuring works by seven composers.While many of the pieces are arranged for orchestral ensembles, listeners will also find the Highland bagpipes and Irish Uilleann pipes featured on the album, offering a deeply rewarding listening experience.Helen is delighted with feedback so far: #I’m thrilled with audiences’ responses to the music.#Listeners have tuned in from across the UK, the USA and as far afield as New Zealand, keeping Scotland on the international map for new music.#"},{"url":null,"title":"travelling right at argyll south pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences. www.heatheryheightsPIC:no_a_HeatherClinging to the edge of Argyll are several well-known Munros and Corbetts that share ridgelines, summits or slopes with surrounding counties. Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

And the Bonnyrigg player was lucky to escape further punishment when he demonstrated his frustration by booting a stray ball over the fence into the adjacent field.Gala continued to dominate in the second-half and player manager Scott came on for his first appearance since taking over from Neil Hastings.And with his first-touch the former Hibs’ player  set up Murray who scored with a superb low angled drive..removeScott then tried his luck with a long-range effort from the half-way line but the keeper got back to save his shot.He then demonstrated his skills on the right wing before firing a low cross into the danger area but there were no takers.With time running out Rose were awarded a penalty, but Kit McRitchie produced a fine ing save to deny Curie and Rovers held on for a well-deserved - victory.Scott told us: “Before the game we told the players that we believe in them.“And we set our stamp on the game early-doors with a goal in the sixth minute and another in the th minute. Normally we have been conceding at these times of late. But to get the first goal then go on to have a dominant performance for the -minutes was very pleasing.“They had a - minute spell of pressure after the sending off but we got a foothold back in the game and it was comfortable in the end.“It’s been a learning curve and myself and Stevieare learning about the team and how they react in dferent situations and how we manage situations going forward.”Craig praised the contribution of Scott and told us. ”He’s hardly trained in three months due to a thigh and a calf problem. I’ve been trying to encourage him and told him that he was capable of playing and managing at Lowland League level. He’s got too much to offer on the pitch just now. Even though Bonnyrigg were down to-men they were dominating the ball but when he came on that settled us.

greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in

his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges."},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive on track for 2022","story":"Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the popular -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.The route is signposted, has a refuel stop half-way around, is marshalled at key points and has a sweeper vehicle to provide encouragement.Family-run restaurant The Gather on Campbeltown Road provides the start and finish point.The route takes cyclists north out of the village towards Lochgilphead on the A before heading onto the B Kilberry single track road.For competitive cyclists, this is a challenging route with an elevation gain of , feet, but for those who are taking it a bit easier, there are lots of photograph opportunities as breath-taking views over Jura, Islay and Gigha are around every corner.Cyclists then head east before following the coast road north, past Tarbert Golf Club, then turning back on to the A toto The Gather.Visit www.britishcycling.org.uk events details  Kilberry-Loop-Sportiveyou would like to enter the  Kilberry Loop Sportive."},{"url":null,"title":"driver woes derail oban golfer bobs title bid","story":"The honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member finished tied in ninth place at the Ras al Khaimah Classic on the final leg of the DP World Tour#s Desert Swing, building on his solid performance over the same course the previous week.After carding an almost flawless opening round of  on Thursday, Robert suffered a cruel piece of bad luck before his Friday round after the face of his driver cracked during his warm up on the practise range.Speaking after carding a  on Saturday, following his  on Friday, Robert said he struggled with his replacement driver.#Unfortunately, my driver cracked on Friday morning and I#ve not got the perfect replacement but no-one does,# said the left-hander.#Off the tee, I#m trying to find my golf ball.

describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the

cats and dogs also being fed.Pat Lemmon, who co-founded the group alongside Linda Mitchell, said that they moved into their new home shortly before Christmas.She said: “We encouraged the community to become more resilient by supporting its most vulnerable people in the ward.“Thanks to an initial donation from the community council we had start-up funds and, because of the brilliant relationship we developed with the Bridge Centre, staff and the Lamp of Lothian, we were allowed to operate from there.“From February to December, we gradually built up our name in the area through leaflet drops, social media and dferent appeals, and have been involved in Christmas, Easter and Mother’s Day appeals.“Then, in November last year, the referrals went through the roof – the hardship of ‘heating or eating’, and in some cases trying to make sure their kids were having a semi-decent Christmas, at the expense of the adult’s health and welfare.“Also round about this time, we realised with groups ing to The Bridge Centre we would have to find alternative premises.“The search began to find new premises and Mitchell’s Close became available.”Discussions are already under way between the group and East Lothian Council for retrospective planning permission at the new premises, previously used by a cake-making company, for a change of use and the installation of a handrail.East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, reported earlier this year that it had recorded its busiest ever month since opening nearly a decade ago.In December, close to , people were helped by the county charity.Mrs Lemmon told the Courier that the Lammermuir Larder, which supports people from throughout the Haddington and Lammermuir ward, had also been busy.She said: “In an ideal world, there would be no need for us.“What has also developed is we see ourselves as being the go between.“Occasionally, we have people we have built up trust with and they like to talk on the doorstep and we can help signpost them on to other agencies that can help.“We don’t just drop the food at the door, we build up a relationship with some of them as well.”People can be referred to the Lammermuir Larder by a range of professionals, as well as by the person themselves, by simply filling out a referral form.Mrs Mitchell stressed: “We are not just supporting people who are unemployed – we are supporting people that are working and still not able to feed themselves or their families.”The Lammermuir Larder has received support from a number of businesses and community groups in the town.Financial donations, as well as collections of food, have been made to the good cause.The group continues to look for donations of items, including small jars of coffee, diluting juice, tins of hot dogs, tuna and potatoes.Donations can be made at a range of businesses, including Kevin Watt Butchers in Haddington and the town’s Co-op store on Hopetoun Drive.For more information about the group, go to

This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as energy efficient as possible while supporting landlords, tenants and homeowners to do the same by signposting to appropriate advice and support from partner agencies.“The new East Lothian Poverty

The SNP does not speak for Scotland.I suggest she herself takes the trouble to meet some more Scots outwith her own separatist circle. She would find those who hold in contempt a First Minister who has spent £ million on overseas offices and countless sums on Gaelic signage and gender identity issues while her own constituency has homeless on the streets and her Health Secretary is complaining about lack of future funding for Covid tests and ambulances who considers it important to tell us all her views on a footballer’s treatment of his cat, and the weather forecast, while saying nothing about long-overdue ferries, failed airports and unfit roads who leads a party which wanted to close down freeports which would benefit thousands, simply because they are an idea which originated in Westminster who panders to a tiny green minority in preventing oil and gas exploration which would provide a much-needed boost to jobs and the economy and who values \"selfies\" at every opportunity rather than addressing real issues.In seeking a leader to be held in contempt, one need look no further than Nicola Sturgeon and her endless grievance-ridden agenda, refusing ever to take responsibility and always blaming someone .Steph Johnson, Glasgow.LOOK TO THE BIGGER PICTUREIT appears that Neil Mackaysees the achievement of independence being conditional upon the campaign being led by those who share his narrow political view. In other words, I would suggest, he is an anti-democrat. I am sure that the vast majority of Yes supporters, like me, want independence because of a fundamental belief that a small country should be governed by its own people not by the big country next door. The wider political and economic bent of the party leading the movement is completely irrelevant.Once independence has been won, a new set of Scottish political parties will evolve – a right of centre party , a left of centre partyand a range of minor parties. The SNP will wither away, its principalcompleted. Then the Scottish people will elect governments that reflect their social and economic beliefs, all of which are currently secondary to the demand for self-determination.Eric Begbie, Stirling.ALL IN THE NAME OF INDEPENDENCENEIL Mackay says once more he is in favour of Scottish independence but doesnt like the SNP. I joined the SNP as a socialist knowing that it was not as left as I would like. Many of the members I met were natural Conservatives or Liberal, but we were all in it together for the sake of Scotlands future.Over the years I contested council seats and parliamentary seats, I climbed thousands of stairs and spoke to thousands of people at their doors. I walked the streets with leaflets, I spoke at open-air rallies and at large indoor assemblies. I helped to organise jumble sales, dances, socials and quiz nights to raise a few pounds for the party.Many a time I stood in cold or rain outside election stations to welcome voters. And all for the sake of what Mr Mackay wants – independence.As a national newspaper journalist for nearly  years I know how easy it is to sit by the typewriter and sort out the world. Yes, it is hard, Mr Mackay, working the doors but, some of us have to do it.George MacDougall, Edinburgh.* NEIL Mackay is a much younger man than me but his excellent column today indicates that his support for independence has arisen from a very similar political journey to my own. Like him, I dont hate the SNP but view independence as an essential democratic goal for our Scottish nation, including those who do hate the SNP.I am often asked why I want to be separated from the English. I always reply that I dont want to be separated from our neighbours in England any more than from my neighbours here in Milngavie but I dont want either our nation or my home to be controlled by the neighbours. Like Mr Mackay I am not a nationalist or a flag-waver and do not think my nation is better than any other, but my nationality is Scottish and I would be happy to fly the EU flag alongside the Saltire.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.LEARNING TO WALK TALL IN THE WORLDNEIL Mackay unwittingly but helpfully demonstrates the internalised cringe of the underdog. His relationship with independence and the SNP is like his relationship with America: \"I love America – I just don’t like long-haul flights.” But independence is a long-haul flight, the route may deviate and the first destination may well not fit Mr Mackay’s vision of it. Independence means dealing with that reshaping it working it out.Scotland’s  years of entanglement with the Union has laid down layers of dependency. Many quail at the task of independence. Others can’t face it. But, to quote the Irish economist David McWilliams, \"independence is how a nation grows up. It’s how you walk tall in the world – as a sovereign nation that deals with its own problems, figures things out. If things go wrong that’s your fault. You create a vision and put together the structure to achieve that vision. You back yourselves to work it out.\"Mr Mackay has not lost faith in independence just the SNP. That’s fine.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig.* NEIL Mackays article was so spot on I wish I had written it myself. I too was a supporter of the SNP for a while, as it seemed at the time, around  years ago, that it could do no worse than Scottish Labour. Dearie me, how mistaken can one possibly be Rick Lawrie, Aberdour.NOTHING MAJOR HAS CHANGEDFROM reading the papers over the last few weeks, it would appear that there is an independence campaign well under way, with extensive coverage of pension provision, companies talking about leaving again and analysis of our economic position. We have even had SNP politicians going off to the Ukraine for an expensive photo opportunity to emphasise their international reputation, asanyone was taken in by that.Back in , the Scottish Government at least had the good manners to announce that a campaign was under way, and gave us a date. No such niceties this time. It seems like the argument is going to be instigated before any plan is in place.The interesting feature in all this is that nothing signicant has changed since . Back then, the Yes campaign lost the referendum because it did not have a compelling economic case. Despite having seven years to recty this, there are no proposals to address this at all. The truth, of course, is that the economic argument is a strength of the Union, and there is nothing that the SNP can do about that. So, having no plan, we have irritating arguments, enough to ert attention from other important issues, but nothing of substance, which even their own supporters can see. Can Nicola Sturgeon not just admit that this is not going to happen, dficult for her as that might be Victor Clements, Aberfeldy.THE LIBDEM VIEW ON EUROPEIN the interests of accuracy I feel obliged to point out a signicant error on the part of your correspondent, Fraser Grant , on where dferent parties stand in relation to Europe.The Liberal Democrat position on Europe was indicated in your paper at the weekend by its Scottish leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, , where he states quite clearly his belief that “the UK’s future is at the heart of Europe”.This as I understand it is also the Liberal Democrat position UK-wide. It is therefore quite  to draw the conclusion that “indy is our only option”.Robert Bell, Cambuslang.Read more: Johnson cannot escape the contempt of the people of Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"inverness-nurse-humiliated-young-mentee-avoids-struck-off","story":"Scott MacPherson repeatedly sexually harrassed a young male nurse who was on placement in the childrens unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.An inquiry heard that the nurse suggested the student perform a sex act on him in order to gain a good assessment.He made futher remarks of a sexual nature that left the student feeling \"embarrassed and uncomfortable\". Later during the sht the nurse continued to harrass the student saying he hadnt received \"payment\".An inquiry by the Nursing and Midwery Council heard that the student called in sick the next day as he could not face going back to work and sought advice from his student representative and parents. He was advised to report the incident to DundeeUniversity and go back to the hospital in the hope the event was an isolated one.However, on the day he ed he remarked that he had a sore neck and the older nurse offered to massage his neck.The student declined and his mentor replied: “I don’t bite, unless they want me to”.The student said he was \"speechless\" that it had happened again and so openly saying, \"I just stared at my water bottle and wished that I could run out or disappear.\" The incidents led to the student nurse leaving the profession.When challenged, Mr MacPherson admitted making the comments but claimed they were not sexually motivated, describing them as \"banter\".However, five charges against McPherson were found proved during an inquiry by the Nursing and Midwery Council which heard fromfive witnesses, including the student nurse, whose evidence was described as \"credible\".\"The  was of the view that the facts found proved had the effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating and offensive environment for Student Nurse A and had the effect of violating his dignity.\"The  noted that following that sht, he took absence on  May  as he felt unable to attend due to the events on  May .\"The  also had regard to his oral evidence where he stated that he was left upset, uncomfortable, felt overwhelmed by the situation, and eventually left nursing.\"The NMC said it had given serious consideration to a striking off order but said it would be \"unduly punitive\" given the remorse Mr Macpherson had showed and he was suspended for six months. "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

But I am proud the team fought to keep the result and the win 💪 pic Fdmadahc— Gabriel MartinelliFebruary , Askedhe had spoken to the Professional Game Match Officials Limitedor their boss Mike Riley, the Spaniard replied: “Not yet.“That’s happening soon but obviously we have reported the opinion and the lack of understanding on the decision.”While he has voiced his displeasure at officiating decisions, Arteta stopped short of suggesting the recent record worked against them when referees were opting to show red cards to his players.“I don’t want to think like that,” he said.“There have been ious reasons, very dferent ones the way we picked up these red cards. Somehow we have to stop it because it is going to affect performances and results for sure, and that has to be our aim and our focus.“Don’t try to blame the ref, we have to believe that the referees are going to do what they have to do, and we have to do, what we have to do – that’s it.”Arteta will be hoping to avoid any further red cards when they host Brentford on Saturday, looking for a victory to move back into the Premier League top four.Preparations for the game were disrupted by Storm Eunice as strong winds battered Arsenal’s London Colney training base.“We had to change the session,” Arteta added. “It was too windy to do what we wanted to do. So we had to adapt and do one part inside and the other one outside.“But we were safe, which was the most important thing, and we managed to do some bits.”One player to take part in the restructured training was Takehiro Tomiyasu, who could feature against Brentford having missed the previous two games with a calf problem. vw,vw,px, px\"Takehiro Tomiyasu could feature against Brentford after overcoming a calf injury “We are all good,” Arteta said on the fitness of his squad.“The doubt was Tomiyasu, who has still not been perfect, but he has trained the last few days. So he’s in contention and we can use him. That’s really positive and the rest we are good.“We know that Gabi is out with the red card that he picked up against Wolves.

He played very well for us against Watford the other week there, so we’re hoping that we can keep him at those levels of performance, we’ll be pleased with that.“He’s really well-liked here amongst the supporters, the performances he’s put in throughout the season already, so hopefully he can focus on his football and we’ll give him as much support as we can until we get him right back to his best.” celebrates scoring in the - win at St James Park in August\" data-title\"Newcastle United v West Ham United – Premier League – St. James’ Park\" data--holder\"PA Archive\" data--notice\"PA Archive PA Images\" data-credit\"Owen Humphreys\" data-usage-terms\"EDITORIAL USE ONLY No use with unauthorised audio, video, data, fixture lists, club league logos or “live” services.

Every manager needs time, needs investment, needs many, many things to be there for a long time or have success, especially in this country.“I have incredible respect for the fact that when I watch his teams I feel there is something new I can learn, and I can improve.“He arrivedand his impact was clear, many teams started to play five at the back. He won the league fantastically well. What happened after, in the second season, I’m not involved. But I think he made his stamp on this league and especially his players.”Guardiola added: “Arriving as a manager in the middle of the season and changing many things is not easy.“In this country, play every three days, a lot of games, and all the managers need time, and unfortunately in football, we don’t have time. I had time – the club gave me this time, and I’m grateful, but all the managers need time, to try to convince the players to follow what you feel.”Guardiola also said Tottenham’s form is a “problem” for City.“The fact that they’ve lost three times, they will be more dficult tomorrow,” he said. “It’s dficult for top teams to lose four times in a row. We need to try, but it’s not easy. They have a lot of weapons.”City’s record signing Jack Grealish looks set to be missing again, having sat out the last two games due to a shin problem, with Guardiola saying: “I think the shin, the symptoms is much less than he had last season .

Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Credit: Tristan Morrow.Niamh CampbellTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA young Kilkenny unionist has revealed that he and his family were forced to move to Northern Ireland after receiving IRA death threats.Tristan Morrowhas made headlines for creating the Irish Unionist Party . He believes the island of Ireland as a whole should become part of the UK – and in turn, separated from the EU – due to what he sees as universal economic benefits for all nations involved.The idea for his new political movement stemmed from his research of past, archetypal Irish unionists.“I then came in contact with a man from Co Clare with similar views to me,” he told the Belfast .“Quickly, we got a big group of southern people who have unionist views. Somebody said that we should start a movement over this and we thought it was a pretty good idea. We started it within the last year, maybe the year before, and we took it quite seriously.“At the moment, we haven’t been having or going to events, but so far we have  members and we should be getting a whole lot more in the coming weeks due to a new contact with the Donegal Orange Lodge. There’s massive interest in it.”But Mr Morrow’s views have led to stress and abuse towards him and other members of his group.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He added: “One of our members got sent a picture of a revolver gun and the guy said he knew where he lived and actually mentioned his house address. We quickly got that sorted by reporting it.“I have received some real-le threats from local republicans. I’m out in the countryside and whenever I’m on my walk into town and back home, I’ve had a car stop in the middle of the road and just rev at me for a good  seconds, and as they’ve driven past they#ve shouted ‘tiocfaidh ar lá’.“I#ve had to live up here in Northern Ireland for a few years now, due to my family having to move away from Kilkenny because of the IRA. I believe it was the Co Laois IRA that had decided they had enough of my family and they gave us a week to move, otherwise they#d kill us all.”Raised on a Kilkenny farm, Mr Morrow said his family is still supportive of him.“My father had saidI was going fully public about my views, that he would stand with me,” he added.He also believes the whole of Ireland should have a referendum to determine whether it would want to join or leave the UK.“In my perfect scenario, I would imagine Ireland taking part within the union sort of like how Scotland does. A united Ireland would be beneficial for both sides, but also I would like us to be united with the English economically and as one nation.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt.

They say residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades.Council chairwoman, Cathy Mason, was one of a number of local politicians provided with a progress report on the Newcastle project last week by senior council directors.She described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as really welcome news.She continued: ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike and I am delighted that the plans are in the final stages. The plans will include a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.Cllr Mason also reaffirmed the view that the rear of the Newcastle Centre is no longer fit for purpose and, as a result, will be demolished in the near future.She continued: ldquoFor too long, the people of Newcastle have had to put up with substandard facilities. I hope to see the finalised plans for the new leisure complex and site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.The council chairwoman said it is essential that the local authority ldquomoves in a timely manner to ensure the leisure centre project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access the new facilities as soon as possible.Cllr Mason said Sinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure the new leisure facilities are delivered, insisting that she will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to provide essential services in the heart of their respective communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to address pedestrian safety in Darragh Cross  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to consider providing a new pedestrian crossing in Darragh Cross as part of a series of measures to make the village safer.The appeal was made by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown when he met with a local roads official in the village last week to discuss increasing concern about pedestrian safety as a result of the speed of vehicles.The Department for Infrastructure has said while there will not be a mph zone implemented in Darragh Cross due to current legislation, it has been asked to extend the current mph in force outside the villagersquos primary school and the nearby Barnamaghery Road.Cllr Brown has also asked the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership to locate one of its electronic speed indicator signs in the village.He said the devices have helped reduce speed in other areas and believes that one in Darragh Cross would be effective with a decision on his request expected next month.ldquoA speed indicator device will help address speeding concerns in an area where children are particularly vulnerable and I would like the sign in place as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoI have also discussed with roads officials the potential opportunity for a pedestrian crossing near the main shop which would be funded by the government departmentrsquos active travel department, which would be another welcome measure for pedestrians in Darragh Cross.Cllr Brown said that as a result of his recent meeting which he described as ldquoconstructive, roads officials gave a commitment to assess safety railings in place a Manse Road.ldquoThis particular issue was raised with me last month as damage to part of the railings is adding to residentsrsquo safety concerns. The assessment will happen after the new local authority-funded play park has been built at the GAA site, he said.Cllr Brown confirmed that he is also pushing for the safety railings to be extended from the Oaks Restaurant to the GAA ground to ldquomaximise the safety of residents, in particular, families with young children who will be making frequent use of the site.He added: ldquoI share residentsrsquo concerns about road safety in Darragh Cross and believe that enacting these measures over the coming months should be a departmental priority.ldquoHowever, I hope that collectively, these steps will begin to alleviate many of the villagersquos safety concerns for the future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Traders.jpg","title":"Traders invited to get  involved in town future  ","story":"TRADERS in Downpatrick are being urged to have their say on the future development of the town with a primary focus on what can be done to revive its economic fortunes.The appeal comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that it is to organise a workshop event to gauge the business communityrsquos key priorities, particularly in a post-Covid environment.Details of the workshop event comes as the debate continues about appointing a dedicated town centre manager who would act as a link between the business community and wide range of statutory agencies and funders to help drive new initiatives and opportunities.Council officers have already spoken with a number of businesses on the issue, but it was confirmed at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee that a more co-ordinated plan now needs to be developed.Officials argue this is necessary in order to agree priorities on the way forward to manage expectations through the development of strategy focused on the needs of the town.Plans for a workshop to discuss the issue are being drawn up with appeals to everyone in business in Downpatrick to take part to provide as wide ofview of the potential way forward as possible.The workshop will focus on the main priorities to help develop a new strategy with calls for an independent person to head up the exercise which, it is hoped, will outline recommendations on the way forward.A proposal to appoint a Downpatrick town centre manager to help plan the townrsquos economic revival and long-term future was tabled last year and referred to the council committee for discussion.A number of councillors believe such an appointment is a ldquocritical component of the drive to support the business community, increase footfall and, crucially, help attract new investment to the county town.It has been suggested a town centre manager could work closely with the business community to develop fresh ideas and initiatives, but nothingwill happen before the outcome of the proposed workshop is known.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed confirmation of the workshop and are fully supportive of the development of a strategic plan being mapped out for the town.Cllr Curran believes that appointing town centre manager deserves close attention and is keen to hear what the business community and other stakeholders have already said about the way forward.ldquoI see great merit in having a dedicated town centre manager, he continued.ldquoThe proposed workshop that is to be held is crucially important and I would appeal to everyone in business to get involved and have their say. This is a crucially important exercise and it must happen as soon as possible.Cllr Curran believes one area that requires particular focus is developing Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy which he is confident would help breathe new le into the town centre.He is also keen for Downpatrick to have an umbrella body representing all business groups and interests, pointing to the success of Chambers of Commerce which he believes play important roles.ldquoAgreeing the way forward for Downpatrick is crucial and a new strategy can help kick-start the townrsquos economic revival, especially at a time when ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran added.Welcoming plans for the workshop, Cllr Hanlon said it has been identied that a strategic plan needs to be considered to focus on the needs of the town.She also confirmed that she as met with a number of stakeholders who believe that Downpatrick needs a strategic plan.ldquoThere is so much effort and productive work from local groups such as the Town Committee and Community Collective alongside local businesses, Cllr Hanlon continued. ldquoEngagement from a iety of stakeholders via theworkshop will ensure that we have a bold and progressive plan for the future of Downpatrick.She added: ldquoCouncil assistance to facilitate this is will be imperative as we continue to build our local economy, arts and events offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Minister.jpg","title":"Tributes and presentations to Downpatrick clergyman  ","story":"ANOTHER chapter in the distinguished history of Downpatrick Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church closed last Sunday when the Rev Dr David Speers preached his final service after  yearsrsquo service.Dr Steers, who was also in charge of Ballee and Clough Non-Subscribing Presbyterian churches, is leaving the district to take up a new post in Dunmurry.He introduced his final service with the history of the replica High Cross which stands at the entrance to the Down Cathedral, explaining how its engravings depict Jesus Christ and the prophets St Anthony and Paul and how the illustrations guided the early Christians over a thousand years agoDr Steers said the Non-Subscribing congregation in Downpatrick worships in a building erected over  years ago, encouraging them to keep this faith going.He continued this theme with readings from Psalm  and the first letter to John, explaining the dference in the perception of God from the Old to the New Testament, with the departing ministerrsquos sermon reminding the congregation that despite their comfortable lives, to continue to do Godrsquos work in the community.Laura Patterson accompanied the hymns lsquoHoly, holy, holyrsquo, lsquoJust as I amrsquo, The Lordrsquos my shepherdrsquo and lsquoGod sent his Sonrsquo.At the conclusion of the service, church treasurer, Carol Nixon, spoke of Dr Steers leadership, pastoral care and how he led by example, fully participating in all the church worship and witness as well as many fundraising events.In addition, she reminded those in attendance of his leadership, both within the church group and in the community where he is well known and respected by all denominations, and wishing him the congregationrsquos blessing in his new charge.The Downpatrick churchrsquos senior elder, Mr Freddie Straney, made a presentation to Dr Steers and thanked him for his loyalty and  yearsrsquo service.Eileen Neill, on behalf of the younger members, presented Dr. Steers with a delightful and talented illustration of the Downpatrick church which she had created, with Ms Nixon presenting the ministerrsquos we Sue, with a flower arrangement, thanking her for the many ways she had supported her husband both in and outside the pulpit.Also during Sundayrsquos service, the congregation took the opportunity of presenting Mary Stewart with a gold brooch, church illustration by Eileen Neill, flowers and rose plants to mark her  years as church secretary.Dr Steers responded to his gts with moving words which touched everyonersquos spirit.He recalled how he became associated with the church in  and was in charge in  before being fully appointed in the group, also thanking Mary for all her work.The ious speeches were dficult and emotional, but very sincere and from the heart. It was a day of surprises which will remain in the thoughts of the retiring minister and his we, church members and office-bearers.Although Covid restrictions prevented the members from giving Dr. Steers and Sue a send-off befitting their service to them, such was their appreciation that it took two hours for everyone to say farewell.As the churchrsquos fourth longest serving minister, Dr Steers completed  years in full time charge in addition to being minister-in-charge for several sessions between  and .He was a member of the local ministerial group which organises collective worship and remembrance events such as inter-denominational services and Remembrance Sunday as well as highlighting and supporting worthy causes.Over the years Dr Steers conducted in excess  regular services as well as special services including Christmas celebrations. In addition, he undertook over  memorial services as well as weddings, renewal of vows and baptisms with these totals undoubtedly tripling when the Ballee and Clough churches are included.Dr Steers represented the denomination in  at a special service in Transylvania and attended and conducted the funeral services both here and on the mainland of some of the churchrsquos most distinguished serving ministers.Over the years, while celebrating the churchrsquos tercentenary, Dr Steers was a tremendous support in the church history and, more recently, its graveyard inion booklet.He also compiled a book entitled rsquoFirst World War Roll of Honour of the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Irelandrsquo containing all the members of the denomination who served and who gave their lives in defence of our country. The publication was launched at a special service in our church in November .Former church secretary Mary Stewart added: ldquoWhen the church history is read in years to come our records, just as they have down through the ages, will record names and dates of those who served.ldquoWe know however that a le of service goes beyond this. It includes sharing moments of sadness and tears but also memories of joy and laughter which we have had together in Downpatrick. We wish Dr. Steers, his we Sue and the family, good health and happiness in his new appointment in Dunmurry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13484181.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo: George SweeneyThe Sinn Fein Communities Minister made the promise amid an ongoing controversy after she announced that she was unable to progress a £. million programme to redevelop local sub-regional football stadia due to the absence of a ing executive.In recent days she has batted away accusations of sectarianism, after the DUP heavily criticised a decision to halt the scheme while continuing the redevelopment of the GAA’s Casement Park.Ms Hargey told the BBC on Thursday that she would be writing to her fellow ministers to seethe funding could be released, despite the absence of a fully ing Northern Ireland Executive.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We need to find a way of unlocking that money without the Executive,” she said.Ms Hargey has claimed that while the funding has been secured for the initiative, the approval of the wider Executive is required before it can progress to allocating funding for projects at specic grounds.Ms Hargey has blamed the DUP for the situation, claiming the party’s decision to pull Paul Givan out of the first minister’s role meant the stadia programme had to be placed on hold until a ing administration is back in place.The DUP has disputed this position and contrasted it with the minister’s insistence that the redevelopment of the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast can continue despite the Stormont crisis.On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Department for Communities said: “The Minster has been clear that the .m to regenerate stadiums is ring fenced.“The Minister is absolutely committed to delivering this investment to support clubs and build first class facilities.“It is well known that options for the future of the sub regional stadia programme requires Executive approval.“The collapse of the Executive is preventing the regeneration of local stadiums.“The Minister is exploring all options available in the current situation.“Today the Minister held a meeting with representatives of the IFA and NIFL and agreed to work together to progress this project to the next stage.”In a statement released following that meeting with the Irish Football Association and the Northern Ireland Football League, Ms Hargey said that she had welcomed the chance to “reaffirm my commitment and intention to deliver this much needed scheme”.She said that she had told the two footballing bodies that she would work with them to “progress this project to the next stage”.Following that meeting, Northern Ireland Football League boss Gerard Lawlor said: “We held an open and frank discussion and we received assurances: the programme will proceed as planned, acknowledgment that an increase on the m is required and is being sought, and the programme remains a flagship project for the Executive.“Communication is key in the delivery of this programme going forward and I hope to see it delivered in a timely manner,” he said.The DUP has sought to portray the comments of Ms Hargey as a u-turn.The party’s deputy leader accused Ms Hargey of attempting to “play sectarian politics” with the issue.“The Minister has had two years to deliver the funding.“Indeed, last September she told us it was just weeks away,” Paula Bradley said.“It’s time for Minister Hargey to set her Sinn Fein political games to the side and get on with her job and deliver the funding.”Deirdre HargeyDUPSinn Fein  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularWhat time will Storm Eunice hit  When and where will Storm Eunice hit -

Both of them blamed DUP-Sinn Fein tinkering with the Good Friday Agreement - a deal driven by the UUP and SDLP - by means of the St Andrew’s Agreement in  . Both said the DUP-Sinn Fein tinkering seriously damaged the partnership ethos of the  deal, as envisioned by its UUP and SDLP architects.Lord Reg Empey and Alban Maginness, members of the UUP and SDLP talks teams that secured the Good Friday Agreement, say DUP and Sinn Fein tinkering of the agreement led directly to more sectarian politics we see today.Lord Empey said: “What has happened is that the agreement that we negotiated [in ] was changed.”He said this was done in   in the legislation based on the St Andrew’s agreement.“Under our proposals that we had ratied [in ], the largest party in the largest designation, i.e. unionist or nationalist, would provide the First Minister and the largest party in the second largest designation would be the deputy First Minister. Two names then went before the assembly on a single resolution to be elected by the assembly in a cross community vote. But that was changed to suit Paisley and McGuinness.”He claims Paisley did not want to be seen on a joint resolution with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness and that McGuinness did not want to be subject to a unionist veto, due to his paramilitary past. And this, he believes, this is at the root of the tensions today.“It has completely changed the way the whole way devolution operates. The tenor of election manestos changed after that with a major focus on keeping the other party out or securing First Minister for Sinn Fein.”He added that under the original legislation, “there would be no question of Sinn Fein being first minister because there would be more pro-union MLAs than nationalist MLAs.”But his criticism does not simply extend back to  .“The DUP has also been resisting attempts in Parliament that we have been making in the last number of months and weeks to try and change the legislation back to the original proposal.”Former SDLP MLA Alban Maginnis agreed the tone of politics has declined.“It is both polarised and rancorous but there is a degree of rancour which should not be there given the elapse of some  years since the GFA.”John Hume wanted “power sharing... partnership between nationalists and unionists in the new assembly and the new executive and indeed between north and south.”This had started to blossom, he said. “But then the radical changes that took place in terms of voting and so forth in  [in the St Andrews Agreement].”“And that I think led to a more polarised electoral race between Sinn Fein and the DUP.”He terms the DUP and Sinn Fein “ethno-nationalist blocs” whereas the UUP and SDLP he terms “civic nationalist parties”.He believes both David Trimble and John Hume made major sacrices, even in terms of their own parties, to secure the Belfast Agreement.“They were selfless in their approach. They wanted a settlement, they wanted to solve problems, they wanted to bring their communities together in terms of partnership and there were people there who didn’t want that to happen, particularly the DUP and Sinn Fein.”He accepts that Ian Paisley, Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson all worked together well in the top two jobs, but says the DUP and Sinn Fein grassroots were not supportive.Askedhe thinks “ethnonationalism” needs a “bogeyman” in order to , he claimed: “Ethnonationalism sees itself in a struggle to defend itself and its political community and it is therefore constantly being defensive and at the same time trying to assert its dominance one over the other. I think that is the problem.”The News Letter asked the DUP and Sinn Fein why they changed the means of electing the First and Deputy First Minister - and why they didn’t back recent efforts to change it back again. The News Letter also askedthey prefer the St Andrew’s arrangements because they believe it will better motivate their voters to turn out The DUP response did not address any of the questions.Fermanagh  South Tyrone MLA Deborah Erskine responded: “A SF win at the election would take Northern Ireland in the wrong direction. They would have more MLAs, more Ministers and more influence than any other party. That would be bad for Northern Ireland. We want to spend the next decade fixing our health service, driving down waiting times, improving our schools and making Northern Ireland better. SF want to spend the next decade undermining Northern Ireland and talking about a border poll. “Unionism needs to stand together rather than attack each other. Reg just cant help himself attacking fellow unionists.” Sinn Fein offered no response.MORE NEWS:UUP rejects DUP-TUV election deal to ‘maximise unionist votes’ in Assembly electionDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and TUV leader Jim Allister strike a deal to ‘cooperate’ at Assembly election call for UUP leader Doug Beattie to join them‘Chilling warning that stopped me selling explosives to the IRA’ - ex-gangster John Lawson tells how he escaped a le of brutality and crimeStorms Dudley and Eunice: Met Office amber weather warning of ‘very strong winds’ across Northern Ireland over three daysA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Many employers will have a ‘bad weather policy’, so it is always worth checking your contract. However, on a general note, employers do not have to pay employees who are unable to get into work, subject to their contract.Employees are expected to make reasonable efforts to attend work despite any severe transport disruption or road closures. However, it is usually best practice to be flexible in these circumstances by allowing employees to request the time off as annual leave or to work from home.With the help of technology and the coronavirus pandemic, many employees should be able to work from home. However, it is important to remember your employer should not force you to attempt the journeythere are legitimate concerns for your safety.\" alt\"Penarth Times: Storm Eunice weather warnings map. \" class\"editor-image\"Storm Eunice weather warnings map.If your employer has closed the office because it is inaccessible they should usually still pay employees for that day. Withholding pay when employees are unable to work through no fault of their own could be considered as an unauthorised deduction from wages.In those circumstances, employees may be able to bring a claim against their employer. However, it should be noted that some employment contracts contain a temporary ‘lay-off’ clause. If this is the case, employers can refuse to give the full amount of pay to employees to a limited time.Can you take time off workyour child’s school is closed due to Storm Eunice Schools are often closed when there is bad weather, forcing many employees to stay at home to look after their children.

Here is everything you need to know.\" alt\"Penarth Times: The Army has been placed on standby as the UK prepares for the arrival of Storm Eunice. \" class\"editor-image\"The Army has been placed on standby as the UK prepares for the arrival of Storm Eunice.Whether employees get paid on days when they cannot make it into the office will largely depend on their contract of employment. Many employers will have a ‘bad weather policy’, so it is always worth checking your contract. However, on a general note, employers do not have to pay employees who are unable to get into work, subject to their contract.Employees are expected to make reasonable efforts to attend work despite any severe transport disruption or road closures. However, it is usually best practice to be flexible in these circumstances by allowing employees to request the time off as annual leave or to work from home.With the help of technology and the coronavirus pandemic, many employees should be able to work from home. However, it is important to remember your employer should not force you to attempt the journeythere are legitimate concerns for your safety.\" alt\"Penarth Times: Storm Eunice weather warnings map. \" class\"editor-image\"Storm Eunice weather warnings map.If your employer has closed the office because it is inaccessible they should usually still pay employees for that day. Withholding pay when employees are unable to work through no fault of their own could be considered as an unauthorised deduction from wages.In those circumstances, employees may be able to bring a claim against their employer. However, it should be noted that some employment contracts contain a temporary ‘lay-off’ clause. If this is the case, employers can refuse to give the full amount of pay to employees to a limited time.Can you take time off workyour child’s school is closed due to Storm Eunice Schools are often closed when there is bad weather, forcing many employees to stay at home to look after their children. If a school was closed at short notice, this would constitute an emergency relating to a dependant, in which case, you would be entitled to take time off as dependency leave.This type of leave does not have to be paid. Your employer can not refuse you dependency leaveyou have no other choice and you cannot be disciplined or sacked for taking the time off.For further employment law advice, visit the Lime Solicitors websiteAre you sure you want to delete this comment Yes, delete the commentNo, keep the commentReport This CommentGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Most popularCommentedLoading...Read more Contact UsHelpNewslettersPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

You go into the likes of Ballybogey and Bushmills and they have facilities for all weather and they can play all year round.“We have  kids eager to play and yet we go through this every year and the pitch cuts up. It can’t take the weather and can’t take the elements.”Portrush FC Youths would like to see a G or G pitch installed enabling the youngsters to play in all conditions.Mr Quigley said: “Let’s move with the times. We are happy to try funding, we know council don’t have the money to pay for it all but eventhey say we are willing to pay a percentage towards it but unfortunately we aren’t getting anything from them.“There’s a chance some of those kids won’t come back. They are trying to run through the muck and there’s tears because they were falling in the mud then they were soaking wet and freezing cold. These are six and seven-year olds, it would be dferentthey were on a G pitch that wouldn’t be an issue and it’s a far better environment.“It’s demoralising for us as coaches to go down there and try and get kids to kick a ball through a mud bath.”Addressing his comments to the councillors who represent the Causeway DEA, the club Chairman added: “Please come down and take a look at it for yourselves and see what we deal with on a daily basis. Speak to the coaches, the parents and children.“These kids are speaking to their friends who are saying I was training at Coleraine on the G or at The Showgrounds but we don’t have that luxury, we can’t even get a slot up there to hold a training session.“We don’t really want to take the kids out of Portrush and not everybody has a car and then we have to take into account the additional cost of travel for parents.“It is so frustrating that from  when I started to  we are still struggling with the same issue. We have kids coming from all over, from Bushmills and Portstewart as well as Portrush and people have had enough. Would you want your kids playing in conditions like this  I doubt it.”The DUP Causeway DEA councillors spoke of their commitment to help Portrush FC Youths adding that a meeting has been arranged with the club and council officials within the coming days which is the next stage of an ongoing process.Councillor Mark Fielding said: “I have been working with the club on ious issues since  and will continue assist them now and in the future.“It is quite obvious that there is issues to resolve with the current facilities in order to ensure that they are of a standard that meets the needs of the club and local people.”Fellow Causeway DUP Councillor John McAuley added: “Following contact this morning from Portrush FC Youth regards the condition of their facilities, I have had discussions with the club and council officers with a view to achieving short, medium and long term improvements. “I have been involved in local football now for nearly  years so I am well aware that winter training has and continues to cause many clubs a problem. “The good news is resolutions are possible and have been achieved in other areas of the borough in the past.“I am committed to giving Portrush FC Youths support to get the same outcomes for their facilities.East Londonderry MLA Maurice Bradley said: “I was in talks two years ago with council officers on behalf of the Coleraine and District League as part of the council’s consultation process into the borough’s pitch strategy. “As part of an overall strategy it was recognised that there was a lack of G facilities in the borough and Parker Avenue was in the mix along with other sites.“I would be happy to meet with Portrush Football Club and Portrush Youths at any time to discuss facilities. “I have been having meetings with council officers with the hope of having roll-on, roll-off goals at Parker Avenue and other grounds.“I believe that facilities are important, facilities allow clubs to grow and sports enthusiasts to improve. “But, in the short term, I would encourage members of Portrush Youths to lobby their local councillors.“Having been involved for many years in football and campaigning for better football facilities right across the old Coleraine Borough Council area, I support improving facilities for Portrush Youths and also for all clubs across the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council area.”Meanwhile, SDLP MLA Cara Hunter posted on the club’s social media that she would ‘be writing to the Department for Communities and Sport NI to identythere are any funds to resolve this ongoing issue.’When contacted, a spokesperson for Causeway Coast  Glens Council said: “The club’s designated training pitch was passed fit for purpose at the beginning of this week.“Council officers will visit the site today to assess the ground conditions and, in the interim, will engage with the club to offer an alternate venue.”The Local Democracy Reporting Service contacted other councillors, however, they had not responded at time of going to press.Read More Read MoreKillowen PS kids learn about ‘refill’Mark FieldingCara HunterPortrushBushmills  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdabbbfeba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcabaffcba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdabbbfeba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcabaffcba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645108869381.jpg--covid_19___thu_17th_february_figures.jpg?164510887000","title":"covid  thu th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.
