Similar tampering had taken place for years.It said the school wanted fewer female doctors because it anticipated they would shorten or halt their careers after becoming mothers.          Tokyo Medical University manipulated all results starting in 2006 - and possibly even earlier - systematically deducting entrance exam points for women and increasing those of men          Backtrack: Miyazawa, left, and Yukioka made a public apology for the school\u0027s behaviourThe university\u0027s managing director, Tetsuo Yukioka, said: \u0027We sincerely apologise for the serious wrongdoing involving entrance exams that has caused concern and trouble for many people and betrayed the public’s trust.\u0027He denied previous knowledge of score manipulation and said he was never involved.\u0027I suspect that there was a lack of sensitivity to the rules of modern society, in which women should not be treated differently because of their gender,\u0027 he said.Mr Yukioka said women were not treated differently once they were accepted, but acknowledged that some people even believed women were not allowed to become surgeons.Nearly 50 per cent of Japanese women are college educated — one of the world’s highest levels — but they often face discrimination in the workforce.Women also are considered responsible for homemaking, childrearing and elderly care, while men are expected to work long hours and outside care services are limited."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/20/4EE8B2A400000578-6035613-image-a-41_1533669952081.jpg","title":"Discovery Channel treasure hunter claims hes evidence extra terrestrial visit","story":"    Darrell Miklos and his team discovered the USO (unidentified submerged object) in the Bermuda Triangle close to the Bahamas. He spotted the large obtrusions while exploring the area in a submersible looking for shipwrecks. \u0027I was trying to identify shipwreck material based on one of the anomaly readings on Gordon\u0027s charts when I noticed something that stuck out, that shocked me,\u0027 said Miklos in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com          Horizontal cylinder structures jut out from this large dome feature at the center of the site. Geophysicists on the team report that the coral covering these structures appears to be more than 5000 years old.           A close up of one of the horizontal structures which has scientists baffled. Because of the extreme currents at the location it\u0027s almost impossible for coral to grow at all, let alone into a anything this large          Here, what he describes as the right jutting section of the USO.  According to scientists on Darrell\u0027s team, no coral anywhere in the world could grow in this formation naturally, there would have to be an underlying structure to support that type of growth          Miklos, 55, described what he found while filming episode seven of Cooper\u0027s Treasure and tells how he and his team want to bring the \u0027alien spaceship\u0027 to the surface \u0027It was a formation unlike anything I\u0027ve ever seen related to shipwreck material, it was too big for that. \u0027It was also something that was completely different from anything that I\u0027ve seen that was made by nature\u0027          These horizontal structures are massive, each measures as much as 300 feet straight out, the length of a US football field. The explorer also found other bizarre and unexplained formations around the main object, all of which are covered in thick coral which he believes are hundreds if not thousands of years old          These mystery shapes score the top of the massive central mound. Each of these lines is the width of a family home          Here you can see the gigantic mound rising above the ring of structures that stick out from the center. The entire site\u0027s diameter is some 600 feet - the length of two football fieldsBut instead the veteran treasure hunter found a bizarre structure like nothing he\u0027s ever seen.The huge unidentified submerged object (USO) has 15, 300ft long obtrusions jutting from its side.In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com Miklos, 55, described what he found while filming episode seven of Cooper\u0027s Treasure and tells how he and his team want to bring the \u0027alien spaceship\u0027 to the surface.He recalls: \u0027We were doing a scene where I was sitting in a two man submersible.\u0027We were out in the Bahamas and we were on an English shipwreck trail, somehow related to Sir Francis Drake.\u0027I was trying to identify shipwreck material based on one of the anomaly readings on Gordon\u0027s charts when I noticed something that stuck out, that shocked me.  In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com Miklos, 55, described what he found while filming episode seven of Cooper\u0027s Treasure and tells how he and his team want to bring the \u0027alien spaceship\u0027 to the surface\u0027It was a formation unlike anything I\u0027ve ever seen related to shipwreck material, it was too big for that.\u0027It was also something that was completely different from anything that I\u0027ve seen that was made by nature.\u0027It\u0027s almost like there are five arms coming out of a steep wall cliff and each one of these is the size of a gun on a battleship. They\u0027re enormous and then there\u0027s five over here and five over there, 15 in total.\u0027There\u0027s identical formations in three different areas and they don\u0027t look nature made, they don\u0027t look man made, certainly nothing I\u0027ve ever seen based on my experience and I have years of experience at doing this, we\u0027ve identified multiple different types of shipwreck material, this doesn\u0027t match or look anything like that.\u0027The deepest part of the site is 300 feet below the surface, ers had to use special breathing apparatus and a state of the art submarine to access it.The explorer also found other bizarre and unexplained formations around the main object, all of which are covered in thick coral which he believes are hundreds if not thousands of years old.Blown away by the discovery, when back on board his ship, Miklos decided to dig further into Cooper\u0027s files to find further clues.Significantly, the astronaut had written \u0027unidentified object\u0027 on the chart of the area rather than mentioning any historical shipwreck.\u0027I investigated some of Gordon\u0027s charts, I realized that there was something else on there that Gordon was referring to,\u0027 he said.\u0027Then it made sense to me why it wasn\u0027t identified as a shipwreck... he had to mean it might be something from another world.\u0027Gordon believed in aliens. He believed that we had visitors from other planets and he also believed that a lot of these things landed in this particular part of the world.\u0027          The treasure hunter has made the astonishing \u0027unexplained\u0027 discovery deep beneath the Bermuda Triangle.  Miklos believes  it could provide the first evidence of an extra-terrestrial visit to earth hundreds of years ago.          The deepest part of the site is 300 feet below the surface, ers had to use special breathing apparatus and a state of the art submarine to access itGordon Cooper successfully piloted the Mercury-Atlas 9 Faith 7 Spacecraft around the Earth 22 times in 1963 paving the way for men to reach the Moon.He was a pioneer who became the first American to sleep in space and the first to fly twice.He was also the first American televised from space.But as well as researching the limits of human endurance he was also charged with a secret spy mission while in orbit.Using special \u0027long range detection equipment\u0027 Cooper was asked by the US government to look for \u0027nuclear threats\u0027 - which likely meant Russian submarines or nuclear missile sites.But Miklos says Cooper - an avid treasure hunter - also noted the positions of Caribbean shipwrecks while he conducted this spy mission, and created a map on his return to Earth.The shipwreck hunter claims long time friend Cooper gave him the maps - which included detailed charts and exact coordinates - after he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s and then died in 2004 aged 77.In the first season of the show Miklos and his team used Cooper\u0027s map to make a remarkable discovery in the Caribbean - a centuries-old anchor believed to be from one of Christopher Columbus’ ships.Cooper\u0027s maps led Miklos to dozens of other significant ship wrecks across the Caribbean worth millions of dollars.But with this latest discovery the Californian is conscious of being labeled \u0027crazy\u0027 by coming out with wild claims that Cooper\u0027s map might now have led him to an alien spaceship submerged under the ocean.That\u0027s why he says he wants to remain \u0027neutral\u0027 until he can investigate the mysterious site further.Miklos and TV production company AMPLE Entertainment are now hoping the Discovery Channel will commission a third season of Cooper\u0027s Treasure so they can do just that.          United States astronaut Gordon Cooper (1927-2004) pictured wearing his Mercury space suit used in early phases of the Project Gemini training program in the United States circa 1961. (Photo by Rolls PressPopperfotoGetty Images)Miklos said: \u0027I want to investigate it. I want to see what it is, because it may be nature made, just a freak of nature, but given its placement in this particular part of the Caribbean and given what Gordon has told me about visitors from another planet and the things that I\u0027ve seen, I think it\u0027s definitely worthwhile investigating.\u0027AMPLE Entertainment founders Ari Mark and Phil Lott, who are behind Cooper\u0027s Treasure, are equally as excited.Mark told DailyMail.com: \u0027In the first two seasons we didn\u0027t enter too far into Cooper\u0027s UFO interests and what he had told Darrell about what he had seen.\u0027I don\u0027t feel like we\u0027ve even scratched the surface of what\u0027s in Cooper\u0027s files, but that\u0027s what we hope to do in a third season.\u0027The bottom line is that Cooper spotted anomalies and it is his maps that led Darrell to this discovery.\u0027Cooper was a reliable source for treasure, then based on his findings Darrell found something that does not appear to be a shipwreck or anything that anybody has ever seen.\u0027We want to find out exactly what it is and establish whether it ties in with Cooper\u0027s belief that we\u0027re not alone.\u0027During his post-NASA career, former US Air Force Cooper became well known as an outspoken believer in UFOs and claimed the government was covering up its knowledge of extra-terrestrial activity.\u0027I believe that these extra-terrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth,\u0027 he told a United Nations panel in 1985.\u0027I feel that we need to have a top-level, coordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over the Earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors in a friendly fashion.\u0027He added: \u0027For many years I have lived with a secret, in a secrecy imposed on all specialists and astronauts. I can now reveal that every day, in the USA, our radar instruments capture objects of form and composition unknown to us.\u0027Miklos said Cooper often told him stories of UFO sightings and believed a lot of the world\u0027s technological advances had been passed on to governments by messengers from alien planets.Cooper even designed his own miniature \u0027UFO\u0027 based on an alien design he claimed to have seen.          Using special \u0027long range detection equipment\u0027 Cooper was asked by the US government to look for \u0027nuclear threats\u0027 - which likely meant Russian submarines or nuclear missile sites. But Miklos says Cooper - an avid treasure hunter - also noted the positions of Caribbean shipwrecks while he conducted this spy mission, and created a map on his return to Earth. The shipwreck hunter claims long time friend Cooper gave him the maps - which included detailed charts and exact coordinates  Miklos said Cooper often told him stories of UFO sightings and believed a lot of the world\u0027s technological advances had been passed on to governments by messengers from alien planets          Producers Ari Mark (top left) and Phil Lott (top right) with treasure hunter Miklos, host of Discovery Channel\u0027s \u0027Cooper\u0027s TreasureBut as for Cooper being a UFO \u0027nut job\u0027, Miklos couldn\u0027t disagree more.He described him as a \u0027close friend\u0027 and \u0027father figure\u0027 who was of \u0027sane mind\u0027.\u0027I can tell you one thing for sure, there was a lot of conspiracy theorists and UFO nut jobs that he wanted nothing to do with,\u0027 said Miklos.\u0027Just because he had actual encounters with something that he couldn\u0027t explain and other encounters to which he did have an explanation for, but he wasn\u0027t going to go and befriend all of these crazy different types of groups.\u0027In the early days he wasn\u0027t going to overstep the bounds of what he could reveal out of fear of getting killed (by the government) and what good would that do. So he kept a lid on it, he kept a lot of it quiet until later in his life.\u0027So the man I knew wasn\u0027t a whack job, he wasn\u0027t hallucinating and he wasn\u0027t making things up to gain attention, that wasn\u0027t him.\u0027He truly believed in what he saw and he tried to tell it in such a way to make people believe it and he knew because of his background in NASA as a rocket scientist that he was more credible than most.\u0027Nevertheless, Cooper was often discredited for expressing his beliefs on extra-terrestrial activity, but Miklos added: \u0027As serious as I\u0027m talking here right now with a clear mind to you, that\u0027s who he was.\u0027He was an honest, straight forward inidual who only wanted to investigate and explore the possibilities of the unknown, even if it meant risking his professional career.\u0027The next episode of Cooper\u0027s Treasure airs this Friday on the Discovery Channel at 9pm (PST) "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/12/05CCFAF9000007D0-0-image-m-51_1533814459345.jpg","title":"Who Muthuvel Karunanidhi","story":"When the DMK entered the electoral fray in 1957, despite the party being unrecognised, Karunanidhi won in the Kulithalai constituency. After the DMK’s first election, Karunanidhi was promoted as the treasurer of the party in 1961 and became deputy leader of the Opposition a year later.Under Annadurai’s leadership, the party came to power in 1967 and Karunanidhi became the minister for the public works department before being made the Chief Minister after the leader’s death.Karunanidhi continued the work of his predecessor: Annadurai’s desire to transform Centre-state relations and resist anything that could infringe on the Tamil Nadu’s prerogatives, keeping enough power within the state and so much that the integrity of the country as a whole would be maintained.However, in 1974, Karunanidhi’s DMK government passed a resolution in the Tamil Nadu Assembly that urged the Centre to make ‘immediate changes in the Constitution of Indian to establish a truly federal set-up with full state autonomy’.

And I was so sad, because I wasn\u0027t sure my parents supported a theater career.\u0027Wanting to please her  parents, Earhardt enrolled at Florida State University to study orthodontics. But \u0027in my heart, I was drawn to PR,\u0027 she wrote.The debutante and Alpha Delta Pi sorority sister said that changed to broadcast journalism after a trip to New York with a church group.Earhardt said she\u0027s woken up at 3am to wait outside the Today show to hold up a bright pink sign that said \u0027Will you marry me Matt Lauer?\u0027The then-college student even appeared on the Today show when Al Roker spotted the pink poster board proposal. She told Extra that Roker had \u0027made this big joke about will you marry this girl, and he said \u0027yes.\u0027 \u0027And he said, \u0027I want to register at Tiffany\u0027s.\u0027  Earhardt joined Fox \u0026amp Friends as co-host in 2016, pictured with fellow cohosts Steve Doocy (left) Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade (right) in New York in January          Seasoned pro: Earhardt began working for the network in 2007 and has been a frequent contributor and substitute host on Fox \u0026amp Friends (above with Brian Kilmeade, Steve Doocy and Kris Jenner in October 2014)This was many years before Lauer was fired from the show after he was accused of sexually assaulting and harassing several female colleagues.  Almost a decade after her proposal to Lauer, Earhardt found herself sitting in Roger Ailes\u0027s office, overlooking Rockefeller Center, interviewing for a job at Fox News. \u0027All I could think was how did I get here?\u0027 she wrote.Earhardt joined the network in 2007, soon landing her own slot, \u0027Ainsley Across America,\u0027 on Sean Hannity\u0027s show, before she became the host of a new morning wake show called Fox \u0026amp Friends First in 2012. She joined Fox \u0026amp Friends as co-host in 2016.It was that year that women began coming forward to accuse Ailes and others at the network of sexual harassment.But in her decade at the network, Earhardt said she\u0027d never seen any such behavior. \u0027I\u0027ve never been in a situation like that, thankfully,\u0027 she wrote. A fellow anchorwoman at the station, Deborah Knapp, described Earhardt as \u0027very loyal\u0027 and \u0027naive\u0027. \u0027I can see how she wouldn\u0027t be aware of that,\u0027 she added.

I have this wonderful schedule where I work full-time and also get to be a full-time mom.\u0027She admits she knew little about politics until joining Fox, but her conservative, traditional Christian views match those of its viewers.Earhardt said that wanted to better reflect both sides of the aisle, and had even invited Hillary Clinton on the show during the 2016 election - although Clinton had always declined.She said that wished there wasn\u0027t so much ision in the country. But in the next breath, she complained about the backlash Fox often receives from Democrats and liberals over its partisanship and failure to hold the president to account - often ignoring negative stories about Donald Trump or quickly changing the topic to something more on topic for Fox fans, such as immigration. \u0027I feel like the left wants to destroy Fox News,\u0027 she said, adding that the feeling wasn\u0027t mutual.When asked if Fox wanted to destroy the left, she said: \u0027I don\u0027t feel I do.\u0027\u0027I think that makes America wonderful, that we have different opinions.\u0027She also doesn\u0027t believe that biased or partisan shows like Fox contribute to the country\u0027s polarization.

While the group was having fun, smoking marijuana and playing music, she said she walked to the back steps and started speaking to God.\u0027I want this void in my life filled forever,\u0027 she said. \u0027I want it filled with you.\u0027 After that she stopped drinking and began writing \u0027love letters\u0027 to God in her journals.Now living in New York\u0027s Upper East Side with her second husband and daughter, she says she is hoping to have a break from work to spend some time with her family.But says, \u0027if God tells me to write another book, then I will.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/12/05CCFAF9000007D0-0-image-m-51_1533814459345.jpg","title":"National Lottery results Lotto numbers Wednesday 8 August","story":"    One lucky National Lottery Lotto player may just find themselves £10.8 million richer after Wednesday\u0027s drawingFind out whether you\u0027ve won. National Lottery Lotto results drawThe National Lottery Lotto numbers for Wednesday, 8 August are as follows: 8, 19, 20, 27, 31 and 34.

The Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust report concluded: \u0027It is clear from the evidence that Nurse Abdullah was treated unfairly\u0027Mr Abdullah \u0027should have known that signing the petition was not appropriate\u0027, the independent report said, however it noted that none of the other 18 signatories was disciplined for their involvement. Writing the letter was also \u0027a mistake\u0027, according to the report.\u0027However, the evidence indicates that Nurse Abdullah wrote it for a specific purpose and intending only Nurse X to see it,\u0027 it added. \u0027This may have been naive but we found no evidence that it was malicious.\u0027During the disciplinary process, the investigating officer \u0027failed to disclose evidence which was critical of her but which tended to exculpate Nurse Abdullah\u0027, the report found.The trust \u0027should consider the implications for the investigating officer\u0027s integrity and, ultimately, her suitability for her role as a senior member of staff\u0027, it added.A disciplinary hearing took place three months later on December 16 – a delay the report described as \u0027troubling\u0027 – and Mr Abdullah was dismissed by email on December 21.The investigation also criticised a report produced by a senior HR manager after Mr Abdullah\u0027s death as a \u0027whitewash\u0027 which \u0027served to reassure the trust that it had handled the case with due care and attention\u0027.Professor Orchard said the trust accepted the findings and recommendations of the report. It has also commissioned an overhaul of how disciplinary processes are managed.He said: \u0027I very much regret that Amin is not here to be offered an apology for the mistakes that we made and a personal commitment from me that we will act on all of the learning from his case.\u0027A coroner at an inquest held last year ruled Mr Abdullah had \u0027killed himself while the balance of his mind was disturbed\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/23/4EE985ED00000578-0-image-m-68_1533681396602.jpg","title":"ITV launching streaming app new 15 minute shows compete Netflix Amazon Prime","story":"    A new streaming service can be watched exclusively on smartphonesOriginal content will include sitcoms, dramas, reality shows and documentaries, but not live TV. It is hoped the service will launch by Christmas of 2019. NewTV has raised £780million from investors and is led by Jeffrey Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney\u0027s DreamWorks Animation, and Meg Whitman, the ex-chief executive of Hewlett Packard.Mr Katzenberg reportedly once offered £58million to the creators of the popular US drama Breaking Bad to make three more episodes which would have been released in short segments online over the course of a month.

The Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust report concluded: \u0027It is clear from the evidence that Nurse Abdullah was treated unfairly\u0027Mr Abdullah \u0027should have known that signing the petition was not appropriate\u0027, the independent report said, however it noted that none of the other 18 signatories was disciplined for their involvement.

So what can Sam Wolfson, a man nearing 30, wear to keep the sun off his head?In 2011, Banana Republic launched an official “Mad Men” range aimed at customers nostalgic for a more stylish time when they could drink so much before 2pm that they needed a nap. The centrepiece were those classic Don Draper hats: feathered fedoras and crumpled trilbies you could doff to your lift attendant. There was even a straw fedora, perfect for disappearing to Los Angeles for two weeks without telling the wife or kids where you were.The range was a huge success, selling out completely, and the company’s annual reports started to sing about rising revenues. Banana Republic released new Mad Men collections for the following three years. But, today, its UK website has only a single hat for men – a wool felt baseball cap.Indeed, it now seems as if the Mad Men fetishisation was the final hurrah for the man’s formal hat. An item that, a century ago, was as essential as trousers and shirts is close to death. It has entered a fashion black hole. Male celebrities have almost entirely stopped wearing hats, and those who still do really shouldn’t. Johnny Depp looks as if he is about to compere a slam poetry night in Tunbridge Wells, while Olly Murs looks as if he has been trapped in a children’s cartoon.Summer is the perfect time to shelter under something large and floppy, but when I went into 10 major menswear stores at a Westfield shopping centre, in London this week – not one sold any hats apart from very casual iterations: caps, beanies and bucket hats. (Topman had a baker boy hat, somewhere between a flat cap and a Kangol beret, but it makes you look as if you are about to serve up school dinners.) Looking ahead to autumnwinter, it is the same story at trendsetting brands such as YMC, Ami and APC, which don’t have any non-casual hats as part of the new season’s ranges.Caps and bucket hats have dominated Lanvin and Christopher Raeburn catwalks recently – and they were certainly on display everywhere in Westfield. The bucket hat re-emerged a few years ago on the hyper-stylish Swedish rap scene called cloud boys, after being sported by the scene’s leading light, Yung Lean. His fashion-conscious fans all began wearing bucket hats and the look spread to US rap, before becoming available at Urban Outfitters.But like so much of the current vogue for 90s sportswear, while the bucket is cool, it looks ridiculous on anyone over 21. You can probably get away with caps and beanies until you are 30, but after that you look like an undercover cop trying to bust secondary school drug dealers. So what are you supposed to do after that? Are hats out of the question?This is a particularly important question for me because, as a bald man, hats are not just an accessory but a necessity. In the sunshine, my head sweats and peels. In the cold, each gust of wind feels like a dementor frenching my scalp. I’m 28, so on the verge of no longer being able to wear baseball caps and beanies. I would love to graduate to a smarter hat, but every time I try one on – for a wedding, for example – I feel like the sort of person who takes a guitar to the beach.I speak to a couple of fashion experts who agree that formal hats conjure up unpleasant associations. Daryoush Haj-Najafi, a menswear writer and lecturer, says trilbies make him think of “Bacardi adverts”. Estefania Hageman, a stylist for menswear magazines, says the cap’s rise and the formal hat’s decline is part of a wider shift towards street culture. Skate brands such as Palace and Supreme dominate, while rappers such as Travis Scott and A$AP Rocky have become fashion icons. “We’re living in a moment that’s pure domination by hip-hop,” says Haj-Najafi. “The baseball cap is a New York item – hip-hop is from New York.”Virgil Abloh is a leading light in men’s fashion who started outside the fashion world, working with hip-hop artists such as Kanye West and Skepta, designing tracksuits and trucker hats. In six years, he has gone from Chicago DJ to the creative director of Louis Vuitton. “He’s taken items like the tracksuit and baseball cap and made them high end and desirable,” says Hageman. Now even CEOs are wearing baseball caps – it’s the everyman look.” Essentially, men’s fashion now is about a lack of formality and caps fit into that, but trilbies don’t. A hundred years ago, a hat was essential everyday wear for men, rich or poor. Photographs of football matches in the 1930s show every supporter wearing a hat. As styles became more relaxed after the war, hats fell out of favour for everyday, but were still a mainstay of fashion and celebrity – Michael Jackson’s black fedora, the Thin White Duke’s wide-rimmed boater, the ska scene’s adoption of the pork pie and the Notorious BIG’s Kangol 504 flat caps and berets. Even late in the early 00s, tween pop stars such as Justin Timberlake wore ridiculous hats as part of their effervescent sex appeal.So, how were formal hats turned from an absolute necessity to an eyesore? Much of the blame has to be pinned on two men: Pete Doherty and Neil Strauss. Strauss is the author of The Game, a book that reports on and proselytises for the pick-up-community. Pick-up artists believe men can learn techniques that will make any woman sleep with them. One such technique is “peacocking” – wearing a few items of garish clothing to get you noticed and give you something to talk about. Hats were a big part of this, and became emblematic of a certain kind of sleazy nightclub-botherer – someone who would affectedly drink whiskey sours and lightly gesture toward the groin in the belief that they were subconsciously making women think about sex.At the same time, the hat was having a real resurgence on the indie rock scene. Doherty led a small battalion, with Alex Zane, Peanut from Kaiser Chiefs and assorted members of the Australian band Jet bringing up the rear. Hedi Slimane, then the head of Dior Homme, was obsessed with Doherty and, together, the two men reimagined the male silhouette as something svelte, in tight jeans and a leather jacket, with a big protruding hat on top.Over time, places such as Camden in London and the Northern Quarter in Manchester became overrun with men leering about in a trilby. That’s how the hat has become unchic: 10 years ago, it recalled a time of Madison Avenue manliness or troubadourish artistry. Now, it recalls a time when lads at V Festival with fags hanging out of their mouths were shouting: “Imogen, babes, don’t storm off like that!”It wouldn’t be so bad if caps and beanies were a reasonable replacement. But most beanies look ridiculous (especially in summer) either too large or too small. Baseball caps are structured awfully, with big jutting rims that make you look like a train driver. I have a few that I love, including one from Weekday that I have bought three times and lost three times already, but it’s not easy.Still, there are some nascent signs that the baseball cap might be entering a stylish new phase. Arket has light seersucker versions, which its head of menswear tells me “compliment our idea of the everyday uniform” by focusing on “soft and natural materials”. You can see what he means - it’s a cap you could imagine wearing to a posh lunch. Cos and Topman are already stocking brimless versions – and there is a kind of workmanlike smartness to them, the sort of thing you could wear into your mid-40s and get away with.Dior Homme’s spring collection for next year, which is inspired by formal wear, includes extremely smart baseball caps with ornamental buckles. The trilby, the fedora, the pork pie: there is no hope for these hats unless you want to repel your friends and lovers. But perhaps the smart hat’s return could come through the backdoor left open by sportswear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0511ac795d0d59eafb1ff13a931fe27d0c576d03/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1799ff53d83b64a5f6ec3e06b7b97bf8","title":"puke pasties and poo the secret stinky world of cinema ushers","story":"They sign up for pick’n’mix and free films, but have to deal with rutting teenagers, rotting food and cups of excrement. Who knew the movies were so gross?Cinema’s real superheroes are not the vigilantes in Lycra who caper around on the big screens, but the underpaid employees stalking the aisles armed only with popcorn sweepers. Each season presents ushers with distinct challenges. At Christmas, parents use cinemas as a creche as they go present shopping come spring, they let their Easter-egg-stuffed offspring vomit in the cup holders but the six-week summer holiday stretch is the most intense, when a combination of boredom and blockbusters turns everyone feral.A decade ago, I was part of a teenage cohort working for minimum wage at a small cinema in Cornwall. I learned many valuable lessons, such as how to answer the question: “What do you mean: ‘It’s sold out?’” with no trace of sarcasm. I learned about the toxic powder that could turn liquid sick into a scoopable solid. I discovered that humanity was even richer than the green (The Incredible Hulk), moneyed (Sex and the City) and melodramatic (Mamma Mia!) tapestry on screen. There were ways of making life easier, such as reminding tourists used to chain multiplexes that our films actually started at the time advertised. Telling sweet old ladies where a period drama was set meant they didn’t wait until the end of the credits to find out, thus hastening their exit and allowing us to clean up sooner. Not that fans of The Duchess made much mess compared with the Iron Man aficionados.Other behavioural oddities were less preventable: as well as “sold out”, “reserved seating” was apparently a difficult concept to grasp. Like most cinemas, we turned a blind eye to food brought in from outside. But we had to enforce a specific ban on pasties, which aren’t only messy, but also smell uncannily like BO. This made asking customers whether they were smuggling in a large Rowe’s steak pasty an awkward conversation – maybe they just had poor hygiene. I once found an empty seafood platter under a seat and felt for the neighbour of whoever sat there slurping down whelks like wet, fishy popcorn. On witnessing a blowjob in progress in the back row, I sprinted down the hallway to ask the manager what to do. “Stop them, obviously!” I legged it back: it was all over. Never had I been so grateful for the speedy satisfaction of teenage boys.But after speaking to a crop of current and former ushers, I think we got off lightly. One employee of a Hertfordshire cinema shudders to recall a recent “week of bodily fluids” that left staff capable of identifying a comprehensive range of effluents at a glance. Gary from Manchester explains that the ushers would often consume the sweets that customers left behind, but never the drinks. “Not after the time we found that someone had left behind a hot wee in one Pepsi cup and a steaming shit in another. Was Transformers: Dark of the Moon so interesting that they couldn’t have left to go to the toilet?”You sign up for a cinema summer job envisaging free films and pockets stuffed with stolen pick’n’mix, not, as a distressing amount of ushers lament, confronting cinemagoers’ desire to poo anywhere but the toilets. As if bringing a baby to the cinema weren’t antisocial enough, some parents change their nappies in a screen. “As I was hurriedly collecting filth for minimum wage, my foot knocked against something weighty under a seat,” says Rory, also from Manchester. “I reached under, picked it up and held it up to the light. I realised I was holding a used, full nappy. I can confirm that we provided baby-changing facilities.” The environmental catastrophe that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson tackles in San Andreas pales in comparison with the used sanitary towel that Holly from Letchworth Garden City found after a screening of the 2015 disaster movie.People have been misbehaving at the cinema for as long as cinemas have existed. Patrons of the silent film era had to be reminded to remove large hats and were asked not to whistle. “We’re not observable in the dark, so we feel less inhibited in a variety of different ways,” says Cary Cooper, a specialist in organisational psychology. “You think you can get away with totally inappropriate behaviour that you wouldn’t do if it was light.” It is worse in “island cultures” such as Britain, he says, where we are “more inhibited to confront people about their breaking of the norms”.Every week, listeners write in to Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo’s BBC Radio 5 Live Film Review to complain about cinemagoers contravening the code of conduct that the pair created in 2010. (“No rustling”, “no slurping”, “no shoe removal”, etc.) “I think it was probably linked to the explosion in mobile phone use,” says Mayo. “I’ve been in films where people have been taking photographs of the crowd – with flash – during the film. All these kinds of things wouldn’t have been possible or thought of a few years ago. It’s the digital revolution that has changed everything and I think that’s the fuel behind the rage we tap into every week.”Mayo wonders whether cuts in cinema staffing have led to a rise in unchecked bad behaviour. “The very thought of an usher coming in and telling people to be quiet or put their phone away – it would be incomprehensible.” The code is intended as a stand against slipping standards, even though he knows that most of the show’s listeners conform to Cooper’s bystander effect, seething silently rather than confronting offenders.One type of cinema delinquency has a more complex social history than simply chucking popcorn around. “Just as the cinema generated new opportunities for working-class courtship, so did it have a similar impact on queer culture,” writes Matt Houlbrook in Queer London: Perils and Pleasures of the Sexual polis, 1918-1957. When homosexuality was illegal in Britain, many gay men held clandestine assignations in cinemas. “Indoors yet public, commercial yet open, music halls and cinemas sustained a sexual culture unlike anywhere else,” writes Houlbrook. “None of the outdoor locations where men found sex were as safe. In none were the sexual opportunities as concentrated.”Wishing to escape parental scrutiny but lacking the cash for hotels, teenagers also made a sexual sanctuary of the cinema. “Mothers of America  let your kids go to the movies!” Frank O’Hara wrote in his poem Ave Maria. “They may even be grateful to you  for their first sexual experience  which only cost you a quarter  and didn’t upset the peaceful home.”A chilling number of ushers mention finding sex toys – some still packaged, some not. Knickers and used condoms are regularly left among the popcorn crumbs. One usher recalls a colleague finding a bloodied teenage girl in the toilets. “She was physically OK, although maybe emotionally and mentally scarred.” Rough sex in the seats had caused her partner’s foreskin to tear. “He was, reasonably so, panicking. When we said we had to call the ambulance and even their parents, they freaked out even more. Turns out they weren’t dating – he was her boyfriend’s best mate.”One way of tackling cinematic misdemeanours, says Cooper, would be to turn up the lights a bit. But where would be the fun in that? It is possible that highlighting the poor ushers left to pick up your popcorn (or pants) might deter patrons from acting up, he says, citing the success of similar safety campaigns on motorways. “It does inhibit that behaviour when you make it human.”So, this summer, try your best not to subject the underpaid ushers to horrors beyond having to watch Hotel Transylvania 3 eight times a day. Arrive on time, put your mess in the bin and, for God’s sake, use the toilets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2bb98dccaee8e709dd23b89c1ddd5461fa1dce3/0_177_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=800ae9c2f4335d94be15948b80d705ae","title":"premier league preview watford 2018 2019","story":"Javi Gracia is a rare recent Watford manager who starts a new campaign having ended the last one, but his side lack firepower and have failed to win away since last November writers’ predicted position: 18th (NB: this is not necessarily Simon Burnton’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 750-1For the third time in four seasons, bookmakers and the ’s football writers are united in the belief Watford will be relegated. Despite never being seriously threatened by demotion at any point since they returned to the top flight in 2015, neutrals have never been convinced that the club’s manager-munching model looks like an appropriate blueprint for long-term survival. Sooner or later, of course, they are likely to be right, and on the eve of their fourth successive top-flight campaign there are reasonable grounds for concluding that this will be the year they finally fail to confound the naysayers.If there is momentum to be carried forward from the end of last season, it is very much of the downwards variety. That campaign ended with a run of one win and six defeats in nine matches, safety having been effectively secured with equally unconvincing back-to-back 1-0 home victories over Everton and West Bromwich Albion in late February and early March. Meanwhile Watford scored two goals in their last 12 away matches, with no goals and only one point on their travels after 2 January.There was mitigation for much of this, most convincingly an appalling injury record that led to the recruitment of a new medical director in January to, in the words of the club’s chairman, Scott Duxbury, “get us back to where we should be in terms of player care and treatment”. They are not there yet: Abdoulaye Doucouré, Gerard Deulofeu, Nathaniel Chalobah and Tom Cleverley, first-teamers all, have managed not a single minute of pre-season action between them, though all but the last may declare themselves fit for Saturday’s season-opening fixture against Brighton.This negates some of the benefit of having a squad entirely unaffected by the World Cup. But an unbeaten pre-season in which the majority of the players have been fully involved – all six of the incoming transfers so far announced were completed by 5 July – and overseen for the first time in five years of near-constant managerial churn by the same coach who ended the last campaign in charge, promises some benefits.The squad is overstuffed with underwhelming andor unreliable defenders – the likes of Brice Dja Djédjé, yet to make his league debut two years after signing, and the perma-crocked Younès Kaboul – but in Craig Cathcart and the excellent Christian Kabasele the defence has a reliable and experienced core, with reasonable if ageing reserves augmented by Ben Wilmot, an 18-year-old recruit from Stevenage.Adam Masina, who has arrived from Bologna, is expected to displace the referee-troubling Greek full-back José Holebas while the competition between Daryl Janmaat and Kiko Femenía for the right-back position has been complicated by the arrival of the versatile Marc Navarro from Eyol. Ben Foster has usurped Heurelho Gomes as first-choice goalkeeper, with the Brazilian now likely to depart, while the highly-rated 19-year-old Swede Pontus Dahlberg is being groomed to take his place. Assuming the injury record can be improved and the club can rid themselves of some of the chaff, this is all reasonably encouraging.Despite the loss of Richarlison to Everton, Watford’s midfield is both more solid and more creative than at any time in its recent history, with Deulofeu and another new arrival, Ken Sema, adding options in wide positions. Doucouré’s presence will be particularly celebrated: there was an assumption that he would move to a bigger club this summer, but despite his consistently excellent performances last season nobody came close to matching his asking price and he finally committed to a new five-year contract.“I agreed to stay because I can reach more objectives with Watford,” he said. “The club has the same ambition as me. We can reach another level. Maybe we can reach the Europa League or the top 10 of the league. That’s why I chose to stay.”Though results were poor Roberto Pereyra and Étienne Capoue ended last season in exceptional form, and if they can reach similar levels Watford have an outstanding midfield capable of driving Doucouré, last season’s top-scorer with seven in the league, towards his lofty goals. But like so many of the team’s attacks, a positive analysis of the squad falters when it reaches the forwards.Having preferred a single striker for most of his time in England, Javi Gracia has favoured a partnership in pre-season. In his final friendly, against Sampdoria, Troy Deeney, who appears to be approaching this campaign with improved fitness and focus, and Andre Gray, who has had an unusually prolific summer, played together. Last season Deeney started 20 games and scored only twice from open play, also converting three out of five penalties, while Gray’s 16 starts yielded five goals. One offered reasonable technique but little speed, the other a little speed but poor technique, and both suffered in isolation.This is where the trouble lies. Deeney has made a magnificent contribution to Watford’s recent successes but his impact has faded the longer he has spent in the Premier League, from a combined total of 20 goals and assists in 2015-16 to 14 the following year and seven last season, while Gray has not been able to recreate his free-scoring lower-ision exploits. Even if Gracia believes the pair are capable of providing the goals the team will need to flourish, they require capable alternatives should injury strike or form falter. As it stands they have the unreliable Stefano Okaka and Adalberto Peñaranda, the latter a fine prospect who blotted his copybook when falling out with Málaga last season because of an apparent belief that training was optional.The Venezuelan is only 21 and may be re-energised by this new challenge but in his last two seasons, both spent at Málaga, he has started 12 games and not scored. Frustratingly Watford have for over a year owned a decent solution to their problem, in the shape of the exciting young Colombian Cucho Hernández, but he remains on loan at Huesca until he earns either a work permit or gets a European passport.The abundance of resources in other areas makes the fragility of their forward line all the more striking. If over the final hours of the transfer window they manage to secure the kind of player who can be relied upon both to contribute to build-up play and icily convert any chance the likes of Deulofeu, Pereyra and Will Hughes manage to conjure, Watford should be confident of defying their critics once again. But with no such signing their prospects dim alarmingly, and perhaps fatally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09865bfca6a3916215098e2d1e17d1eac72647e7/0_103_3584_2150/master/3584.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ebb0ea1a3d59d5f7453aad53c2822c","title":"the big premier league preview football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and John Brewin for Football Weekly’s bumper preview of the 2018-19 Premier League seasonRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Yet it can often feel like contemporary academia is more about chasing citations. Most academic work is shared only with a particular scientific community, rather than policymakers or businesses, which makes it entirely disconnected from practice.Take my example. I research how to mitigate the social impact of hydropower dams. My core paper on this topic has been cited three times so far. I read in the promotions guidelines at my university that if I want to be promoted from assistant to associate professor I need to accumulate significant citations. As a result, I have now published a paper in which I reviewed 114 definitions of a current academic buzzword, circular economy, to propose the 115th definition of this term.I wish the academy would incentivise scholars to improve society, not chase citations. I want us to reimagine a PhD that is designed not to win kudos within the academic community, but rather aimed at discovering something new that will be useful for practitioners and have real social impact.This new PhD would see students go out into the field and talk to practitioners from day one of their research, rather than spending the first year (or more) reading obscure academic literature.Students would then co-create the content of their theses with their supervisor as well as practitioners in their field of research.Instead of labouring over every sentence of a 100,000-word dissertation locked away in an office, PhD students would share a concise 2,000-word draft with those practitioners to collect targeted feedback. They would finish their PhD when they have made a difference in the real world.It’s time to disrupt the current PhD system to make it better for early-career researchers. We need to move away from a self-referential culture in which academicstalk only to their peers. Confucius said one of the core principles of the academy should be as follows: “The essence of knowledge is, having it, to apply it”. Reminding ourselves of this may help to fix the broken PhD machine.Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

She posts them to her Instagram. Here are a few of the best ones.Yann: “Alexandre and I met on Facebook through friends. We then talked on Skype for two months and we fell in love. Alexandre was kicked out of his house and he came to live with me and my family. My parents were not aware that we were in love or that I was gay. But my mother guessed it, because we were looking at each other lovingly. One day she searched my room and found all the letters we wrote each other. In my family, we don’t speak about our feelings. She had a hard time accepting it. The day she gave me her blessing, I immediately asked Alexandre to marry me. We got married two weeks ago. We are the second gay couple to get married in Elbeuf!” Alexandre: “I decided to take Yann’s last name. I am completely estranged from my family except for my father, but he died in April. I was brought up in a foster family who I’ve since taken to court for mistreatment. And when I finally went back to my mother’s house, she ended up throwing me out because I was gay. Today, I am at peace. With Yann, I feel confident. I love Yann’s body and his childish side. I am always doing little things for him, like every night, I pour him a bath with candles, and I bring him breakfast in bed. We want at least four children.”“At the time, there was no mixed couple in Dunkirk. One day, we even got arrested by the police because he is black. My mother rejected me and wanted to send me to a correctional facility. So I left home with nothing, just my purse. And when we wanted to get married, the first priest we asked refused, saying black people were like cockroaches. We’ve loved each other for 53 years. And people now fight to get into the Caribbean nights we organize!”“I was Jeanne’s neighbor. I lived right there, the fifth house on the right. When her husband died, I offered to help her mow her lawn. I was married with children and she had a little girl. I would address her in the formal form, ‘vous’. Nothing happened for 10 years. One day, I declared my love. And it happened. I left my house. Even after we had slept in the same bed for a month, I was still calling her ‘Madame Dufeutrel’. She died two months ago. She was the love of my life. In the morning, we would listen to the radio and dance together in the kitchen. I go to the cemetery every day to talk to her.”“He had the reputation of being a great charmer. All the girls wanted him. He would always go out with end-of-the-line duchesses, or dancers with long legs. I, on the other hand, was a tiny girl with no money. He made accessories for a circus company, and I was an equestrian performer. I would go naked on the horse’s back, stand on it, or ride sidesaddled. I fell in love with him because I wanted security. But it turned out to be the opposite: he harassed me mentally and physically, and denigrated me as an artist. I directed comedians and acrobats, but he would go behind my back to tell them my artistic direction was all wrong. He would break everything I did. “I started telling people what was going on, and no one helped me. They would say: ‘But you have such a strong character.’ We stayed together for 17 years until one day, he tried to strangle me with the canvas I was working on and throw me out the window. I left him. “What he did was about having power over my role as a woman and as an artist – but never as a mother, which is strange. Our son understood everything that was going on he was the one that would bring me a glass of water after my husband would choke me. “I think I’m an inveterate romantic. I could fall in love so easily. I would love to raise a second child. I have been given the green light to adopt one.”“I always have been very well-behaved and really good at school. I am an only child. I was always a loner and concentrated on my studies. No boys, no friends. Just my studies. “I went to the village fair. There, I saw a man leaning at the bar, drinking a beer. He was classy he was beautiful he had style. We talked for hours. I wanted to see him again. I found out where he lived and went to see him. We fell madly in love. I was 17. He was 55. “The problem when you are 17 and that you fall in love with an older man is that you ask yourself: do I have a psychological problem? Do I have an oedipal complex? “I had no experience. He was my first love. Months became years. “We kept our relationship secret. When I was off at university and he came to pick me up at the train station, I would hide in the trunk of his car so that nobody would see us. Until one day, I was walking hand in hand with Jean-Pierre in a nearby town, and I bumped into my father. My father said: ‘It’s easy. It’s either him or me. If it’s him, you take your stuff and I don’t want to see you anymore.’ I moved in with Jean-Pierre and didn’t see my father for seven years. I am younger than Jean-Pierre’s kids, but they’ve always accepted me. “At 25, I started feeling unwell. Breast cancer. Breast removal. Chemo. It’s metastatic cancer, meaning the cancer will always be there. It will never heal. I start receiving treatment. We open a restaurant. Two years later, my bones are hurting. And there it is: bone cancer. I start another round of treatment. Ever since I turned 27, there have been ups and downs. I’ve undergone intense chemo and I am in a trial program. Last year I almost died, and I told him, if I survive, let’s get married. I did. We got married in an old washhouse. I could die at any time. But there is this phrase that I’ve told myself ever since I got sick: ‘I have lived it’ – I have lived that love. That emotion with the person you love, that butterfly feeling in your stomach, that beating heart, that feeling of going to pieces or of being so strong. If you don’t feel that, what is life worth living for?”“I lost my wife last November. Her name was Marie-Jeanne. I met her at a village ball. We didn’t live in the same town, so I would write her letters all the time so we could meet up every weekend. I would talk to her about mundane things, if I had a cold, for instance. I would write that I kissed her tenderly. She was a simple girl just like me. A girl from the countryside. We were together for 47 years. I loved her.“Marriage is like a business. I built the house. She cooked and raised the children. One of them is mentally disabled. He lives in a special center. When they told him his mother had died, he cried. “I thought that when he would come back to the house, he would look for her everywhere, open the doors, like he used to do. But he didn’t. He didn’t ask for her. He knew. “She’s buried in the cemetery down the village. I still have to put her stone marker with her name, the year she was born and died. I am also going to add a little cross. “There are moments where I really get depressed, when I am really low. Oh la la, you can’t even imagine. I miss her. She was a good cook because she was from the Landes, where there are a lot of good cooks. “In the winter, we would watch television, then sit near the fire and fall asleep in our respective chairs. We were happy. I always hoped it would last forever. It didn’t. “Please forgive me if I cry.”“I named my cabin ‘The Villa of the Ones Deprived of Love’ because I was the least favorite child in my family. It used to be that in farmers’ families, there were maybe six children. They would send the one they loved the least out into the mountains to herd sheep. And that was my case. They had very obvious preferences – especially Mom. But moms do what they can. “How do you survive that? First, you have a terrible adolescence. It was endless. I was in pain. I was shy. It was not a place for teenagers. I would come back to the village once a week, get some bread and go back to the mountain with my donkey. I would miss everything: the balls, all the activities. “But then you adapt. And I was happy. I have dedicated my whole life to the sheep. And I don’t regret it at all. “I am not mad at my parents. “I have a daughter. She is 22. Until she turned 14, it was wonderful. Then, for some reason I can’t explain, she rejected me. We haven’t spoken in 10 years. I am really disappointed. “I don’t like humans. They are twisted. When I see what they are capable of, I am ashamed. I would have rather been a dog. That is why I work with animals. And I love waking up every morning. “I am with Katia now. She is from Paris. She is a good person. I met her when she was 17 and I was 25. She was my employee. She loved me, but it wasn’t reciprocal. I was with someone else at the time. And we spent 30 years without seeing each other. But we met again and we got married 10 years ago. I never got married with the others. Why? Because they didn’t ask. She just had an operation, so she is in Paris, resting. Do I love her? I don’t know. Love is a weird word. I care about Katia. That must be love. She cares about me too – a bit too much. “She is the one I should have kept when I was young, because we could have done things together. But I was too stupid at 25. We could have had babies together. I am about to retire but there is no one to replace me. If I had had kids with Katia, one of them could have taken over and I could have retired.“I am going to have to sell my flock. I haven’t found anyone to replace me.”“I have never had any partners in my life. I have never kissed a girl. “It sucks, because I am 24. “I am not sure why. My mother was depressed – she didn’t give me any hugs, she did not like to give warmth to other people, and so I got used to it. For me, hugging people was not very normal, and I didn’t feel very comfortable with it. “I was once kissed by a girl she made the move. I liked it, but it was uncomfortable for me. I was 15 and I didn’t really know what to do. She did everything – she could have kissed a plastic object and it would have been the same. “To give a kiss is a more symbolic thing than to have sex. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with romance. It’s a mind thing. One side of me wants to have this symbolic kiss with that one person, the mother of my children. And there is the other side, the animal side, of me that says: ‘Oh I don’t give a fuck, just go into the club and fuck ’em all.’ But then I don’t do it because the first side is just stronger. I am too sensitive. “I think girls want a dominant, strong type of guy, not the sensitive guy who is too emotional, like me. I am always overthinking things. “I want to love one person. “I think I have waited for too long, now. I am afraid to fail. I have a friend of mine who I fell in love with two years ago. I was like: ‘I like you a lot,’ and she said she liked me too, but she had another boy, and she’s not a polygamist. She did not break my heart – it’s more like I broke my heart, I had big expectations and put too much pressure on myself. I wrote her a poem. I was proud of it, but I’ve never gotten the chance to give it to her. “Most of the time, I am happy. I am sad in the evenings. It’s sad to be alone it would be nice to sleep and wake up next to somebody and be like: ‘Good morning, it’s grey outside.’”“I moved from Syria to France to become a biological pharmacist and a jazz singer. I was working in a lab and this guy calls me to open the door. I will always remember how he was dressed: grey jeans, a camel leather jacket, a beautiful bag that he had bought in Poland – very stylish, very minimalist – and sneakers. For a year, I wasn’t interested, and then it just hit me. I would walk through the halls to bump into him, and I finally asked him out.“I remember our first kiss. I was sleeping at the International House and he dropped me off with his scooter. I kissed him quickly on the lips and ran away. I was thinking: ‘I did it!’ He told me he drove so fast after that. Six months later, we moved in together. “Nicolas was a brilliant man, very intelligent, too intelligent. He pushed me to sing. He would always tell me things I had forgotten about myself. He knew me so well. He loved to organize special moments for his friends. He had a truck because he was a surfer. One day, he decided to organize a cheese fondue dinner party in the truck! “He got diagnosed with cancer on 21 June 2014.“He wanted a child. I didn’t want one. It was a difficult decision, but I came to realize that if anything were to happen to him, at least I would have a memory of him in our child. “It’s the best thing we could have done. Sara was his ray of light. I am so happy he experienced being a father. “He wrote me letters. “He also wrote letters for Sara. He tells her about his life, his dreams. Profound thoughts about life. They encourage her to think about the meaning of life and encourage her not to be afraid of living – that to love is the most important thing. “Nicolas died on 11 April 2017. “Thanks to Nicolas, I am not afraid of anything. “He is a saint who came to spend some time with me. “He was my candle. “He was my guide.”“After 10 years with my ex-boyfriend, I posted on Facebook: ‘For our anniversary, we are giving each other a gift: we are separating.’ I signed up for a dating website. I met 40 men in one year. It was a great way to go out, dress up and feel pretty. “One day, Thierry contacts me. We talk on the phone at 4.30pm. At 5.35pm, we met for coffee. I was five minutes late. He came to my place the next day and he never left. “It wasn’t love at first sight with Thierry. His web profile was too perfect, and a lot of men had lied to me. He said he cooked he doesn’t. But he does do the cleaning. He tells me he loves me, that he thinks I am pretty. We can’t live without each other. It has been two years. “I want to do everything for him. All his problems are mine. I need to solve them. If I walk by him three times, I’ll kiss him at least once. I have never met a man who loves me like he does.“I will not blame him if it has to end. Because even if we only spend 10 years together, I know it will be intense and beautiful. I think life is worth it because I can give love. I don’t need to receive it. I had been married for 24 years. My ex-husband was depressed. I wanted to save him. I was so afraid to leave him because he was so sick. But I needed to go. Five years later, he committed suicide on the anniversary of our orce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2cc37b1a63e1fcaaffc4169799dadb2bf33410c/624_853_5570_3342/master/5570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1da2df34fa926edbf4eee64d63f4e73a","title":"daggy moving glorious why no one can be cynical at a celine dion concert","story":"Every moment with the vocal gymnast is so joyous and sentimental, it hardly matters she’s overlooked by the cultural eliteNo one who grew up in the 90s could have missed Céline Dion’s dominance of the charts, peaking with the decade-defining Titanic theme song, My Heart Will Go On. But like many inner-city queers, I’ve since gravitated to Dion more as a meme than a singer. Her unintentionally hilarious and deeply empathetic appearance on Larry King Live in the wake of Hurricane Katrina is still rolled out at parties and her zeitgeist renaissance as a newly minted fashion icon has rendered her iconic backwards tuxedo a distant memory.So, it is with an ironic love of camp, and more than a little cynicism, that I enter the Dion Dome. That cynicism, I soon discover, has no place here. It is impossible to remain disaffected and tragically hip among the tens of thousands of fans who are here to see their idol, after an 11-year absence from Australia. The most striking thing about Céline’s performance, and the huge, warm crowd she attracts, is that it is neither highbrow nor lowbrow. This is middlebrow fare in all its daggy, suburban glory – and it’s glorious.To enter the Rod Laver Arena, we are cattle-pressed through metal detector-wielding security guards who, at Dion’s request, have made anyone carrying a backpack or even a handbag check it in and reclaim it later. In a post-Manchester bombing world, Céline Dion is taking no chances.Once inside, I’m surrounded by gangs of motherdaughter teams, women in friendship clusters of all ages, families who have come together to bring their mums or grandmas to see Céline, and several supportive male hangers-on. There are, of course, pockets of gay men who remind me that the line between high camp and unashamed dagginess is a thin one at best – and it cuts across the deep ravine of Aussie nationalism when Céline covers John Farnham’s You’re the Voice. The night after I see her, during her final Australian show, Farnsy joins her onstage with a bagpipe player.A pair in front of me captures my attention for a large part of the night: a mother and her son, who wouldn’t be a day over nine, both of them belting out every word to hit after hit – from Power of Love to It’s All Coming Back to Me Now to Beauty and the Beast. Blessed are the nonjudgmental mums, for they shall inherit the spoils of their extremely well-adjusted sons. Every moment with Céline Dion is so pure, so joyous, so silly, so sentimental – from her lengthy banter between numbers, replete with physical comedy and Jerry Lewis-style buffoonery, to her anything-but-crocodile tears of gratitude at the end of songs.It’s the disarmingly hilarious patter that forms a huge part of Dion’s brand, that brings a sort of clownishness into her glamorous persona, separating her from other female pop stars from her era. In this way, she’s a throwback to the pop icons of yesteryear – a mix of Liza Minnelli, Peter Allen and Liberace.  At the centre of it all is an artist who understands intensely who these people are, why they have come to see her, and how to transport them into her alternative universe. And it is an alternative universe. Amid the vocal gymnastics and French-Canadian clown shtick that have made Céline a household name, one observes an extraordinary absence of politics, or even aphoristic messages of self-empowerment. The closest we get to anything even resembling inspiration porn is when Dion maniacally decrees, “Life is beautiful! We have to laugh, I LOVE TO LAUGH!”This absence of inspirational or realpolitik is, of course, extreme privilege at play. Dion has been inside the bubble of wealth and fame since adolescence. When Beyoncé uses her stadium tours as a platform to pay homage to the Black Panthers, it’s not a design choice: it’s her reflecting back the ongoing struggles of people of colour around the world. Dion has been inside the bubble of wealth, whiteness, fame and uber-progressive Canada since adolescence. So Dion favours the personal over the political. In the most baffling and endearing part of the evening, we are treated to an eight-minute monologue about Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds that is so off the wall I would expect to see it at a performance art scratch night. By the time she brings up the topic many in the audience have been expecting – the recent death of her husband and manager René Angélil – we are ready putty in her hands.Dion and Angélil were married for 22 years, and their relationship was the butt of many jokes (Dion grew up around Angélil, who was 26 years her senior), but when she brings him into the show she drops the goofiness to deliver a powerful moment of truth. Dion is an empath, and there was no brave face or celebrity manoeuvring in her public grief for Angélil. Now we are witness to it in person, and as she talks about him, despite the cavernous arena, it feels as though she’s right beside you. Dion doesn’t dwell, but acknowledges the grief via a song, Recovery, written for her as an offering of condolences by the pop star Pink. “Mourning the loss of my husband, I received a gift from an amazing artist and wonderful mother,” she says. Pink, who is also in Australia right now, occupies a same-same-but-different place in the suburban pop star firmament as Dion. Both are overlooked by the cultural elite but have huge pulling power in Australia – thanks in large part to their winning combination of sentimentality and authenticity.That combination is no more evident than when Dion moves seamlessly to All By Myself, the Eric Carmen song that has become unmistakably hers. This is the Dion of the early-to-mid-90s, who pumped out daggy mum-rock ballads, like Meatloaf but minus the masculinity and minus anything remotely rock’n’roll. Here, in Dion’s alternative universe, what was once daggy is now ine – and as she belts out the final big notes of this lament to loneliness, after letting thousands of us into her loss and grief, I leap out of my seat to applaud. Any cynicism I entered with has melted off entirely.

After photographing the construction of a new castle for Victoria and Albert at Balmoral, his startling images show how glaringly bright the new-build was, became the Queen’s official photographer in Scotland.May, who has been collecting vintage photographs since his earliest days touring with the band, now owns one of the largest collections in the world of Victorian stereo photographs, double images which sprang into 3D life when seen through a special viewer. Surviving viewers are now rare and very expensive, so he had to design and manufacture modern versions in plastic to include with a series of books he has published from his collection, which also featured in an exhibition at Tate Britain in 2014.He describes the new book as a “labour of love”, a tribute both to the photographer, and the text by his mentor Roger Taylor, confusingly not Queen’s drummer, but an expert on Victorian photography and Wilson’s work.“I collected George Washington Wilson’s stereo cards over the years and have always been excited by his unique portrayal of Scottish landscape in the stereoscope,” May said.Taylor said that in the mid-Victorian period Wilson was a household name. “Above all he was universally acknowledged as a leading exponent of stereoscopic photography, a fashionable craze which fired up hearts and imagination throughout the nation.”In his early years as a landscape photographer, Wilson walked miles across mountain sides carrying his heavy equipment and setting up his studio in a tent, something he blamed for his later poor health.His success led him to construct what was described as the most advanced purpose-built photographic centre in the world, near his home in Aberdeen. When it was gutted by fire in 1882 Victoria sent a telegram of sympathy from Balmoral. He retired in the late 1880s, leaving his sons to take over the business, and died in 1893.May’s appearance at the book festival is likely to be a slightly more decorous affair than when Queen played Edinburgh in 1982. The hall was so packed and hot that Freddie Mercury helpfully poured some beer over the sweaty front rows, commenting: “I didn’t know this was gonna be a bath house.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4f86d9a2f8082763db2042917f8c7c099433c39/1817_481_2540_1524/master/2540.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ce121bbc21b3375ef8dfdca2d90cc5","title":"how matteo salvini pulled italy to the far right","story":"After years on the fringes of Italian politics, the populist leader of the Lega has stoked anti-immigrant panic and barged into power. By  Alexander StilleWhen Matteo Salvini – Italy’s interior minister and the country’s most popular politician – climbed up on the stage last month at the annual meeting of his party, the Lega, he looked out on a sea of green. Many of the party members were wearing green T-shirts, and some had even dyed their hair green. Green is the colour of the flag of Padania, the independent nation, named after the Po Valley, that Salvini’s separatist party (formerly known as the Northern League) has long proposed creating to secede from the Italian state.This year, however, the message had changed. A new slogan, “Italians first!”, had replaced the old secessionist battle cries. Blue flags – the Italian national colour – mixed with the green, and Salvini stood at a blue-and-white podium in front of a blue backdrop. The enemy was no longer Rome, but Brussels, international banks and multinational corporations. This was Salvini’s doing: in four years as its leader, he has turned a movement of regional separatism into its seeming opposite, a nationalist party.As a result, the Lega’s annual meeting at Pontida – where a confederation of northern cities signed an oath in 1167 to halt the invasion of Italy by Frederick Barbarossa, the German Holy Roman Emperor – had the spirit of a victory celebration. “Four years ago on this stage,” Salvini told the crowd in early July, “you probably shared my own doubts: people thought the Lega was finished.” Instead, he continued, the party had spread its message far beyond its old northern base. “Who would have thought we would be part of a winning coalition in Molise and Sicily? That we would win in places like Siena, Viterbo, Pisa and Terni?”“While we are standing here, the third boatload of slaves in a single month is not arriving in Italy, but heading in another direction … From Pontida the warning has arrived for the human traffickers, as for the mafiosi and camorristi: the carnival is over.” La pacchia è finita (“the party is over”) is one of Salvini’s favourite phrases, and it could be found on the T-shirts of many Lega members at the Pontida rally. Attacks on migrants (and Islam, gay marriage and criminals) have taken the place of separatism in the Lega’s rhetoric. When Salvini was a young city councilman in 1999, he refused to shake hands with Italy’s then president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, saying: “No, thanks, you don’t represent me.” When Salvini was elected to the Italian parliament in 2008, he arrived in Rome in a T-shirt bearing the words “Padania is not Italy”.Then in 2012, prosecutors discovered that the Northern League’s treasurer had misappropriated some €40m in public money, and that hundreds of thousands of euros had gone to the Bossi family. A party that had run on the slogan of “Roma, ladrona!” (“thieving Rome”) had been caught out in the basest kind of corruption. Money had gone to pay for renovations of the Bossi home, a luxury car and a phony university degree purchased in Albania for Bossi’s less-than-brilliant son, who was being groomed for a leadership position.Salvini managed to wrest the party from Bossi and the old guard, dropped the word “Northern” (against their wishes), and embraced nationalism. What propelled the Lega from the margins to the centre of Italian life was a combination of Salvini’s shrewd political instincts and a perfect storm of external events. A first sign of that change came in 2014, when Salvini acknowledged that he would be rooting for the national football team – a big concession (believe it or not) for a Lega leader.The battle cry at his demonstrations was no longer the exploitation of the north by the rest of the country, but immigration, Roma encampments and the indifference of the European Union to Italy’s problems. His first big rally featured a banner saying “Stop the Invasion”. In 2015, he took a risk by organising a major rally in Rome – unusual for the Lega – and took the stage with leaders of neo-fascist groups, against the advice of older Lega leaders, who were vocally anti-fascist. Salvini brushed aside the criticism as a small price for creating a broader, national message. “For tender-hearted journalists and leftists, the problem is 10 rightwing kids reading a pamphlet,” he said. “For me, the problem is the thousands of illegal immigrants stealing, raping and dealing drugs.”Salvini, like the leaders of other insurgent populist movements, has made highly effective use of social media. If Donald Trump has Twitter, Salvini is the king of Facebook. In the second half of 2015, Salvini tripled his Facebook following: capitalising on the refugee crisis and growing discontent with Matteo Renzi’s centrist government, he added nearly 400,000 followers in just six months. At the time, the Italian edition of Wired magazine reported that Salvini posted an average of 10 times a day, “doing in a week what his competitors do in six months”. Since then, his following has increased more than fivefold, to 2.9 million.The magazine found that Salvini’s following often spiked after he made an especially provocative statement – such as declaring, in 2016, that the pope’s welcome to immigrants would “encourage and fund an unprecedented invasion”. But another Wired study found that Salvini has become increasingly sophisticated in the last few years, stimulating positive feelings as well as the usual negative emotions of anger and fear. “The rhetorical strategy is clear: you lower the reader’s guard by playing on fear and anger, but also suggesting that, by putting faith in the Lega, things will get better,” the magazine concluded. “There is a positive element to his posts, even a bit of joy.”However, the old message is still loud and clear. In a post this month, Salvini wrote: “A 25-year-old girl was attacked in the Milan train station, saving herself from RAPE only through use of pepper spray. The rapist was arrested today, let’s hope this time he finds a judge who keeps him in prison for years. P.S. I am not allowed to tell you that the rapist is Nigerian, an illegal immigrant with a criminal record, or I will be accused of RACISM.” (Salvini declined to mention that the victim of the attempted rape in Milan was herself an immigrant, who was returning home at 5am after working a night shift.)In spite of his hard line on immigration and inflammatory rhetoric, Salvini has actually presented himself as a softer and more approachable figure to most Italians. This impression has been aided by the contrast with Bossi, the Lega’s founder, who carried himself like a barroom brawler, threatening to punch protesters at public rallies and making free use of obscenities and insults. In 2001, Bossi said he only used the Italian flag to “wipe his arse”. Salvini, on the other hand, comes across as the nice guy who lives down the block. He is known for giving blood and organising blood-donation drives, and makes frequent references to “mamma” and “papa”, to goodness and generosity.“Matteo is very human,” says Lucia Borgonzoni, a Lega member of parliament and the new minister of culture. “He is very approachable, likes to be with people, takes as many pictures with people as they want. Not because he has to, but because he likes it. As well as political ability, he has real human qualities. Matteo transmits a sense of hope.”Salvini has skilfully deployed this double persona for political gain. In 2014, Salvini made a provocative visit to a Roma encampment on the edge of Bologna, after Borgonzoni, then a city councillor, had been slapped during an earlier visit. (Salvini had declared he would happily take a bulldozer to Roma shantytowns, so the Lega was understandably unpopular there.)When Borgonzoni and Salvini arrived, their car was predictably surrounded by protestors, who began banging on the windows, while one demonstrator jumped on the front of the car as it began to drive away. “The driver started to speed up because these people were genuinely violent,” Borgonzoni recalls, “but Matteo told him to slow down, he was worried that the young man might get hurt. That’s Matteo. He cares about everyone. Meanwhile, our critics on the left did not condemn the violence – saying, ‘They asked for it. What did they expect?’ As if violence against your opponents is somehow different than other kinds of violence.”Above all, it was good politics. The incident depicted Salvini as a tough guy, but with a kind heart – unafraid to visit a Roma camp he had promised to bulldoze, but avoiding violence and even being a victim of aggression. Images of the attack on Salvini spread quickly, and won him another 10,000 Facebook followers in a single day.Salvini moves deftly between online and offline politics: his Facebook page boosts the turnout for his appearances, and posts videos of his speeches and interviews to build up his online following. The young heads of his social media team are integral to Salvini’s success: they were often present at the most important political meetings, including those in which he negotiated the Lega’s partnership with the Five Star Movement.Although Salvini cultivates a strongman image, he alternates soothing traditional Italian references to love, friendship and family with harsh attacks on his enemies: criminal immigrants, mainstream journalists, financial and cultural elites, faceless EU bureaucrats and bankers. He addresses his Facebook followers as “friends”, but makes frequent use of the term “enemy” as well.“Populist groups always have to have an in-group and an out-group – an ‘us’ and a ‘them’,” explains Nicoletta Cavazza, a political scientist at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. “Salvini managed to keep the basic structure of the Lega discourse, but shifted the ‘us’ to all Italians – and he substituted Rome with Brussels, so the enemy was no longer southerners, but immigrants.”Salvini’s rise to power has heightened concerns in Italy about the escalation of racist and xenophobic violence in the country. Dozens of attacks on black people and Roma have been recorded in the last year, all over Italy, from Treviso in the north to Gioia Tauro in the south, including Florence and Rome. The attacks range from drive-by shootings with air guns, in which the attackers were reported to shout “Salvini!” to the assassination of a Malian trade unionist campaigning for fair pay for migrant workers. An Italian athlete of Nigerian descent, Daisy Osakue, the Italian under-23 champion discus thrower, was hit in the eye by an egg thrown from a car. Police have been pursuing attackers and making arrests, but the government has been more reticent. After a torrent of criticism for his anti-migrant policies – culminating with the headline “Get behind me, Salvini” on the cover of Italy’s largest Catholic magazine – Salvini responded with a favorite phrase of Mussolini: “many enemies, much honor.” He also insisted that the idea of widespread Italian racism was “an invention of the left”.Others worry about an increasingly ugly atmosphere. A judge in Milan described how she had been harassed by a car full of Italian men, who shouted at her and followed her after she gave some loose change to a Bangladeshi selling flowers near her office. “What are you doing?” they yelled. “These people are a nuisance and need to leave, and you give them money. Basta!”But the Lega’s Lorenzo Fontana, now the families minister, insists that the only racism is one practised against Italians who dare to think differently about immigration. “Racism has become an ideological weapon,” Fontana wrote on Facebook, “used by the globalists and their slaves (some journalists and mainstream commentators, certain parties) to point the finger at the Italian people and falsely accuse them of every kind of dirty business.”Salvini’s brand of populism is not without precedent in Italy. The Lega Lombarda, the original Lega founded by Bossi, was a protest party against the corruption and fiscal overreach of the government in Rome. In the late 1980s and early 90s, it captured a growing popular anger and disillusionment with a system that was labelled Partitocrazia – “rule by the parties” – in which the politicians in power ided up the spoils and bribes for government contracts to finance their parties, and often, to line their own pockets.The Lega’s rebellion against the system helped set the tone for the major anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Clean Hands, whose findings led directly to the dissolution of the Christian Democratic party and four other satellite parties that had traditionally made up Italy’s coalition governments during the postwar period.Ironically, it was a major beneficiary of this system – the TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi – who rode this populist wave to power in 1994. Like Trump, Berlusconi perfected a style of billionaire populism, a super-rich and super-successful man who spoke in the plain, often crude idiom of the man on the street, bragged about his wealth and success with women, and promised to make all Italians as rich as he was. He railed against the country’s cultural and political elites, and promised to substitute his northern-Italian business knowhow for the corrupt inefficiency and bureaucratic red tape of the professional politicians in Rome.Berlusconi gained power by shrewdly allying himself with Bossi’s separatist Lega Nord in the north, and with a nationalist far-right, post-fascist party, the National Alliance, in the south. He stole Bossi’s populist thunder and co-opted the Lega by giving the “anti-system” party money and positions of power in his governments. Of course, Berlusconi’s populism proved to be entirely phony. He was inept at governance, and more interested in protecting his own private interests than reforming Italy’s economy. He left in place – and exploited to the hilt – the patronage system that the old parties had created and Italy’s economy consistently performed worse than virtually all 28 countries in the European Union.Over 25 years, Berlusconi alternated – and sometimes shared power – with the main centre-left party. The merry-go-round of coalition governments, of infighting and compromises among the country’s leaders, created the impression of a political world that was principally concerned with its own preservation rather than the growing problems of the country as a whole.This set the scene for a new wave of populism, incarnated by the Five Star Movement, now Salvini’s partner in government. Five Star is the brainchild of an unlikely alliance between Grillo, the foul-mouthed comic, and a cerebral internet guru called Gianroberto Casaleggio. Grillo had built a large, faithful audience for his standup performances, which skewered corrupt Italian politicians, greedy bankers and multinational corporations, and sometimes featured bizarre conspiracy theories about cancer cures and the dangers of vaccines being covered up by pharmaceutical companies. Casaleggio correctly intuited that with a blog and a well-run interactive website (run by his company in Milan, Casaleggio Associates) Grillo could become a political force. The blog, which was set up in 2005, attracted millions of visitors, and morphed into the Five Star Movement in 2009.The two outsider parties – Lega and Five Star – ran in the March 2018 elections not as allies, but competitors. Salvini ran in a centre-right alliance with Berlusconi and a couple of far-right, neo-fascist parties. Both Lega and Five Star describe themselves as being “neither left nor right”. Salvini’s followers are decidedly Trumpian, while Five Star attracts disaffected people from across the political spectrum, including younger and better-educated left-of-centre voters. The party has always emphasised environmental issues, clean energy and alternative transportation, and opposed plans for high-speed rail lines through environmentally fragile areas.However, both parties were sharply critical of Italy’s ruling establishment, while also promising to maintain most of the country’s generous social programmes. Both were highly critical of the EU and the euro, and cast a fond eye toward Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.Events played into their hands. As Libya fell into chaos, the number of desperate refugees hoping to reach Europe by boat increased exponentially. In 2014, Salvini’s first year as party secretary, there was a huge jump in the number of people entering Italy from north Africa – from 42,000 in 2013 to 170,000 in 2014, reaching a peak of 181,000 in 2016, a year in which 5,000 people drowned trying to make the crossing.That same year, some 157,000 Italians left the country in search of a better future. While these two migrations are not connected, for many Italians this all feeds into a gut feeling that their country is heading in the wrong direction. Salvini’s great political achievement has been to turn this discontent against the enemies of his choosing: migrants, the EU and Italy’s political elite.Renzi’s centre-left government passed a “jobs act”, which was supposed to boost employment by giving employers greater flexibility in hiring and firing. This had only a small impact on employment, but increased the number of young people hired on a temporary basis, often with low salaries. Many young Italians live with their parents well into their 30s, too economically insecure to marry and start families. “You need an element of certainty to start a family,” says Massimo Garavaglia, a senator for the Lega and undersecretary of finance in the new coalition government.While stopping boatloads of refugees from north Africa may satisfy an emotional need to restore a sense of order to immigration, it doesn’t change the basic demographic arithmetic, which shows that Italy actually needs a healthy level of immigration to survive. Last year, 664,000 Italians died, while only 464,000 Italian babies were born – 100,000 of those were of mixed couples, with one Italian parent and one foreign-born one, according to Istat, the national statistics bureau. If the country is going to maintain something close to its current population of 60 million and have enough working people to keep its pension system afloat, it will have to add to its population. Most of Italy’s immigrants are young, arrived legally, and are working and paying taxes. Both the Lega and Five Star jumped on the immigration issue during the election campaign. Luigi Di Maio, the 32-year-old leader of the Five Star Movement – who is deputy prime minister together with Salvini – attacked the NGOs who were rescuing refugees at sea and bringing them to Italy. “Who pays these taxis in the Mediterranean?” Di Maio provocatively asked.And while Salvini and Di Maio say they have nothing against legal immigration, they seem dead against most means of encouraging it. Salvini vehemently opposed the “ius soli” bill proposed by the previous centre-left government, which would have given citizenship to children of immigrants if they were born in Italy or arrived at a young age and did their schooling there, and at least one of their parents had been in Italy legally for five years. The Five Star Movement, deeply conflicted on the issue, decided to abstain from voting, effectively killing the bill.Despite the increase in immigration in the past 15 years, Italy’s crime rates have actually gone down – but crime is much higher among illegal immigrants, who often live in makeshift quarters, hang out and sleep in parks and train stations, and are hired to do irregular or illegal work that can range from hawking counterfeit designer knockoffs to selling drugs.The EU’s policy – or lack of policy – has only made matters worse. “The European Union made a huge mistake in selfishly leaving Italy alone to contend with the refugee crisis,” says Pier Giorgio Ardeni, director of the Cattaneo Institute, a social science thinktank in Bologna. The EU rules were that the countries receiving immigrants had the duty to sort out those who qualify for political asylum from those who do not. This meant the burden of the massive uptick in refugees fell mainly on Italy, Greece and Spain – all countries contending with major economic problems.The Italian government and the EU agreed to pay €35 a day for those willing to house refugees. A few communities have used these funds wisely, to fix up abandoned housing and reinvigorate towns that have lost residents in recent years. Others, however, have housed refugees in substandard dwellings and pocketed most of the money. “Do you know how much I make with immigrants?” one of the chief defendants in the prosecution of mafia corruption in the Rome city government said to an interlocutor in a wiretapped phone conversation. “They are worth more than drugs.”Salvini cannily anticipated and took advantage of the crisis. He began hitting out against the EU well ahead of the Brexit vote. He had the political intuition (or luck) to back Trump when other European politicians – including Berlusconi – recoiled in horror. Salvini travelled to Philadelphia to meet – and, importantly, to be photographed with – Trump in April 2016, before he had secured the Republican nomination. “It’s the triumph of the people against globalisation, against the mainstream press and the big economic interests,” Salvini declared after Trump’s victory.While defying calls from the Roman Catholic church to welcome immigrants, Salvini avoids direct confrontation and insists his policies are perfectly consistent with church doctrine. “The catechism,” he said again at Pontida, “says rich nations should welcome strangers within the limits of the possible. In Italy, we have reached the limits of the possible. We apply the catechism by opening Italy’s doors to women and children who come here legally on aeroplanes, but no more men on rubber dinghies. We will help them grow up and work in their own countries. Let’s spend in Africa the money that needs to be spent.”One of the big questions of Italian politics is how this odd-couple marriage between the Lega and Five Star will work. Although the Lega is technically the junior partner in the alliance, having far fewer seats in parliament, Salvini has stolen the spotlight from his fellow deputy prime minister Di Maio. (The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, a virtually unknown constitutional law professor, was a compromise solution.) Five Star’s founder, Grillo, insists he wants nothing to do with electoral politics and has delegated the day-to-day running of the party to Di Maio, who has only about five years of political experience.Five Star’s representatives are almost all relatively new to politics. They are often better educated than the Lega leaders, and more likely to have university degrees, but less experienced in the hard-knock world of practical politics. Moreover, Five Star was born out of a deep distrust of traditional politics, and its representatives (they dislike the word “leaders”) have taken a vow to withdraw from electoral politics after only two terms in office. This would mean Di Maio being unable to run for office after this current parliament – at the age of just 37. Salvini, by contrast, has been in politics for 25 years, and appears in it for the long term.“The Five Star Movement is a thin, virtual party that exists mostly on social media,” says Flavio Tosi, the former Lega mayor of Verona. “The Lega by contrast is rooted in the territory, has competently governed many cities and regions, and has developed a leadership class.”In forming their heterodox coalition, Salvini and Di Maio hammered out a “contract” for their government, agreeing on several key ideas. “There are things we have in common, and at the same time, the Lega has certain rightwing ideas that we don’t share,” says Maria Edera Spadoni, a Five Star member of parliament and vice-president of the chamber of deputies, Italy’s lower house, who worked as a flight attendant before she began attending Five Star meetings in her home town of Emilia Romagna in 2009. “The beauty of the idea of a government contract is that it lays out what we have both agreed to, and leaves out the things on which we don’t agree: certain environmental issues, gay marriage. Certain civil rights will not be touched.”Few experts see these proposals as workable, or capable of producing long-term growth. “These proposals to abolish the Fornero law and to institute a flat tax are pure demagoguery,” says Ardeni, of the Cattaneo Institute. Significantly, the new government has put those proposals on hold while it attends to other business. For the moment, the government says it will only apply the flat tax to businesses, not iniduals.If the new government struggles on the economic front, the temptation will be to push “identity” issues, which cost nothing, but rally the troops. Salvini has already proposed placing the crucifix in every public place (not just in classrooms, where it already exists) in order to reinforce the country’s traditions. He has also pushed the idea of armed self-defence along the lines of US “stand your ground” laws, which permit the use of firearms in self-defence against an intruder. The Lega families minister, Fontana, proposed scrapping a law that bans hate speech, the promotion of racial discrimination and the advocacy of fascism – a proposal immediately rejected by Di Maio and Five Star. Fontana also caused a scandal by announcing there was no such thing as a “gay family”.In explaining his own conversion from fervent separatist to Italian nationalist, Salvini insists the common denominator is the question of identity and territory. “I was also drawn to politics linked to a territory,” he explained in an interview for a recent biography (Il Militante, by the journalists Alessandro Franzi and Alessandro Madron). “At school everything was left v right, communists and fascists what interested me was the discussion of identity, autonomy, federalism and community.” If he is a nationalist and not a regional separatist, he says, it is because the threats to identity have changed. Before, a centralised Italian state was eroding regional culture and language, and overtaxing the prosperous north. Now the threats to identity, in his view, are an overbearing EU, globalisation and out-of-control immigration.Others see Salvini’s about-face in a more jaundiced light. “I think his nationalism is a cynical calculation but from a purely Machiavellian point of view, it’s been masterful,” says Tosi, who was a rival to Salvini in the battle for leadership in 2013. “They don’t have the stomach or the ability to deal with the big structural reforms Italy needs, and so I think they are going to hammer away at the immigration issue. Immigration is the glue that holds them together. But if you can’t deal with the economic issues, eventually the voters will recognise that – and I don’t know what will happen then.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13ac1d6c95696bca81f141fd4036d15fe2f094c3/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84f055a94f095ac6b4d18bb3e2cbde8b","title":"im already stockpiling readers preparing for a messy brexit","story":"We hear from readers who have plans in place in case Britain runs out of food after a no-deal BrexitBritain could run out of food by this time next year if it cannot maintain the flow of goods after Brexit, the National Farmers’ Union has said. After it emerged that the government was drawing up plans to stockpile food in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the British Retail Consortium and drug manufacturers issued more warnings about possible supply shortages, we asked for your views.About 300 readers got in touch, with more than half saying they had already started stockpiling or were seriously considering doing so, and the rest sharing their concerns about shortages after a no-deal Brexit. The most popular food items people wanted to store were staples such as flour, olive oil, dried pasta, rice, powdered milk, coffee and tinned items such as tomatoes and sardines. Many readers also highlighted “luxuries” such as chocolate, and there was mention of stocking up on over-the-counter medicines such as painkillers and antihistamines.Many respondents acknowledged that people would have to be in a relatively privileged position to be able to plan ahead. Here are some of your reasons for stockpiling and views on the practicalities of putting together an “insurance policy” in the larder.I am trying to do my best to avoid political rhetoric and look only at facts. While I still have faith that the people behind the politicians, the civil servants, industry leaders, lawyers and indeed the administrators of the EU are working hard to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the facts around reverting to WTO regulations leave me concluding that April 2019 could be a very sensible time to be self-sufficient, so I’m already stockpiling.My first purchase was an additional shelving rack for the garage and several plastic storage crates, to ensure the “Brexit supplies” are kept separately to everyday food. Each time I go to a supermarket, 2-3 times a week, I am doubling up on all non-perishable or long-date items and throwing a few extras into the trolley. So far I’ve bought mainly tinned goods: soup, different types of beans, tuna and sardines, chopped tomatoes. Also, jars of olives, capers and lots of dried pasta. I plan to spend around £100 a month until we know more about what might happen in March. The chest freezer will be filled with meat, but at the moment I’m looking to ensure we have the absolute basics rather than luxuries. I have also bought flour, yeast etc and will endeavour to learn to bake bread. I have bought ibuprofen, toothpaste and toilet paper as part of doubling up on non-perishable goods. In the event that food supplies are not affected, I will donate any stockpiled items to food banks. So far, my one “luxury” touch is three-packs of Boost chocolate bars at £1 each and with long dates.I am very worried about a no-deal Brexit, while also acknowledging that the chances of this are remote, despite what Liam Fox may publicly utter. I liken it to the tech billionaires who have bought up land in remote parts of New Zealand in case of global nuclear war: the probability is tiny, but the consequences are truly terrible, so it is worth a proportionately small investment in insulating oneself. Adam Roberts, 35, LeedsThere are too many people who seem to have forgotten about (or are too young to remember) the late 1970s and early 80s – 3 million unemployed, serious economic dislocation, and riots stemming from deprivation mixed with a simmering frustration and fury at an out-of-touch government.We also seem to have enough idiots at the helm who are quite willing to drive this country off an economic cliff-edge, knowing that they personally have good financial cushions to land on and who really aren’t bothered about the “collateral damage” they’ll inflict on others. Plus I don’t think they really understand the practicalities of how goods, including food, are distributed andor stored these days. I mean, what exactly is the government going to stockpile and where? I don’t believe this country has the capacity to stockpile any serious food supplies. David Bates, 54, BermondseySince the day of the advisory referendum I’ve been more keenly aware of the need to prepare, but what really kickstarted it was headlines about the government starting to stockpile. It comes down to a simple question: do I trust the government to take care of my family in the event of a crisis, or do we need to take responsibility ourselves? The way I see it, we still have a little time to get a head start on things.Even if nothing happens from Brexit, it’s handy to have a month or two’s supply of tinned food in the house in case we get snow like last year, or you’re ill or lose your job. There are plenty of situations where it’ll come in handy. The key is to only store what you enjoy eating, and actually use the stockpile, don’t just shove it in the shed and forget about it. I’ve got cartons of passata, tinned tuna, carrots, potatoes, onions, pulses, water chestnuts, plum tomatoes, curry paste jars, coconut milk, tomato puree, rice, pasta, water, orange juice, squash, spaghetti hoops, soups, stews, tinned fruit, herbs and spices. I’ve also got a good amount of DIY tools, buckets, lightbulbs, matches, candles, firewood, bleach, Dettol, first-aid items and common medicines. It’s an insurance policy of sorts. I recognise that I’m in a fairly privileged position to be able to do this: not everyone can afford a few hundred quid on unnecessary tins. But I have to look after my family, and I would encourage everyone else to do the same if they can. If you don’t end up needing it, you can eat it or donate to a food bank, because God knows they’ll need it. If you do need it, you’ll be glad of it. Thomas, ShrewsburySo far Brexit proceedings have been disastrous, in my opinion, and I fear we have not yet seen the worst of it. Food shortages will only be one of many trials ahead of us and I have already started to stockpile tinned food. I normally don’t use much, but any port in a storm.I’ve got tinned veg, fruit, pulses, corned beef, spam, sardines, salmon – things I could put a reasonably balanced meal together with. Cordon bleu it won’t be! Healthy? Not overflowing with vitamins, but not bad. I’m too young to remember rationing, but living in the north-east of England in the 50s was not a land of milk and honey – people bought bacon by the slice and butter by the ounce from the dearly beloved Co-operative Stores, which sold food loose from sacks and barrels. People nowadays couldn’t cope with that. If I have to, I’ll dig up my garden and grow my own fresh veg. Fresh fruit is what I would miss most of all, and you can’t stockpile that. Anne Neale, 62, CullercoatsI am making the assumption that most locally produced goods will be fine but anything that comes from further afield will not. So I am planning to buy a two- to three-month supply of staples – pasta, rice, flour, pulses. I assume that British milk will be just fine, but will probably buy some powdered milk and UHT just in case. I will buy additional supplies of canned fruit and tomatoes, tea and coffee.I have been thinking about buying a small chest freezer and running a cable down our small back garden to the shed so we can stock up on frozen veg – broccoli, green beans, spinach – as well as frozen berries, orange juice and fish (guessing Cornish mackerel and Scottish will not be affected, unless all the fishermen decide to move to Spain). We buy our veg from an organic veg co-op, so fingers crossed they will carry on with their UK box. Lettuce is not freezable, so l will grow my own! Victoria Whitford, LondonThis is less theoretical for me than for some – I have started stockpiling, just a couple of items every week. Although I of course hope the nonsense in parliament will resolve itself, and better yet Brexit will be stopped altogether, I have a young son to support and can’t afford to be caught up in the panic buying that will undoubtedly occur when a no-deal is near.So far I am buying tinned food including beans and tomatoes, rice and pasta, tinned fish and bottled water. I will also buy tinned meat. I hasten to add I’m not a “prepper”, I’ve never done this before in my life and never saw myself needing to do so. But my family is too important to me for me to take such a risk. I only wish the politicians would think in the same way. Ed, 33, GloucestershireWe’ve been considering stockpiling for a while as part of wider concerns about food supply chain disruption and as part of a drive to ensure that we lower our household waste, making us more resilient as a household. Brexit emerged as a final prompt as it appears to be a credible trigger, at least for short-term supply issues.I am most worried about Brexit disruption in the initial period, assuming a no-deal (food and medicine primarily), but longer-term I worry about the diminishing opportunities for my children in this country and an erosion of the standards and (some admittedly imperfect) safeguards on food, manufacturing, workers’ rights and environmental standards.I also worry about the effect Brexit is having on our culture – it feels as though the toxicity it has unleashed and the resurgence of the far right is far from played out. I don’t think stockpiling will in any way protect us from those longer-term and chronic issues. It provides a bit of a comfort blanket, but no real aid. I’m not panicking about Brexit but I am taking it seriously.

Rent in refuges will continue to be funded through housing benefit. This will be warmly welcomed by survivors and our member services – housing benefit makes up, on average, around half of a refuge’s income.”An average of two women a week are killed by a partner or former partner in England and Wales. Ghose said refuges provided “a real lifeline for thousands of women and children experiencing abuse at home”.She said Women’s Aid would now work with the government to develop a system of national oversight for life-saving refuges.The charity Refuge said the proposals could have led to the collapse of provision of accommodation for women fleeing violent partners.Its chief executive, Sandra Horley, said: “Housing benefit is an essential source of income for women’s refuges. Previous proposals would have devolved this critical funding to local authorities, which have no obligation to fund refuges. This could have led to the collapse of refuge provision across the country a national travesty. Thankfully this disaster has been averted.”Horley urged the government to increase financial support for refuges to meet an “ever-growing” demand.Under the government’s revised plans, housing benefit will be kept in place for all those living in supported accommodation, believed to number around 716,000 people in 651,500 properties in Britain.The housing minister Kit Malthouse said: “Protection of the most vulnerable has always been our primary concern, and following our consultation the case for keeping supported housing in the welfare system became clear.”Ministers also announced they would work with providers, local authorities, membership bodies and resident representatives over the coming months to develop an oversight regime for the sector.The government is introducing a domestic abuse bill, which has recently closed to consultation. It is heavily focused on criminal justice measures and includes proposed powers to ban suspects from contacting alleged victims or from drinking alcohol or taking drugs. There are also plans to electronically tag suspects as part of a new civil protection order.The shadow housing minister, Sarah Jones, said: “Thousands spoke out against the ill-conceived proposals for supported housing funding which would have left some of our most vulnerable people without a safe place to stay.“But it begs the question why ministers put people through this pain and uncertainty in the first place. Three wasted years have strained our supported housing stock at a time when the need is higher than ever, a result of austerity and the disastrous roll out of Universal Credit.“The government must now urgently guarantee housing benefit funding and increase the provision of supported housing. Only this sort of decisive action could begin to make up for the delays and damage that has been inflicted on providers and people living in supported housing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2875c2817302c1934cad807f77fd24d655032d/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3ef91d72ba88e774eb4c6bab88230b3","title":"england v india second test day one live","story":"“Legal terminology,” says a subject line, ominously. “‘Ben ‘Stokes has taken the stand at Bristol crown court’,” it begins, quoting me from 13:57. “I highly doubt that Stokes is a defendant in an American court. He has gone into the witness box.” The signature says “Adam Roberts, sniffily”. It’s a fair cop – sorry, copper. The law is a bit like sport, isn’t it? If you don’t know the lingo, the people who do may show no mercy.“On the Pope front,” begins a Facebook message, promisingly. It’s from my friend Steven Lynch, of the celebrated Ask Steven column, which began on  Unlimited (email immediately if you remember that) before moving over to Cricinfo. “Have you noted the fact that he’s not the first Test-playing Pope? George of Derbyshire won one cap in 1947.” You won’t believe this, but it turns out that Ollie’s not even the second Test-playing Pope. “There’s also Roland Pope,” Steven continues, “who played one Test for Australia in 1884-85. He was basically the team doctor and cheerleader, but played in the second Test at Melbourne, one of 11 changes from the previous Test after a pay dispute. Batting at No 6, he made 0 and 3, so not a roaring success.” But still, a better debut than Graham Gooch.Never mind the brollies, we’ve got the Ollies. “On behalf of our community,” declares Oliver Pattenden, “I’d like to express a enormous amount of pride in the young Pope.” That is the acceptable face of the papal pun.“Ollie Pope may be the first Ollie to play for England’s Test team,” notes Steve Padley, “but I understand that Ollie Robinson of Kent has played for England Under-19s. I saw him make an excellent 115 for Beckenham v Tunbridge Wells last Saturday. Perhaps he could become the second Ollie to play Test cricket, given time.”“A further Oliver tidbit,” offers Mike Bennett. “According to Harry Altham’s book A History of Cricket (vol 1), Oliver Cromwell was apparently a keen cricketer in his younger days, although as he died slightly more than 200 years before the first Test, he might find it difficult to qualify.”It’s still raining at Lord’s. The dear old English drizzle is back from his holidays, feeling thoroughly refreshed. But Lord’s drains fast (it’s had plenty of practice) and there could still be some play after tea, so don’t go away. In fact, send us an email, especially – at the risk of sounding like the new supply teacher – if you haven’t put your hand up before.An email comes in picking up on our photo of the two Indian-supporting umbrellas (above, as these words are written). “It is quite possible that the Indian Government may throw these two to the cellars,” says V Krishnamoorthy. “There is a long list of what you can’t do with the Indian flag, longer list than the ICC code of conduct probably.”“Got to love the fact,” adds Pete Salmon, “that, as of now, there have been more Test players named Mpumelelo, Eldine, Krishnamachari, Faf, Warnakulasuriya, Pommie, Srinivasaraghavan and Lonwabo than Oliver.”“Most common names never to play Test cricket?” wonders Don Wilson. “Without running it through StatsGuru, I can’t come up with a Boris, a Jacob or a Nigel. Wouldn’t the world be a happier place if those three had gone into cricket instead of politics?” “International Ollies!” yells Mike Bennett. “Although Pope will be the first Oliver, there has been an Ollie who played Test cricket. Olive ‘Ollie’ Smith played 4 Tests for Australia Women: http:www.espncricinfocicontentplayer53570.html”That is superb. Especially as she made more stumpings than runs.While his team-mates twiddle their thumbs, Ben Stokes has taken the stand at Bristol crown court. We can’t comment on this but we can report it, and here’s the latest from my colleague Martha Kelner. “Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon, Simon McMahon. “The first Oliver ever to play Test cricket? ‘Knock Knock?’ Who’s there? ‘Oliver’. Oliver who? ‘Oliver clothes are getting wet, it’s pouring with rain at Lord’s’. I’m here all week, by the way.” Whatever you think of the joke, the single quote marks, ready to go within the double ones, are dead classy.“Most common name never to play Test cricket?” says Hugh Maguire. “Zhang Wei – apparently China’s current most popular name… Or do you want a less smart-Alec response?” This is . You’ll find no discrimination against Alecs here, smart or otherwise.An email from Nick Miller, fellow OBOer and Our Man at the Ground. “Update from Lord’s,” he begins, ever the pro. “The gods are teasing us as the skies very occasionally look a bit brighter, causing us all to peer out to see if it’s stopped. But the relentless drizzle continues. At the moment it’s the sort of rain you might just about carry on in, but wouldn’t start in. Despair.” That’s the spirit.It takes more than rain to stop Gary Naylor. “Re that 48-6,” he tweets, “you forgot to add Kohli 42*.” Ha. I didn’t want to presume that India would be batting, though it would be nice. In a perfect world, it would be against the rules for the same team to bat first in two back-to-back Tests. This is frustrating, isn’t it? Especially after the thriller at Edgbaston. Test cricket is such a great leveller, it even brings itself down to earth. Still, it could be worse – cricket, even non-existent cricket, has nothing on the tedium of Transfer Deadline Day.Time for some correspondence. “The OBO team are playing down in Brighton this coming Sunday,” says Joe Neate, “and due to a couple of injuries are looking a bit short for players. If anyone is around and fancies playing in a fun 4-team charity tournament with plenty of cricket, beer and potentially sun, feel free to reach out to me on joe.neate@gmail. All abilities welcome, we have a wide range, and it’s played in a great spirit. It genuinely is just about having a great day and all the teams play in the right way. We have equipment etc so all you’ll need is some white-ish clothes!”“Good Afternoon from Bangalore!” Good afternoon, Saiprakash. “I was hoping to catch some riveting action only to see the match delayed. I am a bit annoyed that it is 3 days too soon for India’s hopes.. :(”“Afternoon, Tim.” Afternoon, Bill Hargreaves. “Can’t be easy keeping waiting folks entertained, although I think Polly, Manuel and Sybil made a fine fist of it.” We need to talk about Ollie. England’s latest 20-year-old, Ollie Pope, is a likely lad, and a likeable lad, but he’s going to be thrust in at No 4, when he has never batted there for Surrey (regular No 6) or even the England Lions (No 5). He seems quite relaxed about this. Are you? Also, a bloke in a pub told me last night that Pope is going to be the first Oliver ever to play Test cricket. For any country. This seemed far-fetched, but has been confirmed by Stats Guru, which has various Olivers, none of them Test players. “Do you think,” Bloke in Pub went on, “there’s a more common name that has yet to make its Test debut?” Afternoon everyone and thanks Rob. It’s looking bleak but not hopeless. I have this from no less an authority than Matthew Engel, who has a ticket for the Edrich Stand and reckons “we will get some play, very late – finishing about midnight”. The Met Office (sorry, Pete Salmon, 11:10) has the rain relenting after tea, which might give us 20 overs under the lights, with whoever has lost the toss having time to make 48 for 6.The great Tim de Lisle will be your weatherman for the next couple of hours. You can email him or tweet @TimdeLisle. Bye!Legover department “You’re bang on about Johnners still raising a smile,” says Richard Marsden. “It’s the squeaky ‘he hit a four over the wicketkeeper’s head’ that always gets me. But from comedy to tragedy, the great shame about the whole story is that the epilogue is even funnier than the main event, but it’s been more or less lost as far as I can tell. This, from the  in 2001, summarises it:“‘Johnston was somewhat embarrassed by his loss of control and refused to share the box with Agnew for almost a year afterwards, for fear that eye contact would cause him to do it again. And indeed he did. Together again in 1993, Agnew passed him a letter to read out, one written by the (authentic) Mr William H Titt. Once again the duo dissolved helplessly, just at the time the teams were coming out onto the field, but this time they were rescued by colleague Trevor Bailey. According to Agnew, Johnston ‘had to be led away, squeaking and wheezing pathetically.’”“That clip featured in An Innings With Johnners but is no longer available on iPlayer, and I can’t find it anywhere else online. So here comes the appeal: Help me OBO Kenobi, you’re my only hope.”I think you can stream in on a popular electronic, commerce and cloud computing company website. “If anyone does attempt a pun of the Papal variety (John Starbuck, 11:16),” says Bill Hargreaves, “it’s possibly best to rely on the practiced retort.” Unsolved mysteries of the modern world, part 1 Why does Kumar Sangakkara call him David Malan?“Afternoon Rob,” says Matt Emerson. “I have a ticket for today, but I have been forced to go to the office due to deadline pressures, so is it - to coin a phrase - cowardly to pray for this rain to last all day?”I’m off to grab a coffee. See you in five minutes for more nothing.With light still falling, the umpires have decided to take an early lunch. And why not?“It looks on my (pretty reliable) app that we will have play from around 3pm-4pm,” says Jim F. “As for the toss: at Lord’s as soon as it is overcast or there has been rain you have to bowl first. The wicket won’t give you much on days four and five and with lots of overs likely to be lost will have less wear and tear anyway. So the best chance of 20 wickets surely means making the most of overhead conditions and swing when present. We’re not always that good at this admittedly.”Yes, a shorter game removes some of the risk of bowling first. That said, England will be conscious of the last Test against India on this ground, when they bowled first, bowled poorly and then batted even worse. If it looks like there will be at least 30 overs’ play today I might bowl first, but if it doesn’t start until tomorrow I’d probably bat.“I work in Baker Street (just down the road from Lord’s),” writes Pauline Peel, “and I can confirm that there’s no change in the weather - although it may (just) be getting a teeny bit lighter over the Barley Mow (in Dorset Street). There are quite a few of us in the office willing the rain to stop. Not sure our credit with the Almighty is all that good though!” “‘Precipitation is still occurring’?” sniffs John Starbuck. “Are you turning into Arthur Daley? It’s an odd kind of alter ego for a cricket writer but I expect it has some merits.”“Regarding Phil Sawyer’s description of post-married life,” begins Elliot Carr-Barnsley. “I can confidently assert, having also recently disappointed the remaining women of the world by getting engaged, that the scenario he describes is achievable at any stage of the relationship process.” Legal disclaimer:  Media Group does not encourage OBO readers to sit around in their undercrackers listening to TMS and trolleying booze if they want to remain betrothed for longUpdate Precipitation is still occuring in the NW8 postcode area.“Still sunny in Hereford and set to stay that way tillSaturday,” says Pete Salmon. “It’s a pig of a drive, but if the players and officials get the 13.03 from Euston they could be here by 16.14. The Edgar Street ground is just 15 mins from the station – play underway for 17.00 – we could get half a day in before it gets dark, make up time tomorrow, and then they can all catch the 19.50 back tomorrow. Sorted.”Yeah, but the regulations won’t allow it. THere’s just no bloomin’ commonsense in cricket. If you live outside the UK and prefer the audio version of ‘rain stops play’, Romeo has kindly sent in the overseas TMS link.Seeya then. No it’s fine, I’m not offended. Yeah, have a nice life.“While I agree that Duncan Fletcher was a genius of a batting coach, for me he also had an almost infantile obsession with pace bowling. Steve Harmison shouldn’t have played half the Tests he did while poor old Matthew Hoggard was unceremoniously dumped after a poor display in NZ.”I think Hoggard was dumped under Peter Moores. I know what you mean - I wish Martin Bicknell had played more Tests - but Fletcher has so much credit in the bank, and his obsession with pace helped make England pretty competitive away from home. “Congratulations to Guy Hornsby on his impending nuptials and all that,” says Phil Sawyer, “but some OBOers have blazed through the fiancée stage, screamed through the orce section and are now well into the ten years and counting sat alone in our pants listening to TMS sucking on ice lollies and falling asleep at the bottom of a bottle stage. Erm, so I hear…” “My dismay at the weather is being thoroughly tempered by the knowledge that my friend Nick is Ollie Pope’s bat sponsor,” says Richard O’Hagan. “Nick has been rubbing his hands with glee at the prospect of his logo being flashed to the watching millions when young Ollie strides to the crease. The cloud of gloom that will be hanging over him at the moment is definitely making me happier than a rain delay usually would.” On this day 27 years ago...I defy anyone to listen to this, even if it’s for the 471st time, and not smile.“Morning Rob, what a day to be Oli Pope, waiting for the clouds to part to make your bow,” says Guy Hornsby. “Sat up in Manchester preparing for my imminent nuptials on Saturday (yes, an OBOer with an actual fianceé), by which time I’m hoping we’ll have skittled India out for 180 after a monstrous 580 for six declared, with tons for Pope, Cook and Root (finally). That’ll be a decent wedding present, thanks. I’m a realist, so perhaps just escaping abject humiliation is more achievable. And hope we play alright in the cricket, too.”Oh crikey, I had no idea. Congratulations! The captains will have a tricky decision at the toss, even if it’s delayed until tomorrow morning. I’m 99.94 per cent certain they’d have batted first had the heatwave continued. There are only so many ways you can say ‘it’s still raining’. This isn’t looking good.“I like the thought that Henry reads so violently that he breaks the spine of the books,” writes Mike Daniels. “He’s one of three talented brothers and there’s high hopes for the youngest, Ethan. Henry might end up being sledged a la Mark Waugh (Best all-rounder in the world? Not even the best all-rounder in the family!). “Do readers send you cakes at all, a la TMS?” asks Bill Hargreaves. “I’d demand it.”I think we’ve had a few in the past, though a lot of the OBOers work remotely these days, and I’m not giving out my address.“11:16,” begins David Crowther. “‘Brookes is particularly exciting, though he’s out for the rest of the season with a stress fracture of the book.’ “What on earth is that, an injury known only to literary types?”Oh dear. Spot what’s swimming around my subconscious.“Sky have been discussing selection issues and Mike Atherton reckons that at this level the selectors are considerably more influential than the coaches,” says Brian Withington. “He feels that there is relatively little scope for technical development with Test players, so getting the ‘right ones’ on the pitch is the more important task. Interesting point, but not sure he is allowing sufficiently for the potential for a good coach (creating the right environment) to facilitate peak performance even with established players. Discuss.”Well, he knows slightly more about Test cricket than us, and I do agree that identifying which players will cope with international cricket is the most important thing for a selector or coach. But I do take your point. Duncan Fletcher, a genius of a batting coach, is a great example of the technical influence a coach can have, while Trevor Bayliss’s success with the one-day team demonstrates the importance of creating the environment you mentioned. “Can the captains change their final XI based on the conditions (drop the spinner for a seamer),” asks Saurabh Rye, “or have team sheets already been submitted?”They sure can. You don’t submit the team until the toss takes place.Prose, while u wait. Our old friend Steve Pye has indulged in a bit of masochistic nostalgia by looking at the highlights (sic) of English Test cricket in the 1980s. “Good morning (which it is this far north),” says John StarbuckOh lord no. My writing is bad enough without resorting to cheesy puns. As for young fast bowlers, there are a few with a lot of promise: Olly Stone, Henry Brookes, the Overton brothers, Matthew Fisher. Brookes is particularly exciting, though he’s out for the rest of the season with a stress fracture of the book.“Aaaaaaaaaarghhh,” says Pete Salmon. “I want the cricket to start!!! Can’t you do something?! Blazing sun in Hereford. What the hell is going on. Bloody Met Office.”I thought they only predicted the rain. They create it as well?No news is bad news: it’s still raining, it’s still miserable. The forecast suggests we may struggle to get any play today.Before play starts, if indeed it does start, please read this charity appeal on behalf of an extraordinarily brave 12-year-old.The toss has been delayed. It’s not raining heavily - it’s mizzle at worst - but the covers are still on.“A highish-scoring affair?” queries Richard Dennis. “Perhaps not. The average completed County Championship innings score at Lord’s this year is 225. It seems it’s a slightly different beast this season.” Interesting, thanks. For no particular reason, I still expect the first-innings scores to be around 350-400.Apparently the pitch is fairly green, which makes it more likely that England will pick Chris Woakes ahead of Moeen Ali as a replacement for Ben Stokes. India have a few things to consider: any of Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav and Cheteshwar Pujara could come into the team.Gary Naylor is in the house! Well, the pressbox“Looking like more off than on here today, even with the fabled drainage at Lord’s. If anyone is up for whiling away the hours between inspections with a bit of analysis of what made the first Test a great one (if not quite an all-time great one), I scribbled lots of words here.”Whiling away the hours? How many words did you write?Hello. The addict knows all about guilt about putting his cravings before the welfare of others. Was it not Trainspotting’s Mark Renton who said, ‘I appreciate what you’re trying to do, I really do, but I JUST NEED ONE MORE OVER OF ANDERSON TO KOHLI, YOU *!\u0026amp*’?No, it wasn’t, but had he done so he’d have spoken for many of us. With the possible exception of heroin, which I’ve yet to try, Test cricket is the most moreish drug of all. Yes, we know back-to-back Tests are a Bad Thing. Sure, burnout is one of cricket’s biggest problems. But never mind the bodies, minds and souls of 22 weary cricketers: there’s another Test match for us to enjoy!The first Test at Edgbaston was the best in this country since 2013. This match should - should - be something completely different: a highish-scoring affair on a pitch that will take turn as the match progresses. The heatwave means the pitch is expected to be very dry, although that heatwave is no more. The forecast for today is pretty poor. Of all the gin joints in all the world, it had to rain on this one.Play starts at 11am, with the toss at 10.30am."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaa7203ef2068120f9cc7f277fdf32e167d91099/0_350_5244_3146/master/5244.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94afdfeb2deb0e7141f3594f31fd7079","title":"us pga championship 2018 first round live","story":"Phil Mickelson would become the second oldest major winner in history if he lifts the Wanamaker Trophy this week. He’d be a couple of months shy of the record set by 48-year-old Julius Boros, the all-action 1968 PGA champion. He’s currently -1, a couple off Poulter’s early lead, birdies at 11 and 14 sandwiching a dropped shot at 12.Now it’s Rory’s turn to twirl his club in satisfaction after a good job done, as he sends his tee shot at the 190-yard par-three 13th pin high to 12 feet. The putt’s fairly straight, and in it goes. His second birdie of the day, and he moves to -1. Pars for Tiger and JT, meanwhile, the latter saving his with a delicate splash to a couple of feet from the bunker to the left. Meanwhile Ian Poulter has been in sensational form on the PGA Tour of late. Top-ten finishes at the RBC Heritage, the WGC Match Play and last week’s WGC Bridgestone, plus that win at the Houston Open. The 42-year-old from Hitchen now birdies 15, and he hits the lead on his own!You can’t keep a 14-time major winner down! Tiger splits the fairway at 12, then sends a crisp wedge high into the air. The camera loses the flight of the ball, but no matter, because Tiger’s twirled his club you know he likes it. And with good reason, because he lands his second ten feet past the flag, the ball spinning back to kick-in distance. He’ll be back to +2. McIlroy, having hit the longest drive, 338 yards, ends up furthest out after a very average wedge in. He’ll have to make do with par. And finally Thomas, whose second to eight feet would have looked wonderful had it not been hit after Tiger’s sensational wedge. Not that he really cares about that: in goes the putt, and last week’s winner in Akron make it back-to-back birdies. He joins the group of early leaders at -2: JT, Fox, Furyk and Poulter ... but no Cook, who bogeys the par-five 8th after finding water down the right.The leading group at -2 are joined by Ryan Fox, who birdies 8. But Adam Hadwin slips back into the pack at -1 with bogey at 4. Eternal bridesmaid Rickie Fowler picks up his first stroke of the week at 14. Pat Perez, coming off the back of his fine showing at the Open, birdies 11. And a couple of former champions record an early birdie: 2011’s Keegan Bradley at 12, 2008’s Padraig Harrington at 2.Nope, it’s a double bogey for Tiger, whose putt at 11 stubbornly stays high on the right of the cup. He was always a notoriously slow starter in the majors, even in his pomp, dropping shots and losing balls on the opening holes. But he’s already given himself a job of work. He’s +3, and looking extremely put out. Especially as both of his partners make their birdie putts: Rory’s back to level par, while JT looks in the mood to launch a serious defence of his title. He’s -1 and hasn’t looked like putting a foot wrong.The 362-yard par-four 11th is one the players have their beady eyes on. A real birdie chance. JT and Rory set themselves up, the reigning champ wedging his ball to four feet. But it’s disaster for Tiger, who sends his tee shot left into more thick rough, then puts his second into the water guarding the front right of the green. He wedges to 15 feet, but he’ll need to knock that one in to limit the damage to bogey. He’s already a picture of extreme frustration.Adam Hadwin doesn’t have much of a major-championship CV. His best finish is a tie for 24th at this year’s Masters. But the 30-year-old Canadian does share the US Open record for consecutive birdies - six, at Erin Hills in 2017 - and once shot a 59 on Tour. Maybe he’s ready to make his major mark this week? He’s become the first man to reach -2, with birdies at 2 and 3. And he’s since been joined by 2003 US Open champ Jim Furyk (5*), Austin Cook (7) and our very own Ian Poulter, who has started very nicely indeed with birdies at 11 and 12.Rory is left with a lengthy bunker shot. He swings long and easy, and lands his ball a couple of feet from the flag. Only problem is, it bites hard and spins back the best part of 15 feet. His par effort slides by the left of the cup, and that’s an opening bogey. Tiger doesn’t hit his long par saver at all, walking after it, fuming with himself. He does very well to tidy up from six feet to limit the damage to bogey. Meanwhile an easy two-putt par for JT. This isn’t going to be one of those marquee groups in which everyone drags each other down, is it? Please no, we’ve had more than enough of that this year.Tiger’s got a thick lie in rough down the right of the long par-four 10th. His ball’s against the grain, to the extent that he’s forced to take his medicine and lay up. He finds the green with his third, though the ball nearly spins back off the front, leaving a lengthy par putt. Rory meanwhile is into the thick stuff on the right as well, but the grass is facing the right way and he’s able to have a lash at the green. He comes up short, and though he manages to get over the creek, he finds a bunker at the front. JT finds the middle of the dancefloor he’ll be left with a lengthy birdie chance. Here comes the morning marquee group! The defending champion Justin Thomas, who won so convincingly at Quail Hollow last year the 2012 and 2014 PGA champion Rory McIlroy and the 1999, 2000, 2006 and 2007 winner Tiger Woods. These three are the only players to have won both a major championship and a WGC title under the age of 26. All of them belt monster drives down 10 only Thomas manages to find the centre of the fairway, though. Given the generosity of the tracks around Bellerive, that’s a poor return.A big save for Phil Mickelson, opening at 10. He sends his drive way out to the left, and can only lay up. He’s left with a tricky left-to-right breaker from 15 feet to save his par ... and he makes it. A broad smile: the 2005 champ has got away with one there. He bounces off the green, his sunny demeanour matching the weather. It’s beautiful at Bellerive.A disastrous start to one of the pre-tournament favourites Tony Finau. The gentle giant from Utah has finished in the top ten at all three of the majors played so far this season, but completing the set already looks like an uphill task. Bogey at 10, followed by a double at 12, the result of finding a greenside bunker then sending his escape through the back of the green. He’s already +3.Some more players have joined the group leading the way early doors at -1. Alexander Bjork of Sweden has birdied 4 Yuta Ikeda of Japan has picked up a shot on the opening hole and freewheeling entertainer Brandt Snedeker, slowly playing his way back into form after a rib injury took him out last year, birdies 12.In the UK, this tournament is going out on 11 Sports, one of those new-fangled internet concerns they have these days. It’s been a fairly rocky start to their coverage: in lieu of live action, billed to begin at 1.30pm BST, we’ve had shots of Tiger warming up on the range, to the soundtrack of ear-perforating test tone. Then a few minutes of the host broadcaster’s commentary team cleaning their throats, adjusting the height of their chairs, mopping their brows, trying to get a recalcitrant scoring computer to work, and thankfully not saying anything wildly appropriate having assumed they are off-air and a new broadcaster over the pond isn’t erroneously transmitting the feed. Not the most auspicious of beginnings. But then again a false start didn’t do BBC2 any harm in the long run, so they’re in good company.So here we go again, a mere three weeks after the Open, when Francesco Molinari tamed the beast of Carnoustie to win Italy’s first major championship. Going into that week, Ryan Fox was a dark-horse tip, having finished high at the Italian, Irish and Scottish opens. It wasn’t to be - he finished in a tie for 39th place - but the in-form Kiwi has started well as he goes again today. Out in the very first group this morning, he registered the first birdie of the 100th PGA Championship, wedging to seven feet on the opening hole and tidying up. He’s since been joined at -1 by Austin Cook, wasting no time on his PGA Championship debut. The following leader board doesn’t really mean much ... but then again, if you’ve led the PGA Championship, you’ve led the PGA Championship.Welcome to Bellerive Country Club, St Louis, Missouri, where the world’s best golfers line up to take one final pop at Glory’s Last Shot. You see, as of next year, the PGA Championship moves forward in the schedule to May. No longer will this famous old tournament represent the year’s final opportunity to make it into the pantheon. It’s the end of a chapter. It’s also the 100th edition of the Championship. An appropriate time, perhaps, to turn the page.Bellerive has hosted the PGA once before. In 1992, Nick Price saw off Gene Sauers and Nick Faldo to lift the Wanamaker Trophy, the signature moment of his win a 105-foot putt at the 12th on Saturday. The US Open has been held here, too: Gary Player won that in 1965 by beating Kel Nagle in a play-off, the first time the tournament was broadcast in living color. It’s a short roll of honour, then, but one of the highest possible quality. Who’ll be joining the elite company of Player and Price come Sunday evening?Bellerive is a very long course - 7,547 yards - so in theory it’s likely to be one of the big hitters. World number one Dustin Johnson is the favourite defending champion Justin Thomas isn’t far behind him, coming off the back of a win in Akron. The double US Open winner Brooks Koepka has been relentless in the majors of late: his tie for 39th at Carnoustie was the first time he’d failed to finish 13th or better since the 2016 Masters. These guys are hot.But Patrick Reed, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Rickie Fowler, Tommy Fleetwood and Jason Day will be licking their lips in anticipation as well. See also Rory McIlroy he just needs to get that damn putter warmed up. Or how about Tony Finau, who has finished in the top ten of all the majors so far this year? Francesco Molinari, the new Open champion and a runner-up at last year’s PGA, might not be the longest on tour but he is reliably accurate. A lack of distance off the tee might compromise Jordan Spieth’s bid to complete a career slam a lack of accuracy off it might do for the rejuvenated Tiger Woods. On the other hand, there are few competitors more determined, more dogged, more brilliant than those two. So you never know.Hey, maybe someone will burst out of the pack and claim a Championship that’s often won by a relative outsider! Back in the day, few predicted victories for Keegan Bradley, Jason Dufner, YE Yang, Shaun Micheel, Rich Beem or John Daly. But there they are, their names forever engraved on the Wanamaker Trophy. Another fairytale would do just fine. Speaking of which, how about Lefty becoming the second-oldest major winner of all time, a couple of months shy of Julius Boros, who won this thing in 1968 aged 48 years, four months and 18 days? The possibilities are endless. It’s all too much.So here we are, with four days of major championship fun stretching out ahead of us. Excited? Oh yes. On tenterhooks? You betcha. Overcome by golf fever? Us too. Somebody, please, call Dr Golf!Here are the tee times. All players are from the US unless stated, and the times are local.

I would like a PC that he can use for his school work. He is starting his GCSEs this year. I don’t want to spend more than £1,000. Could you recommend something which will do both jobs? BMLPC manufacturers love the gaming market, which is growing strongly and worth more than $30bn a year. Most PCs outperform their users, and the processor goes to sleep between keystrokes. Gamers, by contrast, never have enough power, and will pay more for better performance. This translates into higher prices and better profit margins. They also like cases that look like props from science-fiction movies.You will also need to buy a monitor, but your son will be able to use it with his games PC and his Xbox, liberating the family TV set. He will also be able to use it for schoolwork, and for many other purposes including VR and movie editing.There are lots of good gaming laptops, led by the Asus ROG (Republic of Gamers) range and MSI (Micro-Star International), with Gigabyte among the interesting challengers. The main drawbacks are that gaming laptops are expensive and most of them are not really portable.Desktops have several advantages over laptops. First, you get more power for less money, partly because they can run hotter, faster processors. Second, they are easier to upgrade. If you don’t have the budget for a top-of-the-range PC, you can add more memory and – most importantly – a faster graphics card later. Third, as I never tire of repeating, desktops have better ergonomics and are better for your health.Fortunately, all the largest Windows PC manufacturers now offer off-the shelf gaming PCs at reasonable prices. HP and Dell got into the market early by taking over specialist suppliers. Dell bought Alienware in March 2006. HP responded by buying Voodoo in September 2006. Lenovo belatedly entered the market in 2015 with its Y Series laptops and desktops, adding Razer Editions to get the attention of serious gamers.HP, Dell and Lenovo are now the world’s three largest PC suppliers. They have huge buying power, economies of scale, and wide distribution. You can probably find at least one of their systems locally at John Lewis, Currys PC World or Argos. In fact, Argos offers 106 gaming PCs – half of them desktops – which illustrates the strength of the marketThere’s not a lot to choose between them, as you’ll get much the same parts. Your son may have a preference, based on appearance or street cred, while you should look at service and support options.Until recently, the quad-core Intel Core i7-7700 was the processor of choice for gaming, with the Core i5-7400 as the less powerful but cheaper option. They have now been replaced by two six-core chips, the i7-8700 and the i5-8400. Any of these four should be fine.The minimum memory requirement is 8GB, and it’s generally enough. However, 16GB is popular and 32GB is usually an option.Serious graphics cards start with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050Ti, which has its own 3GB or 4GB of fast memory. After that you can climb through the 1060, 1070 and 1080 models with 6GB or 8GB of memory, before getting into dual graphics cards that cost more than most PCs. AMD’s Radeon RX 570 and RX 580 are also good upgrades, but not as common.When it comes to storage, my recommended minimum is a 128GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD for the boot disk plus a 1TB traditional hard drive for storage. Serious gamers usually want bigger SSDs, from 256GB to 1TB.One money-saving alternative is a Seagate FireCuda (PDF), which packages some Flash memory with a traditional hard drive. Another is adding 16GB of Intel Optane memory. Both are better than having a solitary hard drive.If there’s a choice of power supply, 400W-500W is good, with 850W and similar options for high-end and dual graphics cards.If you shop around, get as close to this spec as you can …Remember, you can play games on almost any PC. When you buy a games machine, you’re paying extra for things like high-resolution graphics, shadows and lighting effects, a high frame-rate, and fast response times. You can tune different games to your PC’s performance or use quick settings such as low, medium, high and ultra. Higher settings provide more realistic images but lower frame-rates. There’s an excellent YouTube video that uses Deus Ex: Mankind Divided to illustrate the differences.It’s probably a good sign of a competitive market that I couldn’t find any real bargains, even at Argos. Lower prices generally turned out to involve compromises such as shipping a slower SSD or none at all, fitting a FireCuda drive, or reducing the graphics card’s memory and so on.I spent my own money on an i5-8400 when it came out last year, and I still can’t see a better alternative for gaming at less than £1,000.Have you got a question?

There are too many flavours to count: my three-year-old was bowled over by the simple vanilla, my husband by the local caramel fleur-de-sel (sea salt, for which the island is famous) and I couldn’t get enough of the Ferrero Rocher and the peppered raspberry. Eat in La Martinière’s garden reclining on the deckchairs, or stroll down to the lighthouse gardens and enjoy the view over the Atlantic as the waves crash onto the beach below. • 17 quai de La Poithevinière9 Allee du Phare, la-martiniere.frJo DevineThe best ice-cream parlour in Paris is Martine Lambert, a few minutes away from the Eiffel tower. In a delightful untouristy pedestrian street, it offers incredibly tasty artisan and natural ice-creams and sorbets, competing on flavour and price with the more famous Bertillon. You instantly feel like you are eating a fruit (the seasonal fruit varieties are incredible, such as vine peach). The chocolate sorbet is the best I have tasted in Europe you will not want to eat any other chocolate ice-cream any more. For the beachside version, head to Deauville, the chic Normandy town.• 39 Rue Cler, Paris76B rue Eugene Colas, Deauville, martine-lambertlydieTongue-tingling gelato, made from natural ingredients – milk, eggs and soy – with names such as Caffe Altura, Luz Supremo, Lime Basil and Organic Late Harvest Mandarin. The range of cups and cones includes a wide choice of toppings and even macaroons. But the treat and surprise is that they use a flat paddle-like spoon cutting a slice of whatever flavour combination you choose to create perfect petals of gelato sculpted to form a delicate rose in your cone. Almost too good to eat! Prices start at around €3.• 15 Place du Marché, amorinoLydnaItaly is the undisputed capital of ice-cream but I’d argue its twin cradles are far from the capital: in Bologna, where the gelato is eggy and rich, and in Sicily, where flavours tend to be lighter and sweeter. That said, my favourite address will always be Gelateria Duse in Parioli, an elegant residential district of Rome. When your Roman friend or colleague claims never to have heard of it, it’s because he or she has probably only ever known it as Giovanni’s. Well into his 80s, Giovanni remains a pillar of the community, and those he sold cones to as children now come to see him with their own. Giovanni uses fruits fresh from the market and his scoops are big, while his prices are small (€2 for a single cone). Nowhere will you find as pure an expression of what ice-cream means to the Italians: basic rite, real pleasure and the importance of a shared tradition. • 1B Via Eleonora Duse, no websiteEdThe best artisanal ice-cream in Venice: the fig and mascarpone is amazing. Cheap prices (scoops from €1.50) perhaps because it is close to the university (a 20-minute walk from Rialto Bridge), and usually has a queue because of this. Has a mix of traditional and unusual interesting flavours – cream of the doge (candied orange and chocolate) and all the Italian classics, stracciatella, amarena etc – buonissimo!• 3058 Dorsoduro, a campo S Margherita, gelateriaildogeAlexis EastonEven Neapolitans travel for miles in pilgrimage to family-run Chalet Ciro in the beautiful little port of Mergellina in Naples. The ice-cream will ruin all future ice-creams rich, dense and fresh. Try the fior di latte – the most pure of gelato flavours – for a sophisticated version of that old-school childhood taste for milk and cream. Also a great place for coffee and cakes.• Via Caracciolo, Mergellina, Naples, chaletciro.itRussell SimpsonA pitstop at Bella Blu Gelateria is the perfect way to cool down from an afternoon on the beach in Polignano a Mare in Puglia. The dreamy pastel decor of the parlour mirrors the colourful selection of gelato flavours on offer. After much deliberation, I opted for a “cono” with a scoop of pistachio. It was delicious. So much so, that I returned the next day for an equally scrumptious scoop of hazelnut. • Via Martiri Di Dogali, on FacebookDanielleA short walk from the Berlin Wall Memorial park, Süßfein makes ice-cream and sorbet in fresh-tasting flavours such as apricot and goat’s cheese, pistachio with nougat and marzipan, Indian mango, raspberry, and Moscow mule. At €1.40 for one scoop it is slightly more than the average in Germany but the flavours are bright and true. The menu changes regularly – and the delicious cakes are not to be overlooked, either. Tables are few but there are parks nearby where you can enjoy your treats.• Brunnenstraße 156, suessfein-berlin.deShelleyThe flavours are truly a display of craft and inventiveness rose and hibiscus, chocolate and ginger, olive and lemon are all a creamy revelation. The location is beautiful it’s right by several museums – Museum Brandhorst, for art, and the wonderful Reich der Kristalle for crystal displays – and you can just about stroll to the Englischer Garten before your ice-cream starts to melt. Excellent value at €1.60 for a scoop, and you get a spoonful of another flavour to try.• 46 Theresienstraße, ballabeni.detiagoBrymor’s ice-cream is made using the milk from Guernsey cows grazed on the lush grass around the farm close to the ruins of Jervaux Abbey between Middleham and the brewery town of Masham in the Yorkshire dales. Rich, creamy concoctions such as liquorice and blackcurrant, banana and mango or the famous thunder and lightning, or all three, can be enjoyed on site after watching the cows being milked, taking a stroll to enjoy the magnificent Wensleydale scenery, browsing the farm shop and letting the kids run free in one of the play areas. • High Jervaulx Farm, Masham, brymordairyDianeCraig’s makes its own ice-cream, from milk produced by cows on its farm. You can watch them grazing in the fields as you sit on a wooden bench outside the little farm shop. All the regular flavours are available, such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and rum and raisin. Things are kept traditional with apple crumble flavour ice-cream but it also has something a bit more adventurous in Turkish delight,melon and ginger, and lemon cheesecake flavours.Cones from £2.25 portion sizes are generous, so you will not be disappointed. • Craiglea House, Weymouth, craigsfarmdairyCaseyThe freshest, healthiest gelato … and a delightful assault on the senses, as well as inexpensive and served by friendly staff. Green \u0026amp Jenks is in a historic, Georgian building on Monnow Street, in the town centre. A place of sweetness and laughter that my children’s memories will hopefully always return to. • Gelato from £2.20, 11 Agincourt Square, Monnow Street, greenandjenksSarah WoodallFor me, the only place to buy ice-cream is Nicholls of Parkgate. The Nicholls family have been making delicious homemade ice-cream for 75 years. You can buy a cornet at £1.60, or fancy cones and tubs – and even buy a 1 litre box of your favourites to take home. There are more than 10 regular flavours, including banana choc chip, cinder toffee and lemon and line.• The Parade, Parkgate, Neston, nichollsicecream Catherine RenfreyThere are fantastic regular flavours here but new ones are always being experimented with. It also does a great range of sugar-free ones and ices to suit most dietary needs. You can take out or eat in, though it’s always busy. It is our “go to place” when we arrive in Malta. • 44 Spring Street, Bugibba, St. Paul’s Bay, sottozerofactoryPatriciaThis place serves award-winning gelato. Creamy, luscious and with distinctive flavours I’ve never seen anywhere else. Try the Frollini, an Italian chocolate with hazelnut cookies. The ice-cream is made fresh every day using organic milk and includes the Capriccio, which is a panna cotta with homemade caramel sauce and caramelised peanuts. Don’t let the queue deter you. It moves fast. • Poortstraat 93, lekkerijs.nlJakobFamily-owned, this typical Spanish ice-cream parlour and turron boutique has a great old-school interior. I thought it was amazingly cheap considering the quality and flavour (around €1.50 a scoop) on offer – and the servings are generous, too. Try orange with chocolate chips or leche merengada (a Spanish classic based on a chilled “whipped milk” and cinnamon drink). Enjoy your ice-cream while strolling around the cathedral area andor the Paseo del Parque boulevard. • Calle Marqués de Larios 5, no website ChrisThis parlour is tucked away in Østerbro but still has queues out of the door. The selection of organic gelato changes daily but extraordinary regulars include hazelnut and bergamot, coffee and lemongrass, lemon and poppy seed and coconut with hibiscus. Would recommend getting at least two scoops of the cinnamon with caramel (about £4) and snapping a photo of the stylish little shop – even the method of displaying the flavours on offer is a typically cool Danish design.• Isoteket, 43 Randersgade, on FacebookRachelOn a quiet alley on the less-touristy side of the River Oder, Lody Roma was opened in 1946 by two soldiers: an Italian and a Pole. It’s still going strong and serving up creamy, characterful flavours. Black sesame (czarny sezam) is a must and look out for seasonal specials such as pumpkin (dynia). It’s a stone’s throw from the river, so you can stroll the waterfront as you eat. • From 84p a scoop, Ludwika Rydygiera 5, 50-248, lodyroma.plRichard GreenhillIn a corner of St Stephen’s Basilica square, this parlour, founded by head chef Niki Szökrön, a former fashion model who trained in ice-cream making in Bologna, serves ice-cream beautifully scooped out into petals to form a flower in the colours (or rather tastes) of your choice. Delicious and inventive flavours (strawberry and elderflower, pear and chocolate, sorrel) and it’s really cheap, too: £1.40 for two flavours £1.90 for four. It even had a rainbow-coloured special for Pride recently – top marks!• Szent István tér 3, St Istvan Basilica, gelartorosaEllieThere used to be a network of garages under this shop, which the owner converted into an ice-cream factory in the 1970s after arriving from Angola. Artisanal, great ingredients and a family business. Try the seaweed flavour. It’s magnificent.

What would it be like if more people literally felt at home with the name of a strong woman?”The first 12 women who were honoured by the group during a renaming session in Amsterdam include Ada Lovelace, the British mathematician who designed the first algorithm, Marie Anne Tellegen, a Dutch resistance fighter and Beyoncé, described by the group as “one of the most famous icons of our time” who has “made feminism and the position of Afro-Americans an explicit subject of her work”.Rokin, a central thoroughfare in Amsterdam, has had a sign installed bearing the name Beyoncé Boulevard.The initiative has now moved on to Rotterdam, Groningen, Utrecht and elsewhere, with the aim of renaming thousands of streets.The group is placing the new street signs under the existing ones, to emphasise that the purpose is not forcing men to give way. The stated aim is to make people think and encourage the municipality to consider female alternatives when naming new housing estates.Santi van den Toorn, one of the movement’s founders, told the Het Parool newspaper: “It is always said that it is logical that there are so many male street names because history is written by men but there were also important women.“The street names are of course only part of a bigger problem, but everyone lives in a street, so everyone understands this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa843226bdcbc6151118c1a7b714fe248c7f7146/0_31_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0b477fc10afeff51546fcdbcec86d60","title":"hurricane maria puerto rico six stories","story":"A university student, a mother with two sons in prison and a food truck owner explain how their lives were uprooted following the storm“When the hurricane came I had just started back at university,” said Camille Mercado Rivera, a 19-year-old science major at the University of Puerto Rico. “We had two days of classes and then we were out.”Her family had prepared for the gas lines by fueling their car before the storm, but because electricity was out for longer than anticipated, they had to buy a generator. She said her close-knit community in Caguas watched out for each other, and threaded power cables between homes so neighbors could have access to electricity.One of her school buildings had been ripped apart, but she was able to return to class earlier than expected.“Out of the blue, it was like, we’re starting, the 30th of November,” Mercado Rivera said.For the first week of class, students wrote in the dark because there was still no electricity.She has also spent the months since Maria volunteering with her father in a San Juan kitchen operated by the not-for-profit World Central Kitchen, which has provided 3.6m meals to Puerto Ricans since the hurricane hit.“People keep asking me: ‘Why are you still cooking? You are a science major,’” Mercado Rivera said. “But I’m volunteering and helping people. I want to be a pharmacist because I want to help people.”She said the core volunteers and workers at World Central Kitchen, who number about 100, had grown very close since the hurricane. “It’s not like coming to work, it’s like coming to see my family,” she said.“It was one month without hearing from my two sons. They are both incarcerated at the Bayamón prison and I couldn’t speak to them or visit them that whole time. The communication with prison staff was so bad. My sadness and anxiety was overwhelming. I had no idea if they were eating or even if they were still alive.“I live in the suburbs of San Juan and my home was torn apart. The windows were broken in by Maria and the house flooded. My clothes were destroyed. My stove and my refrigerator washed away.“When I finally got in contact with my two boys, Juan Carlos, who is serving a 50-year homicide sentence, and Freddie, who is serving 28 years for attempted homicide, I had to bring them food and bottled water. They said the food inside was still basic rations, and told me the medical care was terrible.“They said they were terrified during Maria. It felt like the prison was collapsing and they had no idea what was going on.“I try to see them at least once a week. I’m terrified about what will happen if another hurricane hits.”Before the hurricane, Griselle Vila was a celebrated private chef in San Juan, working from home in a cooking business her mother has owned for nearly three decades.Nine months later, most of her time is spent in one of the many kitchens operated by World Central Kitchen, where she works as executive chef.Vila heard about the group’s efforts to cook thousands of meals to deliver to hard-hit areas and volunteered to help. “It became an addiction,” Vila said.Vila lives in San Juan and during the hurricane watched as water poured through a skylight into her mother’s closet. During breaks in the storm, Vila, like her neighbors, would climb on to the roof and clean out the gutters, hoping to reduce the water flowing into her home.Her home was in relatively good condition after the storm, but she said the hurricane was “the most terrifying thing I ever lived through”.“Most people have been through an earthquake at some point. Imagine an 18-hour earthquake,” Vila said. “Everything was trembling. It was insane.”She works long hours, sometimes more than 20 hours a day, and occasionally loses sleep thinking of the work ahead. But she perseveres because she knows her island is in need.“Whenever I’m getting tired and losing strength to do this, I go out on deliveries with Lola – she’s one of our volunteers – and I go to her community and see what’s going on,” said Vila. “It keeps you going. There’s no way to stop once you see what’s going on.”At the Miramar food truck park in San Juan, Javier Seáñez slings steaming carne asada and chile relleno tacos from his Las Cucharas food truck, which he has run for three years.The 35-year-old said in the weeks after the hurricane, work was almost impossible across the food industry because grocery stores were understocked and rationing what supplies they had left.“Right now, I can go to the grocery store and get 100 pounds of pork, but then I couldn’t because it was supposed to be equal for everyone,” Seáñez said.There were also enormous lines at the grocery store, gasoline stations and ATMs to deal with.“I had to wait in lines at the grocery store every day, for two, three hours before they opened, to cook fresh.” Seáñez said.Seáñez, who moved from Juárez, Mexico, to Puerto Rico three years ago, said Maria changed how he looked at life on the island, but he refused to live in fear of the next hurricane.“We are ready, or at least a little bit more prepared, for another situation like that,” Seáñez said. “And we are thinking in advance what could happen again.”He said the scale of destruction had had a huge impact on how he related to his neighbors.“You become more human because you see people’s needs,” Seáñez said. “Because no one, no one knows what really happened unless you were here. Because what the media shows and the press shows, it doesn’t even compare to the situation we were in.”“My home is at the bottom of a hill here in Arecibo. When the hurricane came there was a big wave and we had to be rescued from the home it was destroyed.“We were taken to a hospital and it collapsed while we were still there. There was a hole in the roof and the water was coming in. They would write our social security numbers on our arms with a Sharpie because we had to be taken out so quickly. My son was one of the people taking others out, including babies.“I had diabetes and now I’m a cancer patient. I had a relapse because of what happened I didn’t have the medicine I need. I still have trouble getting the medication.“At the beginning, I used to think a lot about the hurricanes and have nightmares. I used to cry a lot. But my son helped calm me down.“Now I’m in a place paid for by Fema. I’m now trying to get back on my feet and stabilize my health.”“The hurricane took apart my house, took off the walls, the roof, the ceiling, everything. I wasn’t there at the time I was at my daughter’s house because it was fully equipped for a hurricane.“I had to move in with my daughter and my son-in-law. I’ve been here for nine months now. It’s been very difficult because the house is very small compared to mine. I feel uncomfortable because there’s no privacy and I feel like I’m going crazy. It’s OK for the first few days but then time just goes on.“I’ve applied for a new place because I can’t see myself going back to my destroyed house. I want to get back on my feet because my life is very frustrating at the moment.“I used to work in a body shop, painting cars. But I’m not working now because I had a hernia, had a couple of surgeries. I’m trying to get my pension. I might just have to get a part-time job.“I have a macaw called Galito. He keeps me company.

Actually it’s my wife who got me here. Her sister sends a lot of Ikea stuff from Dubai. So here we are,” said Nasrullah Khan, 34, an IT manager.Patrik Antoni, the deputy retail manager for Ikea India, said he had tears in his eyes when the first customers arrived. “It is overwhelming, a dream come true,” he said.The differences compared with Ikea products offered elsewhere start with the food in the restaurant – “Smaklig måltid”, “enjoy your meal” in Swedish, is written on the wall – which has space for 1,000 people, the company’s biggest to date. For religious reasons, the meatballs are not beef or pork but chicken or vegetarian. A biryani dish was on offer for 99 rupees (£1.12).Alongside standard Ikea furniture such as Billy bookshelves and Klippan loveseats, the chain has “locally relevant products” such as masala boxes, Indian frying pans called tawas, rice cake makers and mattresses with coconut-fibre centres.There are also more than 1,000 products priced at under 200 rupees to satisfy consumers whom John Achillea, the store manager, said had “big aspirations for their homes and small wallets”. A six-piece bowl set with cutlery for children costs 131 rupees, for example.The interior has an Indian feel, too, with patterned bedspreads and framed photos of the Taj Mahal and other Indian monuments – alongside Gustav Klimt’s painting The Kiss, recalling faraway Europe.“We decided not to copy and paste,” said Juvencio Maeztu, Ikea’s chief financial officer. “We met and interacted with 1,000 Indian families to understand what were their dreams, their frustrations and what they want.”To overcome Indians’ aversion to assembling furniture, with people used to small, family-owned businesses providing a bespoke service, Ikea teamed up with UrbanClap, an online platform that connects people looking for work with consumers.Satish Meena of Forrester Research said Ikea would also have to further adapt its offerings to the “extremely erse” Indian market as the company expands.“No two states or cities have the same furniture demand and behaviour lifestyle and culture vary from one region to another. Hence, Ikea will have to address space, pricing and design issues and pick products accordingly,” Meena said.In Hyderabad, some residents were sceptical about the opening.“I will wait and watch,” said Mohammad Noor, a businessman. “I have never been to an Ikea store before. But I believe there it’s all compressed wood. Indian wood is much better.”Siddharth, in charge of a Hyderabad furniture shop, said Ikea may attract hard-up students but in general people would stick with “quality”.“It will be a flop, I tell you,” he said. “The regular furniture consumer will stick with the more solid wood available in the Indian market ... I don’t think it will give us much competition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12831f695d6300112505d9e8b103f19c47a9dab4/0_118_4296_2577/master/4296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2bc95b1b289841f80634afb2ddaad1f","title":"russia blasts new us sanctions as theatre of the absurd","story":"Officials vow countermeasures and markets slump after tough measures unveiled over Salisbury attackRussian officials reacted with outrage and markets slumped on Thursday morning following the announcement of tough new US sanctions over Russia’s alleged use of a nerve agent in the Salisbury attack.President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the sanctions were “absolutely unlawful and don’t conform to international law”, as politicians vowed to respond with countermeasures, which could include bans on the exports of rockets or resources for manufacturing.“The theatre of the absurd continues,” tweeted Dmitry Polyanskiy, first deputy permanent representative of Russia to the UN. “No proofs, no clues, no logic, no presumption of innocence, just highly-likelies. Only one rule: blame everything on Russia, no matter how absurd and fake it is. Let us welcome the United Sanctions of America!”One senior Russian MP called the US a “police state”.A member of the Duma’s foreign affairs committee, Leonid Slutsky, said Russia could block exports of RD-180 rocket engines to the US as a potential countermeasure, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.The United States announced on Wednesday that it would impose restrictions on the export of sensitive technology to Russia because of its use of a nerve agent in the attempted murder of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain.The State Department said the new sanctions would come into effect on 22 August and would be followed by much more sweeping measures, such as suspending diplomatic relations and revoking Aeroflot landing rights, if Russia did not take “remedial” action within 90 days.Moscow is not expected to agree to the response required by US legislation, which includes opening up Russian scientific and security facilities to international inspections to assess whether it is producing chemical and biological weapons in violation of international law.“Certainly it is really up to Russia to make that decision, whether they meet this criteria,” a senior administration official said. “The second round of sanctions … are in general more draconian than the first round.”Another senior state department official said the US received in March “persuasive information” from the UK that Russia was behind the attack. It made its own determination last weekend and was now acting on the basis of “objective facts” and “legal requirements”.The US has already expelled 60 suspected Russian spies as part of a global response to the March attack in Salisbury against Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence, and his daughter, Yulia, in which a rare and potent Russian-made nerve agent, novichok, was found to have been used.The Kremlin has vehemently denied British accusations that it orchestrated the attacks. Since the March attack, two other residents from the Salisbury area have been poisoned by exposure to novichok.Dawn Sturgess died in July after handling a small bottle contaminated with the nerve agent on 30 June. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, was also taken ill after being exposed to the nerve agent.The new sanctions involve the export of a long list of equipment deemed to be sensitive on national security grounds, including gas turbine engines, integrated circuits, and calibration equipment used in avionics. A US official said that about half of US exports to Russia contained sensitive components. At the moment, such exports are considered on a case-by-case basis. After 22 August, there will be a “presumption of denial”, meaning that the default position will be for such exports to be banned.The official said the value of the affected exports could run to “hundreds of millions of dollars”.The administration has signalled, however, that it intends to grant exemptions for foreign assistance, cooperation on space projects and aviation safety.The senior official would not say if new intelligence had triggered the sanctions, but they come at a time when UK authorities appear to be making progress in the investigation. As the  revealed this week, the British government is poised to submit an extradition request to Moscow for two Russians suspected of carrying out the Salisbury attack.A British government spokesman welcomed Washington’s announcement, saying: “The strong international response to the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury sends an unequivocal message to Russia that its provocative, reckless behaviour will not go unchallenged.”The sanctions are the latest in a series of tough measures approved against Russia that seem at odds with Trump’s own reluctance to criticise Putin publicly.During a jarring public appearance in Helsinki last month, Trump appeared to disregard his own senior intelligence chief’s testimony that Russia had tried to interfere in the 2016 US presidential elections, and the Salisbury chemical attack was barely addressed at all. But while Trump has acted deferentially toward the Russian leader in public, the harsh measures in the sanctions bill are largely regulated by a US law on the use of chemical weapons, and leave the Trump administration little room to manoeuvre.Additional reporting by Luke Harding"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff85178607505bc1664009d967dd48dcae74075/397_693_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c713fcd3ea2d1f052d5a2901c8d340","title":"buddhist monks in the himalayas get ready for winter in pictures","story":"About 5,500m (18,000ft) above sea level in the Indian Himalayas sits the Tangyud Gompa Buddhist monastery, where snow can leave the monks in complete isolation for seven months a year.

Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3590951.1533822814!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nasa hopes scorching journey explains how sun defies all logic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA   Nasa image shows an artist’s rendering of the Parker Solar Probe approaching the sun.

Photograph: Steve GribbenJohns Hopkins APLNASA via AP.Nasa is set to send a spacecraft on a scorching journey towards the sun, with an aim to offer the closest-ever glimpse of the star at the centre of the solar system.The Parker Solar Probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker, will, as the US space agency describes it, “touch the sun” as it flies within 3.9 million miles of the star’s surface.The car-sized probe, which will fly closer to the sun than any other man-made object, is set to blast off on Saturday at 3.33am (8.33am Irish time) from Cape Canaveral, Florida.Its mission is to help scientists unlock the mysteries of the sun’s atmosphere and answer questions like why its corona, the outermost layer of the solar atmosphere, is hotter than its surface.The probe will travel at more than 690,000kmh, faster than any spacecraft in history, and use Venus’s gravity over the course of seven years to gradually bring its orbit closer to the sun.The spacecraft is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in 2024, as it flies 3.9 million miles above the solar surface.The last time a man-made object came close to the star’s surface was in 1976 when Helios 2 achieved perihelion, the point of the orbit at which it was closest to the sun, at 27 million miles.Over the course of its mission, the Parker Solar Probe will orbit the sun 24 times while being subjected to extreme heat and radiation, with temperatures expected to reach 1,377 degrees, nearly hot enough to melt steel.On each close approach to the sun, the probe will sample the solar wind, study the sun’s corona, and provide close-up observations.Scientists hope the mission will be able to provide answers as to why the corona is 300 times hotter than the surface of the sun, a phenomenon that Nasa says is in “defiance of all logic” because “its atmosphere gets much, much hotter the farther it stretches from the sun’s blazing surface”.The spacecraft will make use of an 8ft-long heat shield known as the Thermal Protection System (TPS), which has been made using a carbon composite coated with ceramic to cope with the extreme conditions and temperature fluctuations.Nasa says the TPS has been tested to withstand temperatures of up to 1,650 degrees and “can handle any heat the sun can send its way”.Poking out over the heat shield, an instrument known as the Faraday cup will take measurements of the solar winds, a flow of ionised gases from the sun that streams past Earth at a million miles per hour.Understanding more about solar activity could help scientists forecast the large eruptions from the sun that pose a threat to satellite and communications systems. - PA"},{"url":null,"title":"nasas daring mission touch sun explained","story":"Nasa is preparing to embark on a daring mission to touch the sun on Saturday,  aiming to go closer than any other spacecraft has ventured.The Parker Solar Probe will endure wicked heat while zooming through the solar corona to study this outermost part of the stellar atmosphere that gives rise to the solar wind.The launch is currently targeted for August 11 at 3:33 a.m. EDT (8.33am BST), with an extended launch window through to August 23.To send a probe where you haven\u0027t been before is ambitious. To send it into such brutal conditions is highly ambitious, Nicola Fox, a project scientist from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said.The project, with a $1.5 billion price tag, is the first major mission under Nasa\u0027s Living With a Star programme.Nasa is hoping to use the data collected from the probe to help astronomers predict solar storms and explain some of the deepest mysteries surrounding our source of light and heat.The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, is set to use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to steadily reduce its orbit around the Sun, using instruments designed to image the solar wind and study electric and magnetic fields, coronal plasma and energetic particles.Nasa aims to collect data about the inner workings of the highly magnetized corona.Although 4 million miles sounds like a long way by our tiny standards here on Earth, being that close to the sun is likely to be a risk for the spacecraft.For example, by orbiting the sun at a distance of between 28 and 43 million miles, Mercury\u0027s surface and atmosphere have been completely changed by the constant stream of radiation and particles from the sun.It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 29 degrees Celsius even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 1,370 degrees Celsius at its closest pass.The closest a spacecraft has been before is when Helios 2 came within 27 million miles of the sun in 1976. By way of comparison, the average distance from the Sun for Earth is 93 million miles.Technicians and engineers perform light bar testing on NASA\u0026#39s Parker Solar Probe at the Astrotech processing facility in TitusvilleThe information collected from the probe is likely to help future generations of humans, who may one day live outside the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.Our world has since grown ever more dependent on a network of technology – both in orbit and on our planet\u0027s surface – that\u0027s vulnerable to a threat we barely understand.These people will need the knowledge to protect themselves from severe winds of charged particles and radiation.The resulting data will improve forecasts of major space-weather events that impact life on Earth, as well as satellites and astronauts in space.Alex Young, a solar scientist at NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, said it was of fundamental importance for us to be able to predict this space weather, much like we predict weather here on Earth.In the most extreme cases of these space weather events, it can actually affect our power grids here on Earth, he added.Please review our commenting policyRussia threatens to ban sale of space rocket engine to US over sanctionsPregnant Chinese woman, 67, vows to continue with pregnancy despite opposition from doctorsTourists could be made to file past Rome\u0026#39s Trevi Fountain on one-way route in bid to control overcrowdingHow Pakistan plans to boost human health by bringing vultures back from the brink of extinctionGoodbye, Grimmy: the rise and fall of the BBC\u0026#39s most fashionable DJLate-summer break to Argentina?

There isn\u0027t a person in the state that isn\u0027t hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities, Blair said in a statement.Cattle on a dry paddock in the drought-hit area of Quirindi in New South WalesFarm reservoirs have dried up and crops are failing.State and federal governments are providing financial help, but not enough for many farmers.With dry conditions forecast to continue for the next three months, farmers had to decide whether to continue the expensive and laborious task of hand-feeding cattle and sheep or sell their livestock.The state government on Wednesday also lifted the number of kangaroos that farmers are allowed to shoot and reduced bureaucratic red tape facing land holders applying for permission to shoot.Farmer Clive Barton walking through the paddocks in the drought-hit area of Duri in New South WalesThe requirement to tag dead kangaroos to keep a tally of the number shot across the state had been dispensed with.Many farmers are taking livestock off their paddocks, only to then see kangaroos move in and take whatever is left, Blair said.If we don\u0027t manage this situation, we will start to see tens of thousands of kangaroos starving and suffering, ultimately leading to a major animal welfare crisis, he added.A train makes its way through dry paddocks in the drought-hit area of Quirindi in New South WalesBut Ray Borda, president of the Kangaroo Industries Association of Australia, which represents commercial shooters who hunt kangaroos for meat and leather, raised animal welfare concerns about the regulation changes.Anybody on the land that will make a phone call to the Department of Environment can get permission to shoot almost whatever they want to shoot and it\u0027s unaudited and unchecked and that\u0027s our concern - animal welfare, Borda told Australian Broadcasting Corp.The government would have been better off subsidizing professional shooters to reduce kangaroo numbers more humanely, he said.We see this as probably the worst possible outcome for the kangaroo, but I\u0027ve got to emphasize we do understand the plight that farmers are in, Borda said. Please review our commenting policyPregnant Chinese woman, 67, vows to continue with pregnancy despite opposition from doctorsTourists could be made to file past Rome\u0026#39s Trevi Fountain on one-way route in bid to control overcrowdingHow Pakistan plans to boost human health by bringing vultures back from the brink of extinctionGoodbye, Grimmy: the rise and fall of the BBC\u0026#39s most fashionable DJLate-summer break to Argentina?

We wrote to the provincial health secretary asking him to restrict these two drugs from the area. I think it\u0027s good news for vultures.”The Chief Drug Inspector of Sindh has ordered regional and district drug inspectors to restrict the use of aceclofenac and ketoprofen..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Without vultures, the numbers of mammalian scavengers increases, which increases the potential for disease transmissionPakistan Vulture Restoration ProjectThe Pakistan Vulture Restoration Project (PVRP) led by Mr Iqba l has spent the past 12 years campaigning for the banning of the toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which cause kidney failure in the birds.A statement from the PVRP, which includes the UK\u0027s Hawk Conservancy Trust and the WWF, said vultures\u0027 collapse had “serious consequences for people”.Their waste removal service controls the populations of disease-carrying scavengers that are a threat to human health.“By suppressing the numbers of mammalian scavengers at carcasses, the potential for disease transmission is reduced. Without vultures, the numbers of mammalian scavengers increases, which increases the potential for disease transmission, threatening the health of humans and wildlife.”Vultures\u0027 removal of carrion leaves less food for other scavengers, such as dogs. A collapse in vulture numbers in India has been blamed for a huge rise in the feral dog population at the same time and a rise in rabies cases. Vultures strong digestive juices also allow them to eat diseased carrion, cleaning up carcasses that may be infected with deadly microbes.Where will the next pandemic come from? | The candidatesThe most common NSAID, diclofenac, was banned from veterinary use in Pakistan, India and Nepal in 2006. But vets have continued to use residual stockpiles and the similar drugs aceclofenac and ketoprofen have continued to pose a threat to the Gyps group of vultures, including white-backed vultures and long-billed vultures. Tens of millions are thought to have died in the past two decades across South Asia alone, cutting populations by somewhere between 95 and 99 per cent.Mr Iqbal said conservationists will conduct spot checks at vets to see if the restrictions have really cut back on the availability of the drugs, or whether they are still available on the black market.He has been carrying out research on vultures for more than 20 years. He said: “The populations are still declining. If this decline continues, we are afraid that these species will become extinct.”To try to stem the birds\u0027 decline, the PVRP has set up a breeding centre in Punjab province and a “vulture safe zone” in Sindh where some of the last colonies of white-backed and long-billed vultures can be found.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Russia threatens to ban sale of space rocket engine to US over sanctionsPregnant Chinese woman, 67, vows to continue with pregnancy despite opposition from doctorsTourists could be made to file past Rome\u0026#39s Trevi Fountain on one-way route in bid to control overcrowdingGoodbye, Grimmy: the rise and fall of the BBC\u0026#39s most fashionable DJLate-summer break to Argentina?

NGOs say Spain\u0027s asylum system is completely collapsed - a claim the central government has denied - while local governments have been emitting increasingly desperate calls for assistance.Some migrants disembark after the arrival of the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms\u0026#39 ship in the southern Spanish port of AlgecirasMr Landaluce said Algeciras did not have the money to cope with an Aquarius every day, noting the area\u0027s high levels of unemployment and the needs of those arriving. I don\u0027t want a social imbalance to be created, here we live in peace and harmony and there are no tensions, he said.The mayor demanded to know Madrid\u0027s plans for dealing with the crisis, and that the government press harder in Europe for a common migration policy. On Tuesday, Spain\u0027s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, accused Mr Salvini of playing politics at the cost of not only Spain but the whole of Europe.Mr Salvini hit back, claiming Spain favoured out of control immigration. Please review our commenting policyPregnant Chinese woman, 67, vows to continue with pregnancy despite opposition from doctorsTourists could be made to file past Rome\u0026#39s Trevi Fountain on one-way route in bid to control overcrowdingHow Pakistan plans to boost human health by bringing vultures back from the brink of extinctionGoodbye, Grimmy: the rise and fall of the BBC\u0026#39s most fashionable DJLate-summer break to Argentina?

Now that we know, I think we’re obligated to ask those next sets of questions and really understand it.”In recent years, studies have shown that even an increase of a few hundred parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air we breath causes people to test lower for cognitive skills.

The average was 603 parts per million, just slightly higher than levels found in the air.Airliners replenish oxygen in a plane at high altitudes by pulling in the thin air and pressurising it, mostly by scooping it from the front end of jet engines.No passports, more turbulence and standing cabins – 18 ways flying is going to changeBecause earlier studies showed people performed more poorly on tests of brain function at levels as low as 1,000 parts per million, the researchers thought it would make sense to examine pilot skills and carbon dioxide.Thirty airline pilots were recruited to fly multiple three-hour segments in a special flight simulator in which carbon dioxide levels could be manipulated.Performance on 21 manoeuvres ranging from making a steep turn to handling an emergency engine fire, decreased as carbon dioxide levels rose, according to the study.Flight examiners certified by the Federal Aviation Administration rated the pilots’ performance.At 700 parts per million, pilots were 69 percent more likely to correctly perform the manoeuvres compared to when they were breathing carbon dioxide at 2500 parts per million. At 1,500 parts per million, they were 52 percent more likely to pass compared to the higher level.The study was published Wednesday in the Journal of Exposure Science \u0026amp Environmental Epidemiology.Allen, who is also co-director of Harvard’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, took pains to say that air travel is extremely safe.How much have plane seats shrunk since the golden age of flying?There has been only one passenger death on a US-registered airline in more than nine years and there’s never been any evidence linking routine carbon dioxide levels to a crash.However, several of the few recent fatal accidents that have occurred involved puzzling lapses in pilot performance, according to accident investigation agencies. One example was when a captain on a Colgan Air flight made a series of abrupt manoeuvres in 2009 near Buffalo, causing a perfectly good commuter plane to plunge to the ground, killing 50.At the very least, Allen said, regulation agencies like the FAA might want to study the issue and compare the growing research on the effects of carbon dioxide with the existing US regulations on aircraft design.Pregnant Chinese woman, 67, vows to continue with pregnancy despite opposition from doctorsTourists could be made to file past Rome\u0026#39s Trevi Fountain on one-way route in bid to control overcrowdingHow Pakistan plans to boost human health by bringing vultures back from the brink of extinctionGoodbye, Grimmy: the rise and fall of the BBC\u0026#39s most fashionable DJLate-summer break to Argentina?

A further 1,400 are seriously injured and more than 150,000 displaced.Local authorities, international relief groups and the central government have begun organising aid, but shattered roads have slowed efforts to reach survivors in the mountainous north of Lombok, which bore the brunt of the quake.Aid begun trickling into some of the most isolated regions, officials said midday Thursday, but many people displaced by the quake still lack basic supplies.In some parts of northern Lombok, survivors can be seen standing on the road with cardboard boxes asking for donations and food.We are still waiting for assessments from some of the more remote areas in the north of the island, but it is already clear that Sunday\u0027s earthquake was exceptionally destructive, Christopher Rassi, the head of a Red Cross assessment team on Lombok, said in a statement.I visited villages yesterday that were completely collapsed.Members of an Indonesian search and rescue team look for victim of the recent quake in Tanjung on Lombok island on August 9Tens of thousands of homes, businesses and mosques were levelled by the quake, which struck on Sunday as evening prayers were being said across the Muslim-majority island.There are fears that two collapsed mosques in north Lombok had been filled with worshippers.Rescuers have found three bodies and also managed to pull one man alive from the twisted wreckage of one mosque in Lading Lading village, while at least one body has been spotted under the rubble in Pemenang.Authorities are gathering information from family members with missing relatives to determine how many more people may have been in the buildings when they collapsed, national search and rescue agency spokesman Yusuf Latif told AFP.Across much of the island, a popular tourist destination, once-bustling villages have been turned into virtual ghost towns.Many frightened villagers are staying under tents or tarpaulins dotted along roads or in parched rice fields, and makeshift medical facilities have been set up to treat the injured.Evacuees in some encampments say they are running out of food, while others are suffering psychological trauma after the powerful quake, which struck just one week after another tremor surged through the island and killed 17.There is a dire need for medical staff and long-term aid, especially food and medicine in the worst-hit areas, government officials said.Some evacuees have complained of being ignored or experiencing long delays for supplies to arrive at shelters.A man inspects the ruin of his house destroyed by an earthquake in North Lombok, IndonesiaThere has been no help at all here, said 36-year-old Multazam, staying with hundreds of others under tarpaulins on a dry paddy field outside West Pemenang village.We have no clean water, so if we want to go to the toilet we use a small river nearby, he said, adding they needed food, bedding and medicine.The Indonesian Red Cross said it had set up 10 mobile clinics in the north of the island.A field hospital has also been established near an evacuation centre catering to more than 500 people in the village of Tanjung.Kurniawan Eko Wibowo, a doctor at the field hospital, said most patients had broken bones and head injuries.We lack the infrastructure to perform operations because (they) need to be performed in a sterile place, Wibowo told AFP.Aid groups say children are particularly vulnerable, with many sleeping in open fields and suffering illnesses from lack of warm clothing and blankets.Please review our commenting policyRussia threatens to ban sale of space rocket engine to US over sanctionsPregnant Chinese woman, 67, vows to continue with pregnancy despite opposition from doctorsTourists could be made to file past Rome\u0026#39s Trevi Fountain on one-way route in bid to control overcrowdingHow Pakistan plans to boost human health by bringing vultures back from the brink of extinctionGoodbye, Grimmy: the rise and fall of the BBC\u0026#39s most fashionable DJLate-summer break to Argentina?

Since graduating, Mr Komuro, also 26, has been working as a paralegal at a law firm in Tokyo. The couple announced that they had received the emperor’s blessing and would marry in November 2018. In February, however, those plans were abruptly put on hold, with the Imperial Household Agency announcing that they couple were delaying the wedding on the grounds of a “lack of time for preparation”. In a statement, Princess Mako said,” We have come to realise there is a lack of time to make sufficient preparations for various events leading up to our marriage this autumn and our life afterwards.Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko have asked Kei Komuro, their possible future son-in-law, to present a “life plan”“We believe we have rushed various things”, she added.It was soon reported in Japan’s tabloid media, however, that the real reason for the delay was a financial dispute between Mr Komuro’s mother and her former partner. The reports claim that she borrowed the cost of her son’s education from her former fiance and has not yet repaid the money. Mr Komuro’s mother has had several face-to-face meetings with the princess’ parents, with Prince Akishino saying that the wedding and the couple’s subsequent life together could be impacted by her reported debts. In reply, Kyodo reported, Mr Komuro’s mother said she did not consider the money to be a “debt” but she was seeking discussions with her former fiance to conclude the matter. Mr Komuro was given a police escort as he left Tokyo on Tuesday to start a three-year law course at New York’s Fordham University, where he intends to take the state bar exam before returning to Tokyo to pursue his career. Sources have claimed that the couple plan to stay in close contact while Mr Komuro is in New York and intend to follow through on their plans to marry. The Imperial Household declined to comment.Russia threatens to ban sale of space rocket engine to US over sanctionsPregnant Chinese woman, 67, vows to continue with pregnancy despite opposition from doctorsTourists could be made to file past Rome\u0026#39s Trevi Fountain on one-way route in bid to control overcrowdingHow Pakistan plans to boost human health by bringing vultures back from the brink of extinctionGoodbye, Grimmy: the rise and fall of the BBC\u0026#39s most fashionable DJLate-summer break to Argentina?

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearTheir findings, published in The National Bureau of Economic Researh,\u0026nbspestablished that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are entirely distinct from stocks, currencies and other commodities in terms of factors affecting their market movements.In contrast, we show that the cryptocurrency returns can be predicted by factors which are specific to cryptocurrency markets, the study explains.Specifically, we determine that there is a strong time-series momentum effect and that proxies for investor attention strongly forecast cryptocurrency returns.This momentum effect was found to strongly affect cryptocurrency, meaning that if bitcoin is performing well then it is likely to continue doing so, at least in the short-term.\u0026nbspThe economists designed a\u0026nbspsimple\u0026nbspstrategy that investors could follow to take advantage of this trend. According to the strategy, an investor should buy bitcoin if its value increases more than 20 per cent in the previous week.CoinMarketCap)The economists also\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat there is a 0.3 per cent\u0026nbspchance that the value of bitcoin will fall to zero and become useless. This may seem very small, however it is still several degrees of magnitude higher than traditional currencies like the euro (0.009 per cent chance) and the Australian dollar (0.003 per cent chance).The end of the study addressed the question of how much a typical investor should hold in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, concluding that it should be between 1 per cent and 6 per cent.Of course, one has to remember that, as with any other assets, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns,\u0026nbspTsyvinski said.Maybe cryptocurrency will completely change its behavious, but currently the market does not think it will.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/05/12/rtssxx9.jpg  width= 2405  height= 1697  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/05/12/rtssxx9.jpg","title":"uk rents rise property prices 15 per cent five years rics","story":"Created with Sketch.Changes to tax on buy-to-let properties has led to a lack of new properties going on the rental marketClick to followThe Independent OnlineUK rents are expected to rise by 15 per cent in the next five years due to a lack of supply, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ (RICS) has warned.The group said its July survey showed a continued reduction in new property being put on the market in the lettings sector, with 22 per cent more respondents reporting a fall, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of decline. This lack of available properties means rents are estimated to go up by almost 2 per cent across the UK this year, but RICS said “the shortfall in the supply pipeline is more visible over the medium term”, with rents predicted to rise 15 per cent by the middle of 2023. East Anglia and the southwest are viewed as likely to see the sharpest growth over the period, RICS warned. The organisation said the lack of supply, which is “evident in virtually all parts of the country” was “symptomatic of the shift in the mood music in the buy to let market in the wake of tax changes which are still in the process of being implemented”. Tax relief for buy-to-let investors has been reduced, while stamp duty on second homes has increased in recent years.Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: “The impact of recent and ongoing tax changes is clearly having a material impact on the buy to let sector as intended. The risk, as we have highlighted previously, is that a reduced pipeline of supply will gradually feed through into higher rents in the absence of either a significant uplift in the build to rent programme or government funded social housing. “At the present time, there is little evidence that either is likely to make up the shortfall. This augers ill for those many households for whom owner occupation is either out of reach financially or just not a suitable tenure.”Abdul Choudhury, RICS London policy officer, said the survey showed the government must “urgently” look at the private rented sector and find ways to “encourage good landlords”.Owning a home cheaper than renting in every part of UK, study findsLondon rents rising almost three times faster than wages Landlord offering ‘sex for rent’ says he is not breaking the lawResearch released earlier this week from think tank Centre for London\u0026nbspshowed the lack of affordable housing in the capital was a major factor causing people to leave the city.

Funding secured”.That instantly sent shares in the company up 11 per cent.Tesla has since confirmed that it is evaluating a plan to go back into private ownership, but there have\u0026nbspbeen no details released of any financing plan, leading some to suggest that Musk might have contravened securities laws designed to prevent market manipulation.The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked Tesla why the announcement was made on Twitter rather than in a conventional regulatory stock market filing and what the basis was for Musk’s financing claim.The SEC’s rulebook states that\u0026nbsppublicly traded companies must not announce\u0026nbspfinancing plans if executives don’t intend to complete it or lack a “reasonable belief” that it will be completed.If Musk is found to have broken the rules he could face criminal prosecution.“He is claiming there is a specific source of the funding so that had better be true. He has also claimed there is a specific amount available for funding. That has to be true. Otherwise, even if it’s not manipulation it would be fraud, so he’s got two potential areas of difficulty right there,” a former SEC chair,\u0026nbspHarvey Pitt, told the US network CNBC.According to lawyers consulted by Reuters, Musk could also face civil lawsuits from investors if it is ultimately proven he did not, in fact, have secure financing when he published his tweet.A $420 per share sale would value the carmaker at around $70bn (£54bn).On Wednesday the shares were trading at $370, giving it a market capitalisation of $63bn.Palo Alto-based Tesla, named after the physicist Nikola Tesla, went public in 2010.In its second-quarter results for 2018 the company\u0026nbspposted\u0026nbsp$4bn of revenue and a loss of $717m.Tesla also burnt through $430m in cash in the quarter, leaving $2.24bn remaining on its balance sheet.While the company has many devoted supporters among analysts and fund managers, it is also the most “shorted” stock on the US stock market, meaning there is also a considerable weight of opinion that the company is overvalued.Musk owns just under 20 per cent of the company’s stock.It is estimated that he would need to raise around $50bn to achieve his privatisation plan.“There is scepticism as to where this money comes from,” Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA, told\u0026nbspCNBC.securities and exchange commissionEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/12/iphone.jpg","title":"iphone apple charger port lightning cable usb c european union","story":"Created with Sketch.The new iPhone 7 is displayed on a table at an Apple store in Manhattan on September 16, 2016 in New York CityThe EU is trying to allow everyone to charge with the same wireClick to followThe Independent TechApple could be forced to drop the charging port in the bottom of its iPhones as part of new plans to help users.The company may be required to use another standard like USB-C instead, so that ports can be standardised across manufacturers.The European Union is looking at new ways of making phone companies all use the same phone chargers, which could include forcing companies to decide on a standard and use it in all phones.Gadgets and tech news in picturesDesigned by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

In 2009, the EU successfully pressured 14 companies including Apple and Samsung to work towards all using the same charging ports from 2011.But those phones all still use different wires. While many companies have moved towards the USB-C standard, Apple\u0027s iPhones\u0026nbspstill use the Lightning port that has been present in all of the recent models.Now Reuters reports EU regulators are frustrated with the lack of progress and might look into different ways of forcing companies to adopt the same standards.“Given the unsatisfactory progress with this voluntary approach, the Commission will shortly launch an impact assessment study to evaluate costs and benefits of different other options,” competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a response to questions from EU politicians.It would be very unlikely indeed that Apple would ever allow anyone else to use its Lightning connector, which is proprietary and available only on Apple devices.As such, any effort to standardise the chargers would almost certainly mean that Apple would have to move towards another open connector, such as USB-C.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/12/15/the-meg-0.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6313726  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= The Meg  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/12/15/the-meg-0.jpg","title":"kathleen turner friends interview hollywood michael douglas jennifer aniston","story":"Created with Sketch.Actress spoke at length about her storied career, experiences with sexism, and what she thought of the \u0027Friends\u0027 castClick to followThe Independent CultureKathleen Turner calls Friends cast \u0027unwelcoming and cliquey\u0027 in frank interview about her Hollywood careerKathleen Turner has criticised the way she was treated during her time on the hit sitcom\u0026nbspFriends.\u0026nbspThere are several talking points from the interview, including her refusal to be typecast, which saw her take aim at one unnamed actress for playing the same role for 20 years.\u0026nbspFirst look at Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate in new Tarantino filmJohnny Depp film pulled from cinemas weeks before releaseMatthew Perry \u0027rushed to hospital\u0027 after suffering ruptured bowelShe even looks pretty much the same, she said.

Greeley. It was\u0026nbspthere that she developed a fascination with astronomy.“Math was more fun than anything else. It was always a game to me,” she later recalled.\u0026nbsp“I was the only female in my class. I sat on one side of the room and the guys on the other side of the room. I guess they\u0026nbspdidn’t want to associate with me. But I could hold my own with them and sometimes did better.“To function efficiently in today’s world, you need math. The world is so technical, if you plan to work in it, a math background will let you go farther and faster.”Ross joined Lockheed in Burbank, California, in 1942, where she completed additional\u0026nbspaeronautical and mechanical courses at UCLA in tandem with her work on high-speed fighter jets.\u0026nbspShe was studying the\u0026nbspfeasibility and performance of\u0026nbspdefence missile and satellite systems and later became one\u0026nbspof the 40 founder members of the company’s\u0026nbsp”Skunk Works” team, assigned to secret projects.She co-authored Nasa’s Planetary Flight Handbook at this time and analysed theory on Mars fly-bys.

This lack of available properties means rents are estimated to go up by almost 2 per cent across the UK this year, but RICS said “the shortfall in the supply pipeline is more visible over the medium term”, with rents predicted to rise 15 per cent by the middle of 2023. East Anglia and the southwest are viewed as likely to see the sharpest growth over the period, RICS warned. The organisation said the lack of supply, which is “evident in virtually all parts of the country” was “symptomatic of the shift in the mood music in the buy to let market in the wake of tax changes which are still in the process of being implemented”. Tax relief for buy-to-let investors has been reduced, while stamp duty on second homes has increased in recent years.Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: “The impact of recent and ongoing tax changes is clearly having a material impact on the buy to let sector as intended. The risk, as we have highlighted previously, is that a reduced pipeline of supply will gradually feed through into higher rents in the absence of either a significant uplift in the build to rent programme or government funded social housing. “At the present time, there is little evidence that either is likely to make up the shortfall. This augers ill for those many households for whom owner occupation is either out of reach financially or just not a suitable tenure.”Abdul Choudhury, RICS London policy officer, said the survey showed the government must “urgently” look at the private rented sector and find ways to “encourage good landlords”.Owning a home cheaper than renting in every part of UK, study findsLondon rents rising almost three times faster than wages Landlord offering ‘sex for rent’ says he is not breaking the lawResearch released earlier this week from think tank Centre for London\u0026nbspshowed the lack of affordable housing in the capital was a major factor causing people to leave the city.

Populations of the invasive species have been discovered across the US eastern seaboard.An east-Asian species of tick capable of swarming animals and sucking their blood so fast they die has established itself in the US, with eight states on the eastern seaboard reporting the presence of the pest.Public health officials have said they are concerned about the growing presence of the Asian longhorned tick, (Haemaphysalis longicornis), which carries and transmits unpleasant diseases in its homeland.In the US none have yet been found with any human diseases. In Asia, however, the species carries a virus that has been known to have a fatality rate of up to\u0026nbsp30\u0026nbspper cent.Woman suffers facial paralysis after being bitten by tick in gardenViral photo of ticks on muffin terrifies the internetTravellers to the US face threat from mosquito-borne diseasesRetired woman ticks off bucket list goal after man asks her on dateThough the invasive species has already spread to the densely populated New York suburbs, at the moment the greatest threat remains to livestock pets, and wild animals.The ticks can attack en masse and drain animals of blood so quickly they die – a cause of death known as exsanguination.Initially\u0026nbsphard to see with the naked eye, following a blood meal\u0026nbspthe ticks swell up to about the size of a baked bean, and females can then lay hundreds of eggs.Populations of the ticks can explode rapidly as the species is able to reproduce asexually – giving rise to an army of ravenous clones.“One tick can crank out females in fairly large numbers,” Thomas Yuill, a retired pathobiologist at the University of Wisconsin, told the New York Times.Tadhgh Rainey, an entomologist at the public health department of Hunterdon County\u0026nbspin New Jersey, was first to report the discovery of large numbers of the tick, in a paper published in May this year.“All life stages were found on the sheep, which had no history of travel outside the country,” he said.\u0026nbspIn a subsequent interview he said the owner came to his department with ticks on her hands and wrists.\u0026nbsp“I thought she’d have a few,” Mr\u0026nbspRainey said. “But she was covered in them, easily over 1,000 on her pants alone.”New Jersey wildlife officials are calling for anyone who spots the bloodsucking arachnid to contact them immediately.“This tick is a known pest in deer and has a wide host range, thus can infect a range of wildlife species,” said department officials, who described the pest as “exotic”.The diseases the ticks have been known to spread include Rickettsia japonica, the bacteria which causes oriental spotted fever, and Theileria orientalis, a parasite that causes cattle theileriosis – in which cattle suffer fever and sometimes breathing difficulties and weight loss.Studies have also indicated that some populations of the tick in China may harbour a virus that causes SFTS – severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.The disease, first identified in 2009, causes fever, vomiting, hemorrhaging, and organ failure, and initially had a fatality rate of 30 per cent, though that has fallen significantly since its identification.World news in picturesA Palestinian girl smiles as she waits to receive aids at a United Nations food distribution centre in Jabalia refugee camp in the northern GazaAn Israeli soldier rides an armoured vehicle during an army drill after the visit of Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, IsraelUsable items are salvaged from a home destroyed in an earthquake in North Lombok, Indonesia.

Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic nominee in New York’s 14th Congressional District.Ms Davids, a lawyer who spent a year as a White House fellow as\u0026nbspBarack Obama handed off to Donald Trump, campaigned on a conventional Democratic platform, including expanded health care access, gun control and opposition to the current president\u0027s\u0026nbsptax breaks.A member of Ho-Chunk Nation, a Native American tribe in Wisconsin, Ms Davids was backed by Emily’s List, a national organisation dedicated to electing Democratic women.In a statement she called Mr Yoder “a pawn for Donald Trump.”“Now, we turn to the general election and set our sights on defeating Kevin Yoder, an extremist who has tried time and time again to undermine health care access and give tax breaks for the largest corporations,” Ms Davids said in the statement, The Kansas City Star\u0026nbspreported.\u0026nbspA spokesman for Mr Yoder, who has been endorsed by Mr Trump and has a significant financial advantage, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Democrats believe they have a chance to pick up the seat, which represents the Kansas City area and its environs, as part of its larger quest to regain control of the House in the November general election. In a statement, Ben Ray Luján, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, called Ms Davids “a strong voice for working families” who is “ready to bring that fight to Congress.”“After this hard-fought primary win, Sharice emerges even stronger in her historic bid to flip this competitive seat,” he said.Trump-endorsed Kris Kobach in governor\u0027s race that came down to wireRepublicans survive scare to hold Kansas in special electionFirst Muslim woman to be elected to Congress in US historyHistory made as Democrats choose black woman for governor\u0027s race In a recent interview with The New York Times, Ms Davids said her background would be an asset in the House.“Having LGBT people sitting in the room while decisions are being made, and sitting there as peers, will shift the conversation,” she said. “I think it’s important that the lived experiences and the point of view of LGBT folks be included in conversations that affect all of us.”While Ms Davids would be the first congresswoman to have been an MMA fighter, she would not be the first member of Congress with octagon experience.

I persuaded him to stick with it and thankfully we got the visa, but this is just one example of the kind of crazy things people are being made to do in the name of coming to talk about their books.The festival is going ahead as normal and we\u0027re trying to resolve these issues, but I worry that is increasingly a problem. This year we\u0027ve got round about 12 authors who have faced serious problems.But I think if this goes further we start to damage the reputation of the festivals, and we start to have authors wondering whether they can be bothered to go through that process of applying to come.

Fine. But this leopard is not about to change his spots.Throughout his life he has shown terrible judgment. It is extraordinary how often he picks the wrong side.He is not just a threat to British Jews if he gets into power.He’s a threat to Britain, full stop.BRUSSELS bureaucrats always put their precious project ahead of common sense.It explains their approach to Brexit negotiations.Yet our analysis of what a ‘no deal’ Brexit would mean for French pharmaceutical companies, German car manufacturers and everything in between should focus minds.You can’t just find £500 billion down the back of the sofa, Jean-Claude.The Brexit Department has its own detailed study too, but are keeping it private.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces. Or if the trains turned up when they’re supposed to.But we won’t hold our breath.POLICE unions never fail to complain about overwork and stress on the job.We can understand why. It’s not an easy job. Coppers have our respect.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wasn’t surprised I choked on my toast because anything bad that happens to me — big or small — I’ve already lived through in my imagination.But I choked at the sheer obviousness of the scientists’ conclusions. Of course feeling stressed helps people deal with bad news. What next? Scientists discover sleep is related to tiredness?I can deal with bad news better because I’ve already been in that moment. I’m well prepared because I’ve actually lived it in my head.Anyway, the choking passed and, to my surprise, I didn’t die. That’s another beauty of always believing the worst will happen. What a wonderful surprise it is when the worst doesn’t happen.The toast didn’t kill me. I cheated the choke. Oh, the joy.I don’t know how long I’ve been this way. It’s definitely been going on since I was a kid.I remember flying off on holiday to what was then Yugoslavia with my mum and dad. I recall my mum trying to talk to me about all the exciting things we’d be doing when we got to my nan’s house on the Adriatic.I kept shaking my head and not saying anything and she got annoyed and rolled her eyes, thinking I just wasn’t looking forward to our holiday.But she misunderstood me. I didn’t want to think about the nice things we’d be doing because I was so convinced the plane was going to crash that it made me sad to consider what I surely wouldn’t experience.Imagine, then, my joy when the plane didn’t actually crash and I ended up not dying. What a bonus!And I went in the sea and didn’t drown — another nice surprise.I almost look forward to the moment when I do croak. If I have any warning I’ll tut and say to myself, “Oh well, I knew this would happen sooner or later.”This kind of attitude is admittedly a disaster when it comes to wooing women. Assuming total failure ahead of any move made on the opposite sex is disastrous. It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it.

No one mentioned the wider implications of this pay rise.”The revelation comes just a day after the BMA union warned that 90 per cent of doctors were unhappy with their pay deal.Theresa May ripped up the seven-year public sector pay cap earlier this year by awarding NHS staff a 6 per cent pay rise over 3 years.Big hikes of up to 3.5 per cent were then announced for doctors, teachers, prison guards, police officers and the Armed Forces last month.Steve Webb, the ex-Lib Dem pensions minister and now Royal London policy chief, said: “Millions of nurses, teachers and other public servants have faced nearly a decade of pay squeezes and will have believed that things were finally going to get better.“It was unforgiveable not to explain that increased pension contributions could mean some of them would actually be worse off following the new pay deal.”A Treasury spokesman last night said: “It’s right that as workers earn more money they contribute a bit more towards their public sector pensions – which continue to be some of the most generous pensions available.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sources told The Sun the motion may also demand Labour then campaign “to remain in the EU”.Some 130 constituency Labour parties (CLPs) are already though to be supporting the move.Critically the push is backed by union leaders – including TSSA chief Manuel Cortes. Sources claim Momentum co-founder Jon Lansmann is also supporting the idea.A source told The Sun: “An overwhelming number of Labour members and voters are fed up with Brexit. We believe a substantial number want the party to face up to Brexit extremists.”Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly refused to rule out a second Referendum – with aides merely saying it is not current Labour policy.But Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer last month said Labour could back a ‘People’s Vote’ if MPs reject Theresa May’s final deal with Brussels.At the time, he said: “In those circumstances it seems to me the sensible thing is to keep all our options on the table.”Union powerbroker Len McCluskey – the head of Labour donor Unite – last month said he was “open to the possibility” of a second vote.Labour opens the floor to motions by party members and activists on the Sunday of its annual conference. A panel of party bigwigs select a shortlist of motions that make it to the vote.Jeremy Corbyn suffered a major blow to his authority three years ago when unions and the membership rejected a bid for a vote on the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent at party conference.THE Pound slipped to its lowest level against the US dollar in nearly a year as traders worried about the growing possibility of a No-Deal.Sterling was down more than 0.4 per cent versus the dollar at 1.287 — its weakest point since last August.The UK currency also plunged 0.5 per cent against the euro, reaching its lowest since October.But the Pound’s tumble lifted the FTSE 100, as multinational companies listed on the index tend to benefit when foreign currencies are stronger than Sterling.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson. Hmmm. But can he pass the ball sideways just as well? I bet she didn’t find that out. Anyway, above is a photo of Ms Lia.So Joe, mate – keep your head down and stay off social media for a while. If I had that loon sitting next to me on a plane I’d spend the entire flight in the khazi.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the Iranian-run Press TV to cast doubt on Israel’s right to exist.He used to get paid handsomely for his appearances on a network run by a hostile government which enslaves its own people.Meanwhile, more Labour anti-Semites have been crawling out of the woodwork.Here’s a suggestion. Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it? Spitting image.Oddly enough, people often mistake me for the model Chloe Ayling.I even had the police round when she went missing because someone reckoned they’d seen her in Thornaby. But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The ultimate mistake was a droplet of water between my eye and my contact lens. It could blind me, or even kill me one day.Despite years of treatment, I still have this parasite in my eye.I am told that it is dormant. It goes into this stage to protect itself, picture it curling into a ball.We will never be able to tell whether it is dead or not or if and when it may reawaken so I have to live with the feeling of never knowing.Skye started to have symptoms of ME, an incurable condition, just a month after coming off the medication doctors prescribed to treat her eye problem.The neurological condition causes extreme exhaustion, pain, brain fog, among a variety of other symptoms.She said: The fatigue is like no other - I actually wish there was another name for it.You cant muster up the energy to put on foot in front of the other.You cant get dressed and ready for the day without a blackness descending over your eyes. You cant carry a conversation let alone even speak.The bottom of the line is that there is no energy there in the first place to channel through your body to all the right places. The only thing you can do is lie and exist.Skye added: My life has been ripped to pieces and then burnt down into nothing but ash and smoke. My life was planned out.I lay in the dark because of light sensitivity alone and waiting for someone to return home and take me to the toilet.My bed is my world. My bed is my support. It has seen me through endless days of torturous pain, fatigue and inner turmoil.Rosie Halsall, 17, from Liverpool, also suffers from ME and was diagnosed just aged nine leaving her wheelchair-bound.At her worst, she was unable to lift her head from her pillow, was spoon-fed and unable to sit for more than 30 minutes without fainting.She said: ME has changed my life. I cant sleep in my bedroom, instead in a downstairs room. Im sensitive to lights and sounds, so regularly wear sound reduction headphones and sunglasses- particularly on bad days.People dont tend to see the bad days, the days when Im crying in pain, when Im too exhausted to wear proper clothes, and the help I need from my parents with washing myself.Both teens have decided to speak out in support of Severe ME Awareness Day and to raise awareness of the condition.A spokesman for the ME Association said: It is an invisible illness. When you see us, we might not always look ill, but when our symptoms flare, the effects are obvious.It can feel like a constant flu, the smallest exertion can floor us, our bodies are painfully sore, restful sleep eludes us, light and noise are intolerable, and brain fog causes confusion.There is no known cure and no effective treatment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000375699617.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"beauty salon advertisement receptionist ocd","story":"A jobs site posting said the ideal candidate for Saks Hair and Beauty Warrington, Cheshire, would be “extremely well organised (OCD)”.Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a mental health illness.

My son had the badge but it was taken away when he was fidgeting in class but that was because they’d taken his fidget spinner off him.The 34-year-old mum - whose son Mika, seven, is still at the school - has launched a petition to get rid of the badges.Other parents have spoken out, with one writing on Facebook: Everyone paid the same amount to do the same fun day. How very wrong is it to punish a child on a fun day when they have already been punished beforehand. Even prisons don’t punish you twice.... imagine getting ten years for a crime and then two days before you get out they give you another ten years.”The schools head teacher Nicola Haddock defended the decision, saying all children had at least two-and-a-half hours on the play equipment.Ms Haddock said: The Year 6 fun day, funded by both parents and our Parent Teacher Association, is a celebration for all of our children. While the children rightly recognised for their continued good behaviour over the school year were given the first place on the inflatables, this was not at the cost of the other children. They had a choice of other activities and time on the inflatables and, with all of our pupils, had equal access to ice-cream.I have investigated the concerns from the parents who have approached the school, as I do with any parental concern, and responded to them personally apologising for any shortcomings they may have felt happened on this day.

On average, four aircraft and 20 yachts go missing in the area every year.Theories about the Trinagles strange occurences include UFO abductions, a shield to guard the lost city of Atlantis and sinister secret government testing. He wants to remain neutral until he can dig up more evidence on what the structure could be and is hoping to have a third series of his Discovery show commissioned to help tell the story.Hopeful Darrell added: I want to see what it is, because it may be nature-made, just a freak of nature.But given its placement in this particular part of the Caribbean and given what Gordon has told me about visitors from another planet and the things that Ive seen, I think its definitely worthwhile investigating.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The creatures have spines containing strong venom on their dorsal fins and on their gill covers.The species are mostly brown and around four to eight inches long. Stings from the creature were relatively rare, but a growing number have been reported in Plymouth, Cornwall and Kent.People have been known to become unconscious due to the venom – and even die.In 2001 jogger Carrie Kelly was knocked unconscious by a weever sting while out on Aberavon beach in Port Talbot.While schoolgirl Eve Austin developed a rare condition leaving her in a wheelchair after being stung by the fish on a family holiday in 2016.According to NHS Choices, if you are unlucky enough to get stung at the beach you should not pee on the area, cover it with vinegar or close the wound.It  recommends soaking in hot water and removing the spines from the skin with tweezers or a bank card. The effects of the sting should go within 12-14 hours, says the site.Lifeguard Beau recommends wearing swimming shoes to protect your feet.Alternatively dragging your feet along the beach is said to disrupt the sand and scare any hiding fish away."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425534865.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu prepared to let britain stay in their markets after brexit but only if theresa may continues to accept new eu rules for years to come","story":"A Brexit breakthrough could be on the cards if the bloc agrees to a climb down and softens their red lines.The EU has previously said that letting Britain trade freely but not allowing hundreds of thousands of people to come to Britain, would be splitting up the blocs key pillars and have refused to accept it.Theresa May is still desperately trying to convince EU leaders to back her soft-Brexit Chequers plan to keep the UK close to the bloc after we leave.Reports from The Times suggested that the bloc could abandon their red lines in exchange for more Brexit concessions.They would expect her to replicate ALL new EU rules on the environment and customs rules - in addition to what shes set out on her white paper.The climb down could be discussed as early as next month at the meeting of all 28 leaders in Salzburg next month.But the move is set to infuriate Brexiteers - who have said they wont stand for any more giving in to Europe over Brexit.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has said the Chequers deal is as far as Britain should be prepared to go before we walk away.Ministers have been stepping up their no-deal preparations in recent weeks as talks continue to stall between Britain and the EU.Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was odds on to leave with no deal too - in a move which has spooked markets and seen the pound take another tumble.The withdrawal agreement has to be signed off by October in order to be ready by next March, when we officially leave the bloc."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425671248-e1533814609446.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bones discovered bristol skip broad street","story":"Outraged locals had to call the cops twice - when the first officer on the scene laughed and said its just wood after eyeing the grim discovery.The Bristol Post claim the builders using the skip were working on the crypt of the nearby St Nicholas Church.Officers on the scene covered the skip with a thick black tarpaulin before taking the bones off to be examined in a lab.Barista Sam Ellis, 25, told the post: “A police car stopped down the road with sirens on.

The Football Association says it would plough a windfall into grassroots sport for 20 years. But there are other, better ways to do this. As the Premier League kicks off this weekend, it continues to receive at least \u0026pound3billion from domestic and overseas TV rights. It’s not hard to see how England’s richest clubs have so much money to share around between themselves. So the FA should be demanding the government introduce a levy of 10% on the TV income Premier League clubs receive.  This would help nurture the next generation of Harry Kanes, Jordan Pickfords, and Kieron Trippiers. Grassroots football in England is, unfortunately, not as healthy as the Premier League\u0027s prize pot. Only one in three grass pitches are of adequate quality to play football in England, and last season one in six matches were cancelled due to poor facilities. Meanwhile taxpayers paid out more than \u0026pound160million to build Wembley. So any decision to sell off this nationally important venue should not be taken before other alternatives have been exhausted. The Premier League currently puts just \u0026pound100million into grassroots football- a pitiful contribution given how wealthy its clubs are.

The country is stockpiling food and medicines, while grass fires rage, cows go hungry and farmers talk of disaster. To make matters worse, he is being made to look incompetent by Jeremy Hunt, of all people, and Jacob Rees-Mogg is being spoken of as the next Prime Minister because he sounds clever. Grumble grumble and bugger me, Marina, but old Boris is benched! No-one is talking about Brilliant BJ. Damned impolite when I resigned on a matter of principle, having not displayed one iota of principle for the entirety of the 54 years I have given humanity the benefit of my existence. Well, I had a call on the telephoney-what-not the other day from Steve Bannon, you know, the man who looks like a suppurating tumour and got Donald Trump elected. He said I can take control of the news by saying mad and bonkers stuff, more mad and bonkers than normal anyway, not British bonkers but Trumpian bonkers. The fake news will faithfully report it all and the racists will love me, and all the racists-but-pretending-they-aren\u0027t will say they\u0027re supporting my economic policies.  So I asked the editor of the Waily Torygraph if they\u0027d like me to write something that would get lots of attention, and they said they could do with something like that, and here it is, Marina old girl! If this doesn\u0027t get me on top of the news agenda for a solid week then nothing will!   Let me read it to you. I spent five whole minutes on it, it\u0027s really good. Listen.  Ahem. If you tell me that we do not have enough state control over what women wear, then I will man the barricades with you, comrades! Let us rip from Muslim women their headscarves, bare the bodies masked by burqas, remark upon the beauty or otherwise of faces covered by niqabs!  It is the sovereign duty of every Englishman, fwar fwar fwar, to see whatever bit of a woman they fancy. Especially if they\u0027ve got dusky skin. Why, I regularly tell my wife to walk around in a balaclava purely so I can exercise my human right, guaranteed at the signing of Magna Carta, to jump out from behind a tree and rip it off again. And that\u0027s why we need to make the Queen walk around naked. Our monarch must set an example that British integration means women being told what to wear, and accepting that most days she looks like a knitted German egg cosy.  I am not in any way being racist. Did I say racist? I didn\u0027t mean to. It\u0027s what people will call me, of course, racist, but don\u0027t let us repeat the word racist in case it causes extra headlines about racism. So many items of female clothing are oppressive, and a truly liberal nation such as ours should not allow women of any race to totter along in high heels, thoughtlessly mimicking the billions of victims of Chinese foot-binding, nor the menace of winter tights that go all bobbly after a single wash and make them look like shabby French mime artists, coming over here and stealing the jobs of Ango-Saxon street artistes.  But let us not stop there, my brethren. Let us also call out the controlling nature of corduroy, the Nazi obsession with nylon, the perverted prevalance of polyester and wrongness of rayon. Nature made totty to titivate us, not to be hidden away! If this makes me a militant feminist then I am happy to confess I am one of the sisterhood.  And don\u0027t get me started on people who cover up their God-given bodies for religious reasons. The priesthood attracts paedophiles precisely because their vestments give them the perfect excuse to hide their true natures. And nuns! They\u0027re basically just angry penguins, aren\u0027t they? Penguins who flatten the wages of British Protestants.   And hair! Women shouldn\u0027t be allowed it, for it covers their skulls! Pluck out their eyelashes, epilate their eyebrows, render them clean of fuzz!  Say so long to saris. Wave bye-bye to baggy sweat pants, winter jumpers, 1920s vintage clothing, duffel coats and pyjamas. No woman needs them, and I say so in a spirit of weird and bullying adoration of the female form because otherwise we\u0027ll be overrun by half-drowned picaninnies.  In a spirit of gender equality I will also point out that not all men in crash helmets are acid-wielding murderers on a rampage, and of course we should not ban them as that would be an example of nanny state control. But if I make you worry about them, you\u0027ll be ripping helmets off little kids on trikes by the end of the week, won\u0027t you? Vote for Boris.  The hard truth everyone in this politically-correct world is too frightened to say is that it\u0027s simply ridiculous for people to choose to go around looking like letter boxes. Dogs urinating on them! Post being shoved into their cakeholes! Being turned to gold with the curse of King Midas if there\u0027s an Olympian nearby! The working classes being oppressed yet again by the elite, of whom I am most definitely one and therefore was born to be PM.    If a woman spoke to me I should feel fully entitled to ask her to divest herself of all clothes first so I could talk to her tits properly. After all, this is how humans have evolved to work. There\u0027s no mention of leather jackets in scripture, you know. Off with that woman\u0027s head.  It applies also to children with cancer, the malingering little brats, in those hospital gowns they just hide sweets in. Little old ladies in tweed, scarecrows in straw hats, roadworkers lurking behind shapeless hi-vis jackets while treacherously talking this country down. This doesn\u0027t mean we should ban clothes or the right of any man or woman to wear what they please when going about their own business. It just means no-one\u0027s been talking about Boris since I resigned, apart from the 1,704 mentions I\u0027ve had since then in British newspapers, and that\u0027s not good enough.  So if I say Muslim women look like bank robbers, act all offended when you say I\u0027ve offended them, and grab lots of headlines while people fail to notice that my \u0027hard truth\u0027 is the same as saying anyone in a mini-skirt is a prostitute , then I\u0027ll get away with encouraging millions of people to attack women in the street just to prove they\u0027re victims of someone else.  Whaddya think, Marina? Churchillian in its sweep, I think future historians will agree, and so illogical as to take up most of the country\u0027s mental bandwidth as they try to understand it and fail to spot that I have become an integral, entertaining and, most worryingly of all, taken-seriously part of their lives. Jolly clever of me, really, ain\u0027t it? They\u0027ll never notice, and the Tory faithful will lap it up. Next week, I will tell them we need to build a wall on our northern border and make the Scots pay for it, that the NHS must be dismantled for the good of our health and the RAF must shoot down any planes with Muslims on board. We\u0027ll call it Boris\u0027 Battle of Britain. Rah!

Dad AP Pathak, his wife and their three-year-old son were flying from London to Berlin when they were removed from the plane. The family claim they were racially abused by a flight attendant and they were kicked off because the boy wouldn\u0027t stop sobbing. But it is claimed that the plane was forced to turn around for safety reasons because the parents failed to buckle their son into his seat despite numerous requests.  Mr Pathak, a bureaucrat with India\u0027s government, has written to that country\u0027s aviation minister alleging humiliation and racial behaviour.. He claimed to Indian media that it was an act of racial discrimination. Mr Pathak claims his son began crying as flight BA8495 was preparing to take off from London City Airport on July 23.  He told ANI that his wife took the boy into her arms, and a male flight attendant began shouting, scolded my son to go to his seat and used racist remarks.   The dad, who works for India\u0027s ministry of road transport and highways, claims his son was terrified and began sobbing again, and his wife put the youngster in his seat and fastened his seat belt. The crying continued as the plane taxied to the runway, the dad said. He claims the same flight attendant then returned and shouted you bloody keep quiet otherwise you will be thrown out of the window. The family claim that they were met by security personnel at the terminal and told to disembark the plane, and their boarding passes were taken from them. But a source said cabin crew had asked the parents several times to put their child in a seat and fasten his seat belt, but that did not happen and the plane had to return to its gate.

British car-lover Farah Hashi, 25, is stranded because his passport it being held by the car rental firm where he hired the \u0026pound160,000 supercar .  And the company are insisting he pays the hefty fine before they give him back his documents to get home to Newport, South Wales. His brother Adman, 50, said Farah is stuck in the Middle East because he cannot afford to pay - and has no way of getting his passport back. Delivery company manager Adman said: “I don’t know how they can legally withhold his passport.  They came to his hotel and demanded he hand it over after the speeding ticket came through, and out of fear he gave it to them. Now they say he must pay \u0026pound40,000, it is ridiculous. There is no way he has that money. He is out of work at the minute and went to Dubai to visit friends. He was supposed to be there for five days and fly back last week but now he is stuck in his hotel room, he’s had to extend his stay and we have no idea how he will get home. Farah racked up the fines in less than four hours last Tuesday after setting off every speed camera on the Sheikh Zayed Road in the \u0026pound160,000 supercar.  The car has now been impounded by officials in Dubai and the dealership says it cannot get it back until the fine is paid. Bosses at the dealership that owns the Lamborghini Hurac\u0026aacuten claim Farah, of Pill, Newport, left his passport as a guarantee. But Adman Hashi disputes this - and says his brother\u0027s passport was seized after he had driven it. Mr Hashi said his brother had been forced to borrow money to pay for the extended hotel stay.  He added: He didn’t even pay to hire the car. One of his friends had sorted it out for him. He was caught doing 200kmph but he didn’t know the laws over there.

After the first bone was discovered a police officer banged it against the skip in Bristol city centre and left, thinking it was just a piece of wood, eyewitnesses claimed.  But officers were called back a short time later and a pair of Bristol Post reporters, including one on work experience, found additional remains at the property under renovation.  Police are now investigating to determine whether the bones are human or animal.  A police spokesman said the officer who responded to the initial call examined the first bone to be found, and found it difficult to determine if the very small object was bone or wood. There is believed to be an old cemetery at the building site, police added. A member of the public found the first remains in a skip in Broad Street, near St Nicholas Market, and alerted Avon and Somerset Police around 8am on Thursday.  Sam Ellis, 25, a barista at nearby Full Court Press, said: “A police car stopped down the road with sirens on. The policeman got a bone out of the skip, bashed it on the side and said ‘that’s wood’ and drove off.” Sam added: “The policeman walked off laughing saying ‘it’s just wood’. The guy who dumped it said he was working on renovations nearby. When he was digging out put it was clumped together, he thought it was pipes sticking out. When he threw it in all the soil fell off and we saw it was bones.”  Sam said that Kat North, the wife of the coffee shop\u0027s owner, had previously studied archaeology, and phoned police after examining the skip to tell them that it appeared to contain human bones. Police soon returned and put a black tarpaulin over the skip. Bristol Post reporter Joe Smith and Josiah Wong, who tagged along on work experience, went to the renovation site in nearby All Saints Lane, where they found more bones.  Josiah said: After taking a look at the outside of the building we found a wheelbarrow with three full refuse bags. Among the rubble we discovered more bone shaped items and informed the police officers nearby. Shop owners said the skip only arrived Thursday morning after being swapped for one which had been there for two days.

The press are keen to share every minute detail of their lives and they\u0027re constantly followed by paparazzi, who capture their small breaches of royal protocol or their wardrobe malfunctions . It must be incredibly stressful for them. But in a bid to try and ensure their personal lives stay personal, they\u0027ve issued a warning to their close friends. And it\u0027s actually quite harsh.  According to a top royal source, The Duke and Duchess have told their friends that if they talk to the press, then they will be out of their \u0027inner circle\u0027. The source told Vanity Fair : They both expect a code of silence. If you talk to the press you’re out. They added that Harry never used to care what was written about him, but he\u0027s had a change of heart since marrying Meghan. He’s very protective of Meghan and defensive these days. He worries there is too much hysteria around Meghan and he wants to row back a bit, they added.  Recently,  royal correspondent, Richard Palmer, revealed he thought the press were purposefully being kept away from the duchess. He said: Royal rota journalists are being kept further away from [Meghan] than we were before the wedding. That means we can’t hear what she is saying. If you can’t get direct quotes from members of the royal family that often makes for dull stories. You go up afterwards and ask what she said. The pair are currently off duty until September and are believed to be spending some alone time together in the Cotswolds in a rented farmhouse cottage on the Great Tew Estate.

Sarah Park found herself retelling the same tales at social occasions - such as a family barbecue - but initially put it down to a \u0027couple of glasses\u0027 of the wine. However, she had also started putting cups away in the wrong cupboard and mixing up her kids’ washing at her home in Greater Manchester.  The subtle signs crept in until, finally, the mum-of-two was diagnosed with dementia , the Manchester Evening News reports.  Sarah, from Rochdale, has now spoken out about her condition and the vow she made with her husband Richard to stay positive.  She wants to challenge stereotypes and put an end to the agonising uncertainty facing those who are living with young onset dementia. As the first symptoms crept into her social life around 18 months ago, they also began to affect her professional life. While working as a senior cardiac physiologist, she started making uncharacteristic mistakes. To compensate, Sarah started getting up earlier for work with Calderdale and Huddersfield Health Trust. She would jump in the car at 5am for her drive over the Pennines to get to her desk early so she could spend longer analysing scans. “I thought I could work my way through it by doubling the effort and that worked for 12 months, so I kept plodding on - but then there was another mistake,” says Sarah.  “It was nothing major and it got picked up so no patient was ever at risk, but I noticed mistakes and I just could not remember why I had made them. It was horrible.”  At that point, Sarah told husband Richard ‘I can’t do it anymore’. “It wasn’t worth it,” she adds. “It was just one mistake, but it can make all the difference to someone’s health. “It’s sad because I loved my job, but the dementia was a bit of a problem – although I didn’t know it was dementia at the time - so I had to call it quits.”  Though she knew something was wrong, Sarah’s condition was repeatedly mistaken for depression by doctors who struggled to find the right answers. “They said I had depression and they focused on the work thing – ‘it’s because of work, it’s because of work’, they kept saying,” Sarah said. Richard had already started noticing ‘little things’ that gave him cause for concern. “It’s probably going back further than I realise - repeating stories on social occasions like a family barbecue which I put down to a couple of glasses of prosecco,” he says. “But then I noticed things at home a bit more – like putting cups in the wrong cupboard or mixing up the kids’ washing and there was the work situation.” Richard’s concerns were heightened due to Sarah’s family history. Her dad died of Alzheimer’s at the age of 40 and her grandmother also developed dementia. Initial scans and a normal cognitive test failed to provide definitive answers. But Richard, a structural engineer, said ‘he knew in his heart of hearts what was going on’ and the couple ended up at the Cerebral Function Unit in Salford.  “We said we wanted a second opinion there in January and within three or four weeks, Sarah was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s,” said Richard. Describing her reaction, Sarah says she was both devastated and relieved. “I was gutted it felt like a kick in the teeth. But it was also a relief that we finally knew what was going on,” she said. On the day of her diagnosis, Sarah and Richard returned to their home in Milnrow, sat on the sofa and cried. But their despair didn’t last long as the couple vowed to remain positive. “We’re not the type of people who will sit around feeling sorry for ourselves and we don’t want anyone else to do that,” said Richard. “We came back in the afternoon so the kids were away at school, sat down on the couch, had a hug, had a cry but dusted ourselves off and by the time the kids came back from school we were fine.” He added: “I took the kids to one side separately and told them about the diagnosis and how they would just have to support Sarah every step of the way. “And that’s what we’ve been doing – but we’ve still got to crack the whip and ask them to do stuff like tidy their rooms.” Along with their children George, 14, and Emily, 12, Sarah and Richard want to change social perceptions and prove it’s possible to live life to the full after a dementia diagnosis.

Anxious Amanda Muller says toddlers Luca and Romy were stalked by the insects while visiting a beauty spot in Louth, Lincolnshire.  She says little Romy\u0027s lip ballooned and Luca had a spike in his temperature after they were stung in the face, Grimsby Live reports.  She has now called for more warning signs at the scenic beauty spot where she claims families are being terrorised by large swarms. The incident occurred at Hubbard’s Hills, Louth.   Drunk US woman tells cops they shouldn\u0027t arrest her because she\u0027s \u0027pretty, thoroughbred and white\u0027  Mum-of-four Amanda, who co-owns a dance academy, said: “We were there a couple of weeks ago and it was ace. So we thought we would all go again and took pack ups. But within half an hour I was in A\u0026ampE with the twins. Luca and his sister Romy, who are due to celebrate their second birthdays on Sunday, were eating snacks. Wasps stung Luca on the top lip first as he munched Mini Cheddars. One then stung Romy on her bottom lip as she ate a ham sandwich. “The kids were not bothered by the wasps buzzing around them but we were wafting them away, said Amanda.  But it was like being stalked. They did not go away, even though you spun around. We moved to another spot but they still came for us. “There were other people stung while we were there. The mum is warning other families to be aware of the risk of wasp stings. “There should be more signs up to warn people and what to do if you get stung,” said Amanda, of Holton-le-Clay. A Hubbard’s Hills spokesman said signs warn visitors to be aware of wasps. Both Luca and Romy were treated at Louth County Hospital with anti-histamine and steroids. Most insect bites and stings are not serious and will get better within a few hours or days. Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they\u0027re unlikely to help. But the invasion, due to perfect breeding conditions, has brought plenty of business to pest controllers in northern Lincolnshire. Vermfree owner, Luke Pomfret said he was responding to 50 calls a day and was taking out 10 wasps nests per day due to the impact they are having on households and businesses. Luke - who ironically is allergic to wasp stings - even responded to one wedding venue where guests were fearful to go out due to the swarms of wasps outside. Luke said: “It is unreal. I have never seen anything like it. People who have worked in the profession for over 20 years say they have never seen so many nests.” He added: “It was really poor last summer and I had about 20 nests. But now I am doing up to 10 a day.”  He responded to the Waltham home of Mike Chase who had two nests on his property. He told how he keeps watching out for apples falling from his tree in the back garden because wasps swarm over them within minutes. Try kicking one of those apples, and you would be in trouble, he said. Luke wears a protective suit because of his allergy. He was treated in hospital two years ago after being stung on his ankle. The 29-year-old told how he rapidly became very itchy all over his body and scalp and suffered hives throughout his body. He was treated in hospital. There are lots of things you can do to prevent an invasion and its often easier than dealing with a problem to get rid of them. You should regularly inspect your home for any nests developing. Look in your loft, shed, garage or under the eaves. Also check your garden. Nests will start golfball size. When the queen starts laying eggs, they will grow in size rapidly. You should keep bins away from windows and doors. It\u0027s best to empty and wash them regularly so wasps are not attracted to them. Check your home for any gaps or holes, particularly in the loft. You can put insect mesh over grille vents or air bricks to make it harder for them to get in. Keep sweet-smelling plants, which may attract wasps, away from your doors and windows. Why are there so many wasps? Wasps start appearing in the spring but mainly just the queens who are looking for a suitable nest site. But they start to run out of food around August and that’s when they go out looking for alternatives - normally all the sweet things we have on our tables and in our kitchens."},{"url":null,"title":"weather summer heatwave twitter funny","story":"AdvertorialThe funniest tweets of the UK heatwave: All the hilarious ways Brits dealt with the recent hot weatherHere are some of the funniest tweets about how the nation reacted to the recent hot weatherShare\u0026nbspByHolly Thatcher12:40, 9 AUG 2018Updated13:56, 9 AUG 2018AdvertorialGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen it comes to weather, there’s really no pleasing us Brits. For 90 per cent of the year, we pray for sun – and when it appears, we don’t really know how to cope with it. The shops sell out of fans. The Met Office issues an emergency weather warning. People stop wearing clothes. And we all get very concerned about the state of the grass. But while most of us just moan, some people managed to find humour in the recent sweaty situation across the UK - and even came up with some genius hacks to cope. This was the state of play in Britain during the hot spell, according to Twitter:   1. No-one was doing any work  There’s pretty much nothing worse than trying to work inside an office during summer. But if you\u0027re finding yourself struggling to focus on the task at hand, it\u0027s not your fault, according to science. A NASA study showed that when the temperature reaches 26.6 degrees Celsius a person makes on average five mistakes per hour - at 32.2 degrees Celsius this goes up to nine mistakes, and at 35 degrees it\u0027s around 60 errors per hour.  That said, there is never an excuse to turn up shirtless to the office. You\u0027re best off working from home, y\u0027know, in the interests of productivity.  (If you\u0027ve really no option but to go to the office when it\u0027s hot, grab a Simply Motorised Handheld Fan , \u0026pound2, from Halfords and you might stand a chance of making it through the working day.)   2. Commuters were carrying fans  Spare a thought for those who had to commute using public transport during a heatwave. Because heat isn’t really a thing most of the time in the UK, you’re lucky if you can find a bus or train that has the luxury of air conditioning. But hey, you can always crack open a window. That’s definitely just as good. Alternatively, there was this option.     But even drivers can’t escape the heat wave entirely. After an hour parked in the sun, a car interior can hit up to 70 degrees Celsius, which is basically an oven. Or at least it feels like it.   A handy solution to prevent scalding your hands on your steering wheel is the Halfords Essentials Front Windscreen Sunshade , \u0026pound9.99. Its reflective surface will send the sun\u0027s rays back the way they came.   Rear window sunshades will also keep rays off back seat passengers when you\u0027re driving. The Halfords Cling Sunshades at \u0026pound7.20 will help keep temperatures down.  You might feel smug if you’re driving an air conditioned car, but over time they can lose efficiency – so you might not be feeling its maximum effects. Did you know that a car\u0027s air conditioning system can lose up to 10% off its refrigerant every year?  At Halfords there\u0027s a Free Air Con Check available, and they\u0027ll make sure everything is working. If your car needs it, for a small fee the experts at Halfords will be able to top up your air con refrigerant.     Remember 2007 – the wettest summer on record?   Legend has it that it was all the fault of Rhianna, whose hit Umbrella remained at number one for ten weeks. And during that time, it rained. Solidly. The. Whole. Time.  So some people might have stuck that on to see what happens. Meanwhile, the Norwegians believe whistling at the sun will cause rain.      Why not just make the most of the sun while it’s there and head out to the garden for a barbeque. (It would be rude not to when the Halfords Double Stove with Grill is half price at just \u0026pound25.)    Avoid burning yourself as well as the sausages by popping up a Halfords 300 Gazebo , \u0026pound69, (save \u0026pound21), and you\u0027ll not only get some shade, but also UV 50+ protection.   4. Ice lollies for all The best way to keep cool when the sun is shining is, undoubtedly, by enjoying an ice lolly. Just ask this cheetah.

Georgie Call\u0026eacute, 25, from West Hampstead, first became crippled with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in 2016 after waking from a nightmare. The illness made her think that she was a danger and would hurt someone, a thought that plagued her for eight months.  At her heaviest Georgie was 20 st 11 lb and would eat around 4,000 calories a day. Her diet would consist of takeaway food and she would snack on a family-sized bar of chocolate a day.  Convinced that she was a \u0027horrible person\u0027 by her OCD, she would avoid people in the street and stopped seeing her friends. But now Georgie has overcome her illness, dropped six dress sizes and she is due to race in the 2019 London Marathon. Georgie, who lives with her boyfriend Josh, also 25, in West Hampstead, north London, said: “It started from a really horrendous nightmare about me hurting somebody. I spent eight months terrified it would come true. “I didn’t understand at the time that I had OCD. I just felt like a horrible person.  “I’d cross the street to avoid being around people. It affected my concentration at work, my social life – it permeated everything. “I felt so alone in my head and tried to control it with binge eating.” Now, having sought help from a counsellor, Georgie has overcome her OCD – and completely revolutionised her life, even managing to drop six dress sizes. Currently 11st 9lb – 12lb away from her goal weight – she continued: “In the past, I felt like everything in my life was wrong because I was overweight. “But this time, I didn’t lose weight because I felt bad about myself. It was because I wanted to be healthy. “I’ve now learnt that you can achieve anything, so long as you give yourself a chance and a break.” Looking back, Georgie, who works in PR, can now see that her unhealthy relationship with food began when she was around 11 years old. Finding that she gained weight much more easily than her classmates, she was bullied for her size, which caused awful anxiety. “From a young age, I was constantly trying to lose weight in one way or another,” she said. “The heart of the problem was that I was deeply unhappy though.” Eventually, Georgie developed a form of binge eating disorder, secretly snacking on family-sized chocolate bars, and hiding sweets in her bedside table. Aged 14, she joined Weight Watchers for the first time, by then weighing 14st 6lb. Over the course of six months, she managed to lose around three-and-a-half stone. “I’d thought for so long that if I lost weight, I’d get some friends, people would like me more and the bullying would stop,” she candidly admitted. “But that didn’t happen, so I soon put all the weight back on.”  Though she was still overweight, Georgie found that moving schools for her A Levels and finding a new, supportive group of friends did wonders for her confidence. She continued: “For the first time, I realised I didn’t need to be defined by my size. I was finally proud of myself and the things I was achieving, like getting involved in politics and working in Parliament during my gap year. “I was still living an unhealthy lifestyle, but I figured I’d lose weight eventually and wanted to allow myself to enjoy my youth. I got to a point where, though in denial about just how unhealthy my eating habits were, I was actually very body positive. “Being a bigger girl was part of my identity.” By the time she was at university in 2012, her eating habits were so ingrained that her diet was worse than ever. On a typical day, she’d have a bacon sandwich for breakfast, a calorie-laden pasta dish for lunch and ready meal with an entire loaf of garlic bread for dinner. On top of this, she’d snack throughout the day, eating multiple Mars bars, jelly babies and a family-sized bar of chocolate.  Graduating three years later, she’d gained more weight, settling at around 17st. “In my head, I didn’t care because other parts of my life were going well,” she said. “I secured a good graduate job and had an amazing set of friends – I was happy. Why would I need to change?” But then, one day, totally out the blue in February 2016, Georgie woke from an awful nightmare feeling overwhelmed with anxiety. Before long, she’d developed OCD, which went on to rule the next eight months of her life. Feeling too afraid to speak out, she found solace in food, using it as a control mechanism. Over the months that followed she gained around three extra stone. “I’d felt strong enough to tackle anxiety in the past, but this was completely different,” she said. “It’s a very misunderstood condition. I didn’t even realise I had it myself until I read an online article about another person with it, and thought, ‘Oh my god, that’s me.’”  Finally realising what was wrong, Georgie sought help from the doctor and at the end of 2016, was given counselling and medication. I found the space to talk and learn about what was wrong made a massive difference. The medication was the best thing that happened, it reset my brain, she said. I could tell it was finally getting under control when the medication began to work. I could feel a weight lift out my head, giving me space to really embrace the cognitive behavioural therapy. I was still binge eating at this point, but didn\u0027t feel as scared of my condition. Happily, 2017 started much more positively, as Georgie landed her dream job and began dating Josh, who she met at university and was initially friends with. “I looked around and thought, ‘Things are going well for me – why haven’t I got this sorted yet?’” she said. “I’d hear people talking about the gym or healthy eating and realised that it didn’t come naturally to anyone. “If I wanted this, I’d have to work hard. I remember seeing a gorgeous Ted Baker dress that never would have fit me, even in the biggest size, so I used that as my motivation.” In August 2017, Georgie stuck rigorously to a healthy diet, losing 9lb in the first week alone.

Lynne Spencer, from Skegness was stung by a wasp in her local park after she sat on the grass. Within just 24 hours she had a large blister in the centre that was hot to the touch. She told Lincolnshire Live: I actually knelt on the wasp on Monday morning whilst I was helping someone. I took antihistamines when I got home. At night-time I realised it was getting bigger. It felt red and hot, so I went to the urgent care centre. I was told it was my body’s natural reaction.  Tuesday morning I woke up and it had spread throughout the night. Whilst at work I noticed it filling up with liquid and it was getting worse, so as soon as I finished at work I went straight back to the urgent care centre. Whilst waiting to be seen the sting came out with the liquid. I was given antibiotics and they put a dressing over the blister. She had been stung before but her body had never reacted like this, she was shocked at how big her leg had become following the wasp attack.  When I woke up and noticed it was getting slightly bigger. So I went to the urgent care centre and they doubled up my antibiotics and gave me different antihistamines. I have to take them for seven to 10 days. Pest control businesses are experiencing one of their busiest summers according to Kathy Brighton from Lincolnshire whose company has been called to rid houses of wasp nests. She said: “It’s absolutely mad. We’ve never known a year like it in the 20 years we’ve been in pest control. Calls have doubled, without a doubt.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman shocked tinder match makes","story":"NewsWoman shocked when Tinder match makes extremely cheeky request - and then things take a very strange turnAdele Elizabeth couldn\u0027t believe the message the man had sent, so decided to have a bit of fun with himShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor19:51, 8 AUG 2018Updated22:34, 8 AUG 2018NewsAdele Elizabeth (Image: Supplied)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLike most singletons on Tinder, Adele Elizabeth was excited when she saw a message pop up from a new match. But when she read what the man had to say, she was completely shocked. Instead of opening with a cheesy chat up line, an interesting fact about himself or even a safe hello, he decided to tell Adele how hot he thinks her mate is - and even asked if she could give him her number. Wow. But luckily Adele, 23, saw the funny side of it and passed on her pal India\u0027s details - but then things took a very strange, but very funny, turn when she decided to have a bit of fun with the bizarre situation.  Speaking to the Mirror, she said: I laughed when I first saw the message. I wasn\u0027t surprised because India always get the attention on nights out too. Typical man thing to do.  She met 21-year-old India, who is an identical twin, when the pair were working in Corfu and they remained friends after returning home to Nottingham. But Adele, who works for an online fitness company, decided to have a bit of fun with the guy, and said she just couldn\u0027t remember which of the sisters posed for the picture with her - what a pickle! So she told the man the situation and gave him both of their Instagram accounts. How helpful! She said: I passed on their details because I didn\u0027t want to get in the way of him and true love.  And because I thought it was funny for him to work out which twin he should message. The determined guy messaged one of the twins and explained the situation - but awkwardly got the wrong sister. Oh dear... She quickly told him his mistake, and quickly pushed the blame back onto Adele.  But unfortunately, neither of the girls were interested in him. Adele said: Neither of them is looking to date somebody right now and especially not somebody who would message that to their friend. Ouch. Sorry mate...

Sarah Nicholson thought she may have had irritable bowel syndrome after suffering symptoms such as abdominal pain and a change in her toilet habits. But scans revealed two tumours in her ovary and she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer - a disease that mostly affects those over 50 - at just 25. Sarah, of Newcastle, had surgery to remove the tumours and has told Chronicle Live of her brave decision to have a full hysterectomy that will prevent her from having children.

He was drained of colour and appeared to be walking in slow motion towards her. She didn\u0027t know what they had told him, but she knew it wasn\u0027t good news. Renae had just had an MRI scan to be on the safe side while trying to find the cause of her crippling headache. But as her husband Jared walked towards her in the hospital waiting room, her life - and his - changed forever. We both just looked at each and cried, she told MamaMia . As it turned out, her \u0027migraine\u0027 was a tumour. I was told if I had left it another 24 hours I would be dead, added the 39-year-old, who lives in Australia.  Renae had been in the waiting room for a while, awaiting the results of the scan, when she started feeling sick. With her head pounding, she sent Jared to tell doctors that they were going home because she wanted to crawl into bed. But in the minutes that followed, she found out she would not be getting into bed as she had hoped. Instead, she was rushed to the emergency department at a nearby hospital. Days earlier, she had rung her twin sister Nicole, who suffers from migraines, to see if she had any suggestions on how to cure her thumping headache that she\u0027d had four days straight. She described it as being annoying more than painful and usual remedies hadn\u0027t worked. Nicole suggested Renae contact her GP believing it may be a migraine, which are common in their family.  The GP suggested the MRI scan as Renae had never suffered such severe headaches before. But no one expected it to uncover she had a massive tumour - and that she had only 24 hours left to live. Renae spent the next five days in hospital having multiple scans while being monitored around the clock. Following an operation and 19 staples in the back of her head , the tumour was removed. But the worst was still to come. Renae was allowed home but was told not to do everyday tasks such as drive, cook or lift anything too heavy. Then five days later, fluid began leaking from the area she had been operated on and more surgery followed. She spent more than a week confined to her bed, unable to move without warning a nurse first.  This was the hardest of all of it, Renae said, writing on a GoFundMe page set up to help cover the cost of her medical treatment. I cried so much. I felt completely helpless. For the first time, I was scared and nervous about what was happening to me. It was then that Renae was given the devastating melanoma cancer diagnosis - despite religiously lathering herself in sun cream throughout her life. She was told it had no known primary source and had the Braf gene. In the words of the oncologists \u0027it has its foot on the accelerator,\u0027 she said. It was suggested to Renae she take a combination of drugs to \u0027buy her time\u0027. How much? No one can tell you, she said. According to the oncologist \u0027some people live, some people die. We don’t know why some do and some don’t\u0027.  And devastatingly a few weeks ago, another large tumour was found at the back of Renae\u0027s brain, along with three to four smaller ones. She was forced to undergo another operation to try and remove them, despite being told the treatment had been working and another tumour had shrunk to be almost non-existant. I was in the intensive care unit overnight and for much of the next day before being moved into my own private room again. I suffered severe and regular nausea and vomiting, she said. This is completely devastating news as there were no signs that my treatment wasn\u0027t working. The MRI scans were being performed less frequently as the tumours had been shown to be shrinking each time. It really feels like reliving it all over again from the beginning again.

He is strong in the air and a powerful player.“He is one of the best players in the air I have worked with.“He’s not Messi or Maradona but he’s a very hard worker and as a box player is excellent. I think he is perfect for Scottish football.“When I signed him before he was very good for me and he got his move to Aalborg on the back of that.“He has trained with us now but he is still a player at Aalborg so it is in the hands of the two clubs.”Safranko made 28 appearances for AaB last season but has dropped to the bench for the early games of this term after a formation change.That’s prompted him to seek a regular starting place elsewhere in a bid to add to his two Slovakia caps and he sees teaming up with his old boss again as the perfect way to achieve that.Although United have not ruled out a move for Austrian attacker Toni Vastic after his trial last week, with Safranko not coming cheap, that now looks unlikely.Csaba, meanwhile, has apologised to fans for his team’s poor showing in Saturday’s defeat against Dunfermline.He’s made it clear the display that led to three second half goals being conceded at Tannadice was unacceptable.“I have to apologise to the fans, for all the people who like and love Dundee United, for the performance and the result on Saturday.“The second half was nowhere near good enough, it wasn’t acceptable,” he added.“It was not what the fans, the staff and even the players wanted.“The players told me, gaffer we have to go and really tell everybody sorry but I take the responsibility.“Of course, we know every team can lose games but we know we should not lose like we did in the match.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united have to start getting it right from now on says edjenguele","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith so many changes to the squad taking place over the summer, experienced defender William Edjenguele knows it was always going to take new-look Dundee United time to gel.However, the experience the 31-year-old has amassed over his career and, in particular, of life in the Championship over the past two seasons with the Tangerines, tells him they better find a way to do it quickly.Like every other United player, the big Frenchman was gutted by Saturday’s 3-2 home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline in their league opener.It goes without saying that loss was not what the incumbents of the Tannadice dressing-room wanted or expected.“It was the first game of the season and at home, so you want to start well and that’s what we didn’t do,” he said.“In the first half we didn’t play particularly well but we managed to get the first goal and it looked the kind of game where the team who got it would be the winner.“And I thought in the first half, while we were not playing that well, neither team was. However, we were showing togetherness and real fight.“Second half there were a few mistakes and that cost us the game.“We were a bit unlucky as well because there was a handball in the move for their second goal and it should have been a foul for us.“You can’t use that as an excuse because he (the referee) did not give it and you have to defend the situation.”Neither will Edjenguele use the vast changes to the squad over the summer to deflect from what fans had a right to expect to be a much better start.The weekend saw nine men in tangerine making their league debuts for the club.That meant only two of the team that beat the Pars over two legs in the promotion play-off quarter-final just last May, were involved in the United starting line-up.Having been at eight clubs in his 13-year senior career, he knows better than most that any new group needs time to get to know each other and that’s definitely the case at Tannadice where he’s never seen so many comings and goings in such a short period.He’s well aware, however, that, while that process could take two or three months, it cannot be at the expense of results.“Definitely it will take time. I don’t even know how many players exactly came in but it was a lot.“There were a lot of changes, so we definitely need some time to gel together.“And I should say I do respect Dunfermline. They are a good side, especially going forward, and they have some decent players. So if you don’t play well they can beat you.“At home you expect us to do a bit better than that. Everybody is disappointed but we have to go again.“It was a hard day but we have to make sure we are better right away because the one thing that you find out is the season goes by fast and we have to be ready to go quickly.“We have to play better, starting with the next game. It’s as simple as that.”After the struggles of the Betfred Cup group that saw United come out on top in just one of their four ties and even then only after they already knew they were out of the competition, it’s fair to say many supporters feared the worst going into the Dunfermline clash.Edjenguele, though, insists the players had been in confident mood.The feeling was they were coming together as a team and would be ready for the opening 90 minutes of league action. That, of course, only made defeat more painful.“Some of the results in the cup were not good until the Elgin game,” he said.“We were making progress and things were moving in the right direction, so this was a real setback.“Like I say, now we must work to make sure we are ready this week.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united kids earn scotland call up to face england and turkey","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThree of Dundee United’s academy youngsters have been chosen to represent Scotland in the upcoming U/16 matches against England and Turkey.Midfielders Christopher Mochrie and Lewis Neilson and defender Adam Hutchison are included by Scotland coach Billy Stark.The game against the English will take place on August 20 at 3pm and the meeting with the Turks kicks off two days later.Both are to be played at the English FA’s St George’s Park complex.United’s senior academy manager Brian Grant said: “It is great to see these three lads rewarded for their hard work and application.

Thanks.”The firm was reportedly liquidated last Friday.Teejay – which takes its name from the initials of its director, Thomas Jordan – had operated routes in Angus including the 43/43A loop around Arbroath.It was also in charge of the 78A and 79A services that linked Dundee with Monikie, Monifieth, Ethiebeaton and Kellas.Teejay’s latest accounts revealed assets totalling just over £56,000 as of the end of 2017.Stagecoach East Scotland has arranged with Angus Council to take over Teejay’s routes until a permanent operator can be found.A spokeswoman for the council said: “We can confirm that we have arranged for Stagecoach to operate the local bus contracts in the short term.”Douglas Robertson, commercial director at Stagecoach East Scotland, said: “As a result of the recent administration of local bus operator Teejay Travel, we were asked by Angus Council to step in to cover the contracts previously operated by Teejay.“We are delighted to be able to provide the resource in order to operate these contracts on behalf of the local authority, ensuring customers see no disruption to their travel.”Teejay Travel could not be reached for further comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b69627bdece2-448x564.jpg ","title":"tom duthie patience and time in short supply for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the dust settles on a disappointing opening-day result against Dunfermline at Tannadice, a few moments’ calm reflection could lead to the conclusion all this Dundee United squad needs to be Championship contenders is a little time and patience.Give Csaba Laszlo’s rebuilt squad a few more weeks to gel and they could be a strong force at this level.And a little patience during those weeks to forgive mistakes that are probably inevitable would help with that process.So much for the theory, now for the harsh reality. It can be summed up with the following words – tough luck, because both are going to be in short supply.When it comes to the first, the fact is the time to be ready for any league season is on day one.At the weekend, United were not and that’s why, despite losing out to the odd goal in five, they were comprehensively beaten by a Pars outfit that was ready for action while they were found lacking.In pointing that out, it’s worth remembering that, although Dunfermline’s wasn’t quite to the same extent, over the summer circumstances meant they were forced to undertake a major overhaul of their squad that saw players leave and 10 new faces brought in.That was not least because they lost two of their key performers, Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird, to the Tangerines. Despite that, particularly during the second half of the weekend game, the visitors looked a strong and cohesive unit that was sound at the back and dangerous going forward.By way of contrast, the longer the game went on the more disjointed United became.However valid the reasons for that may be, the rest of the Championship is not going to sit back and give them time to get their act together.In Dumfries this weekend it’s more than reasonable to expect Queen of the South to do all they can to come out of the blocks quickly, hit United hard and early and try to stay on top of them.That’s just common sense and an approach that’s to be expected from the opposition for weeks to come, if not longer.Put simply, when a team looks as vulnerable as Csaba Laszlo’s do, they are going to be tested early in games and it’s only by winning matches they can expect opponents to start cautiously.As for patience, something being sought from fans, there has to be a realisation that among Arabs it’s not so much worn thin as disintegrated.A support that’s been used to top-six finishes in the Premiership and cup final appearances, has been put through hell and are now facing a third season out of the top flight.So much so that when new chairman Mike Martin addresses them, he often starts off with an apology, and wisely so.Through no fault of their own, supporters have been stuck in a long dark tunnel and, if they cannot see any light at the end of it, they cannot be asked to show understanding.Make no mistake about it, their team is where it is because results dictate that’s their true position in Scottish football.But when they look at where Dundee United have been and the lingering perception of it as a size of club, the very least Arabs have a right to expect is a side that’s challenging to get back up.Some 5,000 of them turned up for the league opener and gave yet another indication of where United could be.No other clubs outside of the Old Firm, Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs can rely on that kind of turn-out on a Saturday.If this team don’t start producing, they’ll not be able to either.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years. But it is now 20 years since such work was carried out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"There should be a rolling programme of things to keep a building in good order especially if it is historical,\" he said.\"But with a lack of funds we have only been able to do simple things.

Sir Alex Ferguson took chances with the Class of ’92 at Manchester United and he took chances playing young kids at Aberdeen.“He gave Eric Black, John Hewitt and others their chance and they came through.“It would be good to see another striker like Bruce come through because if you’re good enough, you’re old enough, in my opinion.”Dons gaffer McInnes is still hoping to sign another striker before the transfer window closes at the end of the month – and ideally he would like another frontman in before Saturday’s game with Dundee.With Adam Rooney leaving the Granite City for Salford City earlier in the summer, Aberdeen have two senior strikers in Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove.May, a £400,000 signing from Preston North End a year ago, struggled in his first campaign – particularly after an injury sustained in December against Rangers after a bad tackle from Ryan Jack, while Cosgrove – who joined in January from Carlisle – is only 20 and has yet to score in a competitive game for the Dons.McDougall joined Aberdeen in 1984 from St Mirren and helped the Reds win the Premier Division title in 1985 and the League Cup and Scottish Cup the following season.After his goal-laden time at Pittodrie, he was forced to retire in 1987, aged 29, due to injury.McDougall believes McInnes is right to try to add another striker and believes the goals of Rooney need to be replaced.He also reckons it’s important Aberdeen bide their time and wait for the right attacker to become available.McDougall added: “I think they need another striker added to their squad. Derek McInnes knows that and is working on it they lost Adam Rooney to Salford and his goals need replaced.“They need more firepower up front than what they have at the moment.“I just don’t see enough goals in the senior strikers. I’d love to see it but I feel they need a little bit more.“There have been encouraging signs for the season – they did well against Burnley in the Europa League and Lewis Ferguson looks a good player – but I would like to see another striker signed.“You can get strikers but Aberdeen don’t want to take in anybody, they need somebody with a bit of class because they want to keep moving forward.“Derek’s resources are limited so he’s right to wait for the right striker because he wants to make the right decision.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens techfest celebrates 25th anniversary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA science and technology festival which has inspired hundreds of thousands of youngsters for 25 years is poised to return to Aberdeen.TechFest aims to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects.Along with interactive workshops, shows and presentations, people will get a chance to hear from former Olympic curler Jackie Lockhart.She will share stories from her career alongside manager of Curl Aberdeen and fellow champion curler Tom Brewster, who will provide technical insight into how the maintenance of ice can affect the outcome of a match.As part of its milestone year, in addition to a range of science topics on offer, there will also be a variety of events exploring the history and uses of silver.National Museums Scotland will also present key objects from its touring exhibition, with Behind The Scenes of Scotland’s Early Silver: From Conservation to Display on September 12.Sarah Chew, managing director of TechFest, said: “This is a really exciting year for TechFest as we celebrate 25 years of the festival and we are pleased to unveil such a diverse and fun-filled programme for our anniversary.“Over the years you can imagine how the event has changed.“If you look at the programme in 2001, we were following the possibility of water on Mars pretty closely.“And in that area, there has been massive discoveries and now we see in 2018 that life on Mars is much closer than we realised at the time.“There’s the story of a woman who is now a nursery manager and used to come to TechFest as a kid – and now she’s one of our presenters who helps us to be on the cutting edge.”Sarah added: “Once again we have some of the brightest minds and biggest personalities in the Stem sphere presenting, as well as musicians and sporting personalities who can demonstrate how Stem plays a role in their disciplines too.“A lot has changed since we first launched as a charity in 1995.“However, our ethos of inspiring, educating and entertaining people of all ages has remained the same and we can’t wait to welcome everyone.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 9:27 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,As usual with Councillor Redman, he was so desperate to berate the SNP in his letter published in the July 20 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser that he is unable to see the hypocrisy of his own stance.He talks of \u0026#8216stealth taxes\u0026#8217 hitting \u0026#8216the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly elderly people living alone\u0026#8217.His accusation of \u0026#8216taking their eye off the day job\u0026#8217 begs the question as to where he was when the Tory government introduced its bedroom tax \u0026#8211 a tax on those who needed an extra room for live-in carers, a tax on grandparents who wanted to have their grandchildren to stay for weekends and at holiday times a tax on widows with sons and daughters in the armed forces expected to sleep on a sofa when home on leave.A disgraceful tax which the SNP government abolishedDavid Hay, MinardSir,It was superb to once again meet up with locals in Whitehouse and across west Kintyre. As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jolomo preaches in presence of royalty","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/08/18, 11:49 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowRenowned artist John Lowrie Morrison had a special royal task to perform last weekend.The Tayvallich-based artist, commonly known as Jolomo, is a trained lay reader in the Church of Scotland, and he was invited to preach in Crathie Kirk near Balmoral, in the presence of the Queen and other members of the royal family.Speaking ahead of the service he said: \u0026#8216I am extremely honoured to accept this invitation.

We are confident our proposals have reached an optimum balance between these aspects.\u0026#8216As a responsible developer, we believe it is important to seek public opinion on our proposals and take that feedback into consideration when developing our projects.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crunch meeting on ardrishaig club future","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA meeting is to be held next month to gauge interest in reviving a Mid Argyll sailing club.Disquiet has been growing in Ardrishaig while weeds grow up around sailing boats and canoes belonging to Mid Argyll Water Sports Club.The boats, bought with the help of grant funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust, are lying on the Ardrishaig waterfront, unused in 2018.The Argyllshire Advertiser spoke to Peter Hogbin, who was involved in the club for many years.

The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

Shankland, 22, was named the Ladbrokes League One Player of the Year after scoring 29 goals en route to Ayr winning the title. And his double against Partick Thistle sent Ayr top of the Championship on the opening day of the new campaign. The former Aberdeen striker\u0027s form has now attracted a list of suitors both north and south of the border, with Dundee already enquiring after the hitman\u0027s services.

And the bid to future-proof Craig Tara at the Heads of Ayr is being seen as a huge measure of confidence in the park. A zip-line flying high above a completely refurbished building is the highlight of the new proposals. Bosses at owners Bourne Leisure believe the move is essential to keep families interested in coming to the park. The development follows thousands of pounds being spent already this year on a new pool reception and Millie’s Cookies outlet.  It followed a \u0026pound2.2million Airspace sports development including golf simulator  and climbing wall three years ago.  The 85-acre site traded under the Butlins name until 20 years ago. Now it has also lured in food franchises such as Burger King and Papa Johns. Hastings-based A\u0026ampM Architectural Partnership have just had plans lodged with South Ayrshire Council. They said: “The proposed development will provide a much improved sports and leisure facility for the holiday park guests within a central location. “The proposed works represent a major investment in the park and also confirm Bourne Leisure Limited’s aspirations to provide improved guest facilities and to generally enhance the holiday park by creating a desirable holiday environment, which therefore attracts more guests and in turn contributes a positive economic benefit to the wider area.”  The plans centre on  the sprawling Turnberry Gardens building in the heart of the park.  It could include more sports facilities such as an archery centre. The plan shows a tots zone, a performance area with stage, an RNLI playground and a mini-golf site South Ayrshire Council will determine the application later this year.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsRNLISouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"holidaymakers coaches cannot parked ayr","story":"NewsHolidaymakers coaches cannot get parked in AyrBroken parking barrier causes furyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston12:31, 8 AUG 2018NewsCoach drivers cannot get past this barrier (Image: Elaine Clark)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne hundred and fifty children and parents were dropped off by holiday coaches ... but the drivers couldn’t get parked anywhere legally. They had been directed to a council bus park in Ayr by a policeman, only to have access blocked. Entry to the coach park is via an intercom and barrier – but nobody was answering. Now veteran driver Ian Jackson warned: “The town must get its act together or visitors will go elsewhere.” He led a convoy of three coaches nearly 60 miles from Whitburn in West Lothian. The 53-seater coaches dropped off their passengers outside Pirate Pete’s on the Esplanade last Monday. And Ian,73, of Wishaw, said: “A policeman told us to turn right towards the harbour as there was a coach park there. “We all turned off the esplanade and arrived at the coach park where there was a barrier with an intercom. “I spent 20 minutes pressing it with no answer. “It mean’t all three buses had to reverse out of the street and we had to drive out of the town. We all don’t understand how the council can be so stupid. “The turn-in for buses more than 13 metres long is narrow because of a foot-and-a-half traffic island anyway, so it was chaos reversing out. “Next time the visits might have to be to Largs or somewhere else that can properly cater for us. “These trips can be worth a lot of money for the towns we visit and it is usually a great day out.” There are 20 coach bays behind the car park in Cromwell Road and it has a barrier entrance. Ian also claims he hung on the phone for 25 minutes trying to reach South Ayrshire Council. Ian added: “I was ninth in the queue and I kept on holding I was so incensed. “When I got through they simply said they were not the roads department and I had to call another number. “What a mess.” South Ayrshire Council confessed officials knew there was a problem ... and alleged there were “alternative arrangements”. A spokesman said: “There is an issue with the entrance barrier at the coach park on Cromwell Road and work will be carried out to fix the problem. In the meantime, there are alternative arrangements in place for buses to access the coach park and we’re sorry if these did not work on this occasion.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilWishawWest LothianWhitburnLargs"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13056653.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_280417wind_23JPG.jpg","title":"mexican standoff power company giants","story":"NewsMexican standoff with power company giantsFurious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston14:39, 9 AUG 2018NewsPat Spence at Dochroyale Farm near Barrhill, is surrounded by wind farms (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA determined woman is refusing to hand over expensive wind farm monitoring equipment to an energy giant. Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron. Mhairi said: “Several months of planning by a small dedicated group of former pupils paid off spectacularly. “My only complaint is that the evening was over all too quickly.” Ben Glasgow added: “It was fantastic meeting up with so many people from our year group in the same room at the one time. “The dancefloor and bar did very brisk business.” DJ Steven James summed it up when he said: “It was slightly surreal looking out at a dance floor full of people that I hadn’t seen in such a long time. “By the end of the night, I felt like any barriers or negative preconceptions had been broken down. It’s amazing what a little progressive samba (and alcohol) can do.” Do you have a human interest story that you would like to feature in the Ayrshire Post then give us a call on 01292 294463Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonSchoolsUniversities and CollegesEducationAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-goes-extreme-with-town-centre-stunt-team","story":"EXPECT a few thrills and spills in Galashiels later this month as community leaders hit top gear.\nBusiness group BID Galashiels has organised a day of high-octane fun in and around the town centre on Saturday, August 25.\nAnd taking centre stage will be the dare-devil riders and skaters from Team Extreme.\nOn top of the professional stunt displays in Bank Street Gardens, there will be a seven-metre high climbing wall and a gladiator duel arena.\nA live music stage will make sure the thrilling spectacle has the perfect soundtrack.\nAnd for the energetic there will be Zumba and Spin Bike sessions with Live Borders.\nSeveral buskers have also been booked to make sure the day goes with a swing.\nCo-organiser Andrew Poole told the Border : \"We\u0027re incredibly excited to be bringing a professional stunt team to Galashiels.\n\"This is a real first.\n\"Team Extreme perform daredevil stunts throwing themselves sometimes twenty foot into the air on their skateboards and BMX bikes.\n\"This alone promises to be an exciting spectacle to watch.\n\"Add into that the other attractions on the day with the climbing wall, the gladiator duel arena, a live music stage and demonstrations of Zumba and Spin Bikes, the whole day is shaping up to be something very unique for Galashiels and a whole lot of fun for everyone.\n\"And importantly, everything on the day is free.\"\nThe event is the latest venture from BID Galashiels in an effort to create improved trading and business for the town.\nAndrew added: \"BID For Galashiels is a business community led organisation seeking to establish a Business Improvement District for Galashiels town centre.\n\"Part of that project is to demonstrate to local businesses how we can improve footfall and visitors to the town.\n\"This event is just one example of how we may be able to do that on a more regular basis, if the business owners vote positively for a BID to be established when they are balloted in November this year.\"\nThe fun day will run from 11am until 4pm and will be supported by a live outside broadcast from Radio Borders.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"last-blast-for-cheltenham-bound-selkirk-silver-band","story":"SELKIRK Silver Band is staging a special summer concert in the marquee at Haining House on Sunday, August 19.\nIt will be the band\u0026rsquos final public appearance before it heads to Cheltenham for next month\u0026rsquos UK national brass band championships.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a very exciting time for our members, said bandmaster Colin Kemp, \u0026ldquoand naturally the band wants to do everyone in Selkirk proud when it plays at the national finals in September.\n\u0026ldquoWe receive tremendous support from the local community throughout the year, and this month\u0026rsquos concert gives us the chance to show our appreciation for all the public\u0026rsquos help and encouragement.\nIn recent weeks band members have been busy raising funds to enable them to make the trip to Cheltenham.\nAs well running a pop-up shop and hosting a stall at last month\u0026rsquos farmers\u0026rsquo market, a commemorative brochure has been produced charting the band\u0026rsquos 121-year history.\nThe Haining concert will comprise a wide-ranging musical programme.

haunt of many writers down the centuries, including Rabbie Burns and Sir Walter Scott.\nAfter its closure in 2006, a community group was formed to fight plans to demolish sections and convert parts into housing.\nFollowing years of legal wrangles and funding applications the community purchased the historic building in 2013.\nIt was hoped that the Tweedsmuir Community Company would raise the required \u0026pound2 million to turn the Crook into a major tourist destination and hub for Tweedsmuir.\nBut the group has now changed course with a phased plan of development - starting with the conversion of the former steading building into a cafe.\nThe group also wants to create a bunkhouse in the former staff quarters during phase one.\nDuncan Davidson, chairman of Tweedsmuir Community Company, told us: \"Developments are afoot for the Crook Inn.\n\"Although we now have great designs, with planning permission, for complete renovation to create a Crook Inn Community Hub, the funding for the complete renovation has not been obtained.\n\"So we are developing a phased plan of redevelopment to convert the previous steading building into a caf\u0026eacute to serve the local community

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

Organisers posted the following message on Facebook: \"Firstly, we would like to thank the thousands who attended The Big Cheese Festival today and who congaed their way around the Main Stage Tent, creating that incredible Festival Atmosphere.  \"We would like to express our sympathy toward some of our amazing cheese and cheesey Street Food Traders who were traveling to the city from across the country, and who due to adverse weather conditions and impassable roads, were unfortunately forced to abort their journeys today.  \"Sadly due to this, a few compromises had to be made and we are disappointed that a larger variety of cheese wasn\u0026rsquot available.  \"Despite this, our cheese traders who were able to attend showed amazing dedication throughout the event, and did not fail to deliver, with food available right to the end.  \"We would like to offer everyone who purchased a ticket 50 per cent discount to next years event.  \"All feedback will be taken on board, please email info@thebigcheesefestival.\"  Did you attend the festival?

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.

The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

Kirsty, 41, who will be joined by her brother Steven Baron and sister-in-law Lorna, son Kieran and daughter Gemma, as well as other close family and friends, told the Courier she was so scared of heights that she could not even cross the Forth Road Bridge or climb North Berwick Law.  She added: \u0026ldquoEven when he had just months to live, he never wanted a fuss.  \u0026ldquoHe would had not have wanted what we are doing for him.  \u0026ldquoWhat he has gone through for 30 years, it is the least we can do to give back.

The Trust says 270 square miles of potential lynx habitat has been approved for a five-year trial involving a first release of six animals fitted with state-of-the-art GPS collars to monitor their movements.  If successful, it could lead to a wider reintroduction of the carnivorous cats in other parts of the UK, such as Argyll and Inverness-shire.  The trust has already identified an area of \u0026ldquosuitable lynx habitat covering over 10,000 square miles, as close as 30 miles to Glasgow, and consultation is already under way with several major landowners.  Supporters of the reintroduction of lynx say the native species would bring a range of benefits including helping to control deer through direct predation and by keeping deer herds moving through the forestry.  Analysis of similar projects in Europe suggests the animals could also help generate tens of millions of pounds in tourism.  Dr Paul O\u0026rsquoDonoghue, chief scientific adviser for the Lynx UK Trust, said: \u0026ldquoI think this (support from landowners) speaks volumes for the confidence in the trial reintroduction plan we\u0026rsquove laid out, and the potential it has for improving the local ecosystem and expanding the local tourist economy. Literally every landowner we have approached has given permission.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove got an incredible team of ecologists, four wildlife vets and highly experienced reintroduction specialists ready to start work, with a combined 300 years of experience between them.  \u0026ldquoThis will be an exceptionally rigorous, scientifically-led reintroduction trial using cutting edge technology to monitor these cats in stunning detail.  \u0026ldquoEverything is in place to deliver a project that will breathe life into Britain\u0026rsquos dying forest ecosystems.  Dr O\u0026rsquoDonoghue said that while the proposed release site is in Northumberland, it was a \u0026ldquocross-border project that could see lynx involved in the trial cross in to Scotland.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a cross-border site. Landowners on the Scottish and English sides have given access so lynx could be on Scottish soil. But we are also assessing Scottish sites in the Highlands and we see this trial as a precursor to rolling out a larger introduction in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThere is fantastic habitat as close as 30 miles from Glasgow, from Loch Lomond and the Trossachs into the West Highlands and the Great Glen. Lynx specialise on roe deer, of which Scotland has a massive overabundance \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a massive larder for the lynx."},{"url":null,"title":"document-suggests-snp-ministers-did-not-support-a-permanent-fracking-ban","story":"  Previously unseen papers state ministers do not \u0026ldquosupport the notion of a permanent ban because technology could improve and public attitudes may shift in the future.  The position stands in stark contrast to the later statements of senior SNP figures, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisting: \u0026ldquoFracking is being banned in Scotland, end of story.  Scottish Liberal Democrat energy spokesman Liam McArthur said it \u0026ldquodoes not say a lot for the way in which the Scottish Government has handled this policy that even at the 11th hour officials did not know whether ministers intended to permanently ban fracking or not.  He added: \"Moreover, there will be more than a few eyebrows raised in the communities who were promised that the threat of fracking had been removed, only to find out that the Government\u0027s promise potentially came with an asterisk attached.\"  Ministers introduced a moratorium on fracking, which involves pumping water and chemicals at high pressure into shale beds to release gas, in 2015.  Research found it could be worth an estimated \u0026pound1.2 billion to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy over the period to 2062, but critics argue it contributes to climate change and poses a public health risk.  Official documents released under Freedom of Information, written just days before energy minister Paul Wheelhouse outlined the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos final position on fracking in October, detail how ministers planned to announce their \u0026ldquocarefully considered judgement.  It said the Government does not back the development of a fracking industry in Scotland.  But it adds that Mr Wheelhouse should \u0026ldquoset out that the Scottish Government does not support the notion of a permanent ban as it is impossible to predict with any certainty what kind of clean energy technologies may be available in the decades to come, or future public attitudes.  Mr Wheelhouse made no mention of this in his statement to MSPs less than two weeks later. Instead, he said fracking had been \u0026ldquoeffectively banned, adding: \u0026ldquoThe decision that I am announcing means that fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland.  Challenged by Green MSP Mark Ruskell over whether this amounted to a permanent ban, Mr Wheelhouse said he was \u0026ldquotaken aback and suggested Mr Ruskell had not been listening.  He went on: \u0026ldquoI give reassurance \u0026ndash I tried to make it crystal clear in my statement \u0026ndash that there is, in effect, a ban on unconventional oil and gas activities in Scotland.  Earlier this year, a Scottish Government lawyer told a court it had not in fact banned fracking, insisting this was \"the language of a press statement\". It said the policymaking process is still ongoing, while ministers had simply announced \"a preferred position\".  Opponents accused the SNP of hedging its bets instead of implementing a real ban.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos environment spokesperson Claudia Beamish MSP said it was time for the SNP to \"respect the vote of the Scottish Parliament and show its clear commitment to a real ban of on-shore fracking in Scotland.  Mr Ruskell said: \"The change in tone between the Sir Humphrey-style hedge-your-bets briefing and Paul Wheelhouse\u0027s bullish statement shows that SNP ministers knew that they could sit on the fence no longer.\"  Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said there was \u0026ldquoclearly a lot of furious debate within the Government in the days leading up to the announcement of a ban.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted that fracking cannot take place in Scotland but we want the Scottish Government to go beyond the current ban in policy and enact a water-tight ban in law.  A Government spokesman said the \u0026ldquohandling plan was written by officials to provide recommendations, adding that Mr Wheelhouse \u0026ldquodid not agree with the specific recommendation referred to, and so did not include it in his statement.  He added: \u0026ldquoAs Mr Wheelhouse has repeatedly made clear in parliament, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos preferred position is not to support unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland. This position has been endorsed by MSPs of all parties and we are currently completing the Strategic Environmental Assessment of our preferred policy.  He said the Government had not been opposed to a permanent ban when the document was written, but did not explain how this continued to be included in the handling plan, weeks after ministers had met to discuss their stance."},{"url":null,"title":"homebase-to-close-80-more-stores-with-2000-jobs-lost","story":"  The DIY chain is next week expected to announce it will file for a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA), a controversial insolvency procedure used by struggling firms to shut under-performing stores.  Restructuring experts at Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal will carry out the CVA.  The Press Association first reported in June that Homebase was exploring further store closures through the procedure.  Homebase would have to secure the support of landlords to carry out a CVA.  But the property industry has expressed consternation at the procedure, which has been adopted by the likes of House of Fraser, Carpetright and Mothercare, saying it leaves them out-of-pocket.  The latest restructuring would come on top of a store closure programme the retailer has been carrying out since February.  A total of 17 Homebase stores have been shut this year and the business has also axed 303 jobs at its head office in Milton Keynes.  The store closures follow the sale of the business by its former Australian owner Wesfarmers to Hilco, a retail turnaround specialist, for \u0026pound1.  Homebase was bought by Wesfarmers for \u0026pound340 million in 2016.  Wesfarmers is known for its Bunnings chain in Australia, and attempted to import the home improvement brand to the UK by converting a host of Homebase stores into the Bunnings format.

The Polish-born French scientist, who became the first person to win two Nobel prizes - one for physics and one for chemistry - carried out important research into radioactivity, a term that she coined.  Her discoveries launched effective cures for cancer and helped in the development of X-rays in surgery.  The magazine asked experts in 10 different fields of human endeavour to each nominate 10 women they believe had the biggest impact, to create the list of 100 women for readers to choose from.  Curie\u0027s nominee, Patricia Fara, president of the British Society for the History of Science, said: \"She (Curie) was the first woman to win a Nobel prize in physics, first female professor at the University of Paris, and the first person - note the use of person there, not woman - to win a second Nobel prize.  \"The odds were always stacked against her. In Poland her patriotic family suffered under a Russian regime. In France she was regarded with suspicion as a foreigner - and of course, wherever she went, she was discriminated against as a woman.\"  The top 100 women were chosen for their achievements in areas including politics, science, sport, technology and literature, and saw the likes of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Dame Jenni Murray and historians Suzannah Lipscomb and Tom Holland among those putting together the shortlist.  In second place was Rosa Parks, an activist in the civil rights movement who protested against racial segregation in America, with leader of the British suffragette movement Pankhurst third.  As well as Curie, scientist Ada Lovelace, a computer programmer and mathematician, and crystallographer Rosalind Franklin made the top 20, in fourth and fifth places respectively.  The UK\u0027s first female Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, is in sixth place, while Diana, Princess of Wales, is at number 15.  Other names in the top 20 include writers Mary Wollstonecraft and Jane Austen, aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart and queens Victoria and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  BBC History Magazine deputy editor Charlotte Hodgman said: \"The poll has shone a light on some truly extraordinary women from history, many of whose achievements and talents were overlooked in their own lifetimes.  \"It is fitting that, in a year that has seen the 100th anniversary of the parliamentary Act that gave the vote to many British women, suffrage campaigners Emmeline Pankhurst and Josephine Butler have been voted into the top 20.  \"Whilst it is unsurprising to see queens such as Victoria and Eleanor of Aquitaine place high, it is refreshing to see some more unfamiliar names make the top 20, such as 19th-century philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts.

This week, the Russian synchronised swimming team blamed European Championship organisers for \u0026ldquopoisoning their ladies by adding too much chlorine, their swimmers having to compete \u0026ldquoblind.  This blaming was a little excessive. We Scots have been brought up to expect the upper levels of chlorination, (perhaps linked to our tradition of wee boys peeing in pools) and given the Russians actually won gold, we smiled knowing this was really retaliation for claims of Novichoking.  Students of Blame, however, should understand it can be a very useful device for soliciting empathy with the easily offended. Take the recent case of poet Anders Carlson-Wee. The white poet stood accused of cultural appropriation after he used black dialect to assume the voice of a female homeless person in American magazine, The Nation.  Now, what Blame students should note was this wasn\u0026rsquot an Ali G mickey take, this was a clever, thoughtful poem. Yet, it was easy for the blamers out there to force an apology from the magazine \u0026ndash and the writer himself, who each accepted their share of the blame. Triple blame achieved, all for transgressing (spurious) literary rules of good behaviour!  On a similar note, TV football pundit Ian Wright was blamed for cultural abuse, indeed his remarks reported to Ofcom after the former Gunner kicked at the ankles of Roy Keane\u0026rsquos Irish accent.  Now, Ofcom booted the complaints out of the park, so factor this in you blamers: Plato established a breakthrough in philosophy when he recognized that a linguistic sign is not the same thing as the signified. Many others came to accept this. So if you\u0026rsquore going to blame, pick easier targets. Pick the naive poets.  And once you come to understand the principles of blaming you may wish to consider a career in Law, where blame and personal development can work hand in hand. How does this work? Well, chartered psychologist Dr Angela Summerfield argued that because we are told we can all realise our dreams, that everything is within our grasp, when we learn this isn\u0026rsquot the case we come to the conclusion someone else is responsible. This could be the supermarket that sells you the hundred weight of crisps each week, which means you drive a mobility scooter, or the trainer company which forgot to attach a Tie Your Laces warning.  But don\u0026rsquot think to exploit smart, bold companies such as tree activity centre Go Ape, where you can Tarzan wonderfully with your children. This week, I learned organisers announce (to paraphase) that if you don\u0026rsquot connect your safety wires and you fall out of the tree you only have yourself to blame.    What you blamers out there should also factor in is that society seems to be imposing a statute of limitations on culpability. Dame Joan Collins has recently been mumping her 85-year-old (but still wonderfully shaped) gums about how she blames Warren Beatty for her missing out on an Oscar, having turned down Sons and Lovers in 1960.  Seems lover boy read the script and declared it to be \u0026ldquoAbsolute crap. But no one will blame anyone but Joanie who should have focused less on keeping frisky Beatty happy in bed and more on reading the Lawrence script attentively.  So be selective with your blaming: I\u0026rsquove tried blaming my tennis partner for being ten years younger, my ex-partner for not being a mind reader and my mother for not allowing me once to self-identify as The Batman. Each failed.  Be better blamers. If you wish to wear the crown of victimhood while casting around for those to implicate when things go wrong be smart about it. Look to Stevie G and Brendan and learn."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-seeks-to-shore-up-support-for-brexit-plan-among-tory-members","story":"  In the letter, sent to Tory members around the country, Mrs May acknowledged that last month\u0026rsquos Brexit White Paper had provoked \u0026ldquostrong feelings within the party.  But she insisted the proposals will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and set the UK on course for a \u0026ldquoproductive relationship with the remaining 27-member EU.  The letter, obtained by the ConservativeHome website, came as it emerged Mrs May is considering calling a top-level summit of Cabinet ministers early in September as part of the process of stepping up preparations for a possible \u0026ldquono-deal Brexit.  A slew of polls taken since the Cabinet summit in Chequers suggest unhappiness among large swathes of Tory members with Mrs May\u0026rsquos plans, with many preferring the no-deal option.  The PM has already attempted to allay concerns by inviting Conservative Association chairs to Downing Street and taking part in a conference call to discuss her plans.  In her letter, Mrs May recognised Tory concerns that her proposal for a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook with the EU on goods would stop the UK doing trade deals, but insisted \u0026ldquothis is not the case \u0026ndash and I would not be proposing it if it would.  Mrs May said talks with the EU had reached an \u0026ldquoimpasse, as both of the options on offer from Brussels \u0026ndash a standard free trade agreement or an EEA-style customs union \u0026ndash were \u0026ldquonot acceptable to me or to the United Kingdom.  The only way to break the deadlock was to \u0026ldquoget the EU to consider a third option, but they will only do that if we put forward proposals they find credible, she said.  She said getting a good deal would require \u0026ldquopragmatism and compromise from both sides.  But she insisted: \u0026ldquoThis vision for our future relationship with the EU will be very challenging for the EU \u0026ndash it is in no sense a concession to their demands.  \u0026ldquoI have been very clear that we are rejecting the two models they have put forward.\u0026nbspInstead, we are asking them to accept a bespoke model which meets the unique requirements of the United Kingdom.  The letter included messages of support for the Chequers plan from leading Leave-backing ministers Liam Fox, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom, as well as Chancellor Philip Hammond, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and party chairman Brandon Lewis."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-couple-offer-up-chance-to-win-luxury-six-bedroom-mansion-in-raffle","story":"  Dancers Hill House is a Georgian grade II listed property which is spread across more than 7,500 square foot of land just inside the M25 on the edge of north London.  It features six bedrooms and bathrooms, two lounges, a cinema room, a gym, a wine room, plus four acres of grounds, including a one and a half acre lake stocked with more than 2,000 fish.  Current owners Nigel and Melanie Walsh said a difficult property market, Brexit and Stamp Duty were hurdles to achieving a sale, so after nine months decided to adopt a creative approach.  Raffling off the property at \u0026pound13.50 a ticket after being inspired by similar competitions, Ms Walsh, 65, said it is a \u0026ldquogrand old house in lovely surroundings.  \u0026ldquoIt is time to move on, and it will be heart wrenching because this is a part of me\u0026hellip it has been a joy, we have had some great fun, she told the Press Association.  \u0026ldquoThere is just the two of us now \u0026ndash 7,500 square feet for two people \u0026ndash I mean it is funny, but it is crazy, we just don\u0026rsquot fill it anymore, she said.  \u0026ldquoI just got the feeling the house needed a new family, a new chapter. It has had a fantastic life.  The mother-of-three said when they bought the house in November 1992, it was in the \u0026ldquomost derelict state and required a lot of work before they moved in in July 1993.  Located just 14 miles from central London, it is within easy access of the capital\u0026rsquos major airports and has been recently renovated.  Ms Walsh said the property has appeared in the children\u0026rsquos television show ChuckleVision, and the 1999 adaptation of Great Expectations was also filmed there.  And in its former lifetime, it has also been used as a school and by the Army as Camp 33 to house Italian prisoners of war in the grounds.  The couple, who have been married for 42 years, have also held birthdays, family gatherings and even their son\u0026rsquos wedding at their property.  Asked who she would like to win the competition, Ms Walsh said: \u0026ldquoSomeone who will love it as much as we have.  \u0026ldquoThe people who are buying tickets and entering, I hope and I really mean this sincerely, that they are looking forward to winning Dancers Hill House.  \u0026ldquoI would like to see it go to a family who are going to cherish it and have as much fun as we have, and I hope we succeed.  Those entering the competition have to answer a question and then purchase their ticket.  The draw will be done at random, with the closing date for the competition on December 16 this year, or earlier if all the 600,000 tickets are sold.

Campbell died aged 45 on Coniston Water in the Lake District in January 1967 when the boat, travelling at more than 300mph, flipped into the air and disintegrated as he attempted to beat his own water speed record.  The restored hydroplane, which was recovered from the lake in 2001, has been undergoing tests at speed on Loch Fad on the Isle of Bute.  Asked if any world record speed attempts were planned, Mr Smith said: \u0026ldquoThat would be incredibly foolish.  \u0026ldquoYou saw what happened last time.

Nah.  He has spent 22 years restoring the boat, which has a new jet engine, along with volunteers but said the history was not at the forefront of his mind when she re-entered the water for the first time in more than half a century at the weekend.  He said: \u0026ldquoI just wanted to know that she wasn\u0026rsquot filling up with water and about to land on the bottom with her tail fin sticking above the surface.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos all I wanted to see.

For all it\u0026rsquos a wallowing, ponderous blue whale, when she says go she she\u0026rsquos a pretty violent machine.  \u0026ldquoShe looks pretty happy at that speed (150mph).  He hinted that the historic boat could become a regular visitor to the island, once this month\u0026rsquos test runs are over.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod come back and do it every year, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos like going on holiday with my mates and bringing a boat along for a laugh.  Spectators looked on as the hydroplane sped down the loch, following ear-splitting tests of the jet engine.  Lead pilot Ted Walsh endured the canopy bursting off at 150mph earlier in the week, which he wryly said was \u0026ldquopretty exciting.  He said archive footage has enabled the team to mirror Campbell\u0026rsquos progress.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos pretty interesting to see the boat is peforming in a pretty similar way to when Donald Campbell had it.  Campbell\u0026rsquos body, with his race suit still intact, was pulled from the Cumbria lake along with the wreckage in 2001.  Having broken eight world speed records on water and land in the 1950s and 1960s, Campbell was attempting to break his own water speed record of 276mph when he was killed."},{"url":null,"title":"bt-creating-more-than-1000-jobs-in-bid-to-provide-best-support-to-customers","story":"  The adviser roles will be created across BT\u0026rsquos consumer division in the UK and Ireland to fulfil its promise to provide the \u0026ldquobest and most personal support for customers.

Scottish Conservative MSP Peter Chapman this week challenged First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to tell farmers if she is in favour of the restrictions planned for the route and urged her to support overturning the ban.                                                    His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Thursday 9 Aug 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Thursday 9 Aug 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services by around 20% for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Thursday 9 Aug 2018 3:37

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Thursday 9 Aug 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Thursday 9 Aug 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Lord Advocate is being urged to step in after it emerged barely three convictions a year have been secured since the laws came into force with “limitations” in Scotland.             Campaigners claim images that are shared on social media for “group bonding” purposes or sold for financial gain, to a magazine or newspaper, can escape prosecution. \u2028One teaching union has warned the laws introduced in Scotland at start of the decade are not working and want mobile phones banned in schools because of the growing problem of pupils using them to take inappropriate photographs. Official figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show there have never been more than five prosecutions or convictions for upskirting, or covertly taking revealing photographs of victims.             Prosecutions have averaged 3.5 per year, with just 3.2 convictions, since 2011. Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur has written to the head of Scotland’s prosecution service, the Lord Advocate Lord Wolffe, raising concerns about the issue and questioning whether guidance to prosecutors remains “fit for purpose”.The prospect of the “very low numbers” being down to low instances of the offence is described as “counter-intuitive” by the Orkney MSP.He said: “There may be some procedural or legal obstacle preventing a more representative number of cases being brought forward and disposed of by the courts.“As you will appreciate, if such obstacles do exist the risk is that those who are victims of this unpleasant and distressing behaviour will be less willing to come forward with complaints in future.“I would welcome, therefore, your views on whether or not the law in this area, and guidance to prosecutors, remains fit for purpose.”            Figures obtained by the party through Parliamentary answers at Holyrood reveal there were just three prosecutions and three convictions in 2016/17, down from five in each category the previous year. In 2014/15, the figures dropped to just two prosecutions and one conviction.Upskirting was banned as a specific offence in Scotland in 2010 and similar measures are in the process of being introduced south of the Border when MPs return to Westminster later this year. The process was marked by controversy when Tory backbencher Sir Christopher Chote recently “talked out” a private members Bill that would have achieved the ban.The proposed English legislation will largely mirror the law in Scotland, but amendments have been proposed to tighten up the Bill after “limitations” were identified in the Scottish legislation.Clare McGlynn, a professor of law at Durham University who specialises in the regulation of pornography, image-based sexual abuse, including ‘revenge porn’, and sexual violence, has been working with MPs on the proposed changes.             She said the current law in Scotland only covers upskirting where it is perpetrated for motives of sexual gratification or causing distress.“That covers a lot of situations, but it doesn’t cover every single instance of upskirting,” she said.“So the debate in England has been, for example, about two main scenarios that might not be covered. One is where someone might take images for financial gain and say, sell them to a magazine.”\u2028She added: “The other major scenario that isn’t necessarily covered is that many of these sorts of images that are taken and are traded amongst groups of men who are trading them not to cause distress to the other person, and it’s not generally about sexual gratification either, it’s about their group bonding.“You see this with revenge porn images as well, often in closed Facebook groups, What’sApp groups. They’re taking and sharing the images amongst themselves. Sometimes they don’t care who the victim is. Often they don’t want the victim to know so you can’t say that they’re doing it to cause distress to the victim. If you have a law which says they have to prove that the perpetrator intended to cause distress to the victim, it doesn’t cover everything basically.”This becomes “another hurdle” which police and prosecutors have to overcome in trying to secure a conviction, according to the academic.             Prof McGlynn has already appeared before Westminster committees scrutinising the issue and provided recommendations and suggestions. Amendments to tighten up the English legislation in this area are expected to be brought forward when MPs consider the issue after the return of Parliament in September. Previous attempts to address the issue through amendments have been rejected at the opening committee stage when the government used its majority to vote them down.A Scottish Government spokesman said in addition to the specific “upskirting” ban north of the Border, a new offence was established last year of sharing “intimate images” without consent under the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act which was backed by a high profile media campaign to raise awareness.“Action can be taken and support is available to anyone  experiencing these types of crime,” the spokesman said."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"37 bruce crescent lerwick ze1 0pb ","story":"Offers over £167,000\n\n Externally: Off-road parking, a large front, side and back garden and an outside bin store.\nThe property is in move into condition.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 9 Aug 2018 3:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

That is a nonsense and the British government need to be called out on it. \n\"There is a big responsibility on Taoiseach Leo Vardakar and a responsibility on Michel Barnier and our partners in Europe to stand firm. \n\"The British government need to understand that they can\u0027t simply arrive in Ireland and set out a plan that is so destructive to our interests and expect that there won\u0027t be a mighty reaction to that,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27423  ","story":"Sinn Féin leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nSinn Féin leaders will meet the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier later today to make it clear that the issues of Ireland and the border need to resolved before the next EU summit in October. \nParty President Mary Lou McDonald TD and deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill MLA will meet Mr Barnier in Brussels later today at the headquarters of the EU Commission. \nAt today\u0027s meeting, the pair are expected to tell the EU negotiator that the backstop already agreed between the EU and the British government must be maintained and form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. \nThat backstop would see the north remain in the customs union and elements of the single market and would avoid the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nThe Sinn Féin leaders will also call on Michel Barnier to ensure the issues of the border and Ireland are resolved ahead of the next planned EU summit in October. \nOne way of doing this would be to hold a special EU summit in September to deal specifically with Irish issues, they are expected to tell he chief negotiator. \nToday\u0027s meeting will be the latest in a series of meetings between Sinn Féin and Michel Barnier both in Brussels and Ireland in recent months. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27424  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald TD along with Dáil Health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly TD and Assembly spokesperson on Mental Health Órlaithí Flynn MLA in Dublin today.\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The voices of women must be heard when it comes to healthcare.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

They want their elected representatives to engage in their public office duties with integrity and honesty. \n“What Ian Paisley did in accepting two lavish holidays to Sri Lanka and then lobbying on behalf of the Sri Lankan regime to thwart a UN investigation into serious human rights breaches and mass murder, isn\u0027t carrying out your duties with integrity.”\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f1.jpg","title":"65380  ","story":"    \nANTRIM boxer Conor Cooke believes he has the world in his hands after he left his first professional opponent sprawled at his feet following a spectacular second round KO.\nBut at 31 he knows he has to act fast.

It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"charity declines money raised at michael stone art exhibition","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We understand the sensitivities in Northern Ireland about an exhibition including his paintings.\n\n\"After careful consideration, we will be declining the money raised at the event.”\n\nFormer UDA man Michael Stone came to notoriety for his bloody gun and bomb attack on the Milltown Cemetery in March 1988, when he attacked the funerals of three IRA members, shooting and lobbing grenades into the crowd.\n\nThree people died during the attack, with Stone admitting to three other murders after being arrested.\n\nHe was released in 2000 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, but was imprisoned again in 2006 after attempting to kill Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness at Stormont, and is currently serving the remainder of the minimum 20-year jail term he was given in 1988.\n\nAs he is coming to his release date, he is eligible for 24 hours of unsupervised day release every four weeks in advance of this.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts east belfast roads remain closed after gas explosion","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"time drawing near for ireland border poll sinn feins mcdonald tells hunger strike event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

I persuaded him to stick with it and thankfully we got the visa, but this is just one example of the kind of crazy things people are being made to do in the name of coming to talk about their books.\n\n\nMorning all, and happy \n#BookLoversDay\n! 📕📗📘📙😍 With \n@edbookfest\n starting in just 2 days, today is perfect for getting in the mood for some literature love!

This year we’ve got round about 12 authors who have faced serious problems.\n\n“We’ve managed to overcome nearly all of them, we’ve got four outstanding, and I think we will resolve them with any luck.\n\n“But I think if this goes further we start to damage the reputation of the festivals, and we start to have authors wondering whether they can be bothered to go through that process of applying to come.”\n\nWhile he said senior government officials in both Edinburgh and London had been trying to help, along with ambassadors and members of the British Council, Mr Barley claimed: “I think the immigration laws which have been set in the last few years have had this consequence on artistic travelling.”\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has tweeting about the issue, saying: “It is really not acceptable that one of the world’s most renowned and respected book festivals @edbookfest is being undermined in this way. The UK government needs to get it sorted.”\n\nMr Barley said that most of those who have had difficulties this year have been authors from the Middle East and parts of Africa.\n\n\nWith only two days to go until \n#edbookfest\n begins, there\u0027s still tickets available for lots of events for all ages.

If that happens then we do seriously damage our chances of putting on a genuinely international festival.\n\n“We want to put Scottish writers and artists on the international stage, but we have to be able to create the international stage on which to celebrate the Scottish work too.”\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: “We welcome artists and musicians coming to the UK from non-EEA countries to perform.\n\n“In the year ending December 2017, 99% of non-settlement visa applications were processed within 15 days and the average processing time in 2017 was just under eight days.\n\n“Guidance on visa and entry clearance requirements is publicly available on gov.uk. Each case is assessed on its individual merits against the published immigration rules.”\n\nLast month, Peter Gabriel said it was “alarming” that a number of musicians were unable to perform at his world music festival Womad in Wiltshire after they faced visa issues.\n\nThe former Genesis frontman said many musicians “no longer want to come to the UK because of the difficulty, cost and delays with visas, along with the new fear that they will not be welcomed”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"employers are revealing the craziest things people have written on their cvs","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.
