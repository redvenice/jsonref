This could include simplifying tariffs and removing them completely on goods where Britain has no or limited domestic production, it said.\u0027It is vitally important that we now move away from the complex tariff schedule imposed on us by the European Union,\u0027 Truss said, adding that special arrangements would apply to goods entering Northern Ireland.The government also said it would also begin reviewing 43 EU trade remedy measures which were considered important to British industries, including anti-dumping duties of up to 36.1 per cent on imports of ceramic kitchen and tableware from China. "},{"url":null,"title":"Flashing spectator does best golfers PGA tournament Arizona","story":"Share this article The woman then does it again before the spectator adds: \u0027No wonder he misses this putt.\u0027  Fans were quick to react to the woman\u0027s antics, which ided opinions online.  Welshman James quipped: \u0027Are the playing for the Ry-DD-er Cup?\u0027Mint Crow joked: \u0027FORE-play.\u0027               he video - which has gone viral on social media, getting over 600,000 views and 15,000 likes - then pans around the golfers as they prepare to puttBut others were left unimpressed, with one Twitter user saying: \u0027No place on the golf course for that type of behavior.\u0027US golfer Webb Simpson, 34, won in a play-off on Sunday after he birdied the final two holes of regulation to force a playoff with Tony Finau, then won with a 10-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole.Two strokes ahead with two holes left, Finau missed an 18-foot birdie try in the playoff on the par-4 18th after driving left into the church pew bunkers.Simpson two-putted from the fringe on the short par-4 17th and made a 17-footer from the edge of the green on the 18th.

In the world of climate diplomacy, the maxim is “you host it, you own it”. In Copenhagen in 2009, the Danes owned a disastrous climate event that broke up in rancour. In Paris in 2015, the French owned the successful agreement.The 2020 UN climate change conference, known as COP26, which will be taking place in Glasgow in November, could be Copenhagen or Paris, or somewhere in between. Ownership and responsibility will firmly rest with the government. The events of the past few days have proved beyond doubt, however, that we cannot leave it to the government alone. We all need to take ownership of this event.In case you are not convinced, and feeling a bit inert, let me persuade you that this really matters: 2020 was the year nominated in the Paris agreement for when the world had to narrow the gap between its noble aspirations to limit global warming to 1.5C and its country-by-country commitments, which currently add up to, at best, 3C of warming. Given we only have a decade to decisively turn things around, we just cannot allow Glasgow to fail.This is a massive moment and the government has so far simply been unable to get to grips with the importance and the complexity of these negotiations, as illustrated by the fiasco over the appointment and sacking of Claire O’Neill, and the rather public – and so far fruitless – search for a president for COP26.However, it’s not just the government that needs to step up. Success or failure will in part depend on how much it is made to care about the issue. That depends on all of us. If the government thinks it can slink out of Glasgow without too much notice being taken, it may well decide other priorities are more important. We cannot let that happen.That means in practice, first, that the government must feel the pressure to act here at home. This summit is about persuading other countries to ratchet up their ambition. To succeed, we need to ratchet up ours and quickly.Britain has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 but currently our 2030 target does not reflect even that ambition. As we seek to persuade others to do more in the short term, we need a 2030 target of significantly greater ambition that puts us on track for net-zero by 2050.This more ambitious target must be accompanied by action in every sector, and a budget on 11 March that focuses on this issue, and includes a proper 10-year plan to decarbonise homes over the coming decade, while cutting bills and creating jobs.Third, we have to recognise that every lever of government must be part of making this agreement happen, particularly around how public and private finance supports or thwarts the transition. That includes mobilising public and private finance for developing countries, ending international government support for fossil fuel extraction and building on the appointment of Mark Carney as the COP special envoy to ensure proper regulation of financial and corporate institutions around climate risk.Fourth, over and above actions by national governments, Glasgow must power forward coalitions of states, cities, businesses and civil society around the path to net-zero, including the phasing out of coal, and petrol and diesel vehicles, estment from fossil fuels, and addressing deforestation.There are millions of people who care deeply about this issue in the UK and beyond. Extinction Rebellion and the pupil climate strikers have changed the terms of the debate over the past year. It’s up to all of us, including our brilliant NGOs, to ensure this moment sees the biggest mobilisation on the climate emergency in British history.You may wonder what the point of mobilisation is if the geopolitical forces are so badly aligned. The answer is there is no other option. The only way we will get change on this issue is showing government that there is a big political coalition that believes this really matters. Positive momentum from Glasgow is essential. We all need to step up. We all need to own it.Our future, and that of our children and grandchildren, is in the balance. Only by acting now can we prevent future disaster.• Ed Miliband is Labour MP for Doncaster North and a former climate change secretary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1c80ec4e1f53727a2547e9d2940d0c7ce9c231/134_259_3388_2032/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a82344adcc1ea291feeea9ee32414bc","title":"ireland election young voters sinn fein","story":"The surge of Sinn Féin in the polls has shocked the establishment – but not Ireland’s young peopleIn the run-up to the Irish general election being called on 14 January, public enthusiasm was somewhat lacking. In a post-Christmas slump, the country was half-heartedly preparing itself for a damp-squib campaign. Brexit was in the air, but not on the ground. The housing crisis rumbled on, the health service creaked under stress, but ’twas ever thus. And then, events.The murder and dismemberment of a teenager exposed Ireland’s drug-related underbelly, making organised crime an election issue early in the campaign. A man sleeping in a tent in Dublin was horribly injured by a canal-side “clean up” vehicle, illustrating the brutality of the homelessness crisis. And Fine Gael, the centre-right party whose outgoing government had a confidence-and-supply arrangement with its rival Fianna Fáil, continued to nurse its own self-inflicted wounds from a poorly proposed and deferred commemoration for the Royal Irish Constabulary.All of a sudden the campaign became dramatic, with the narrative of a country on the up spinning out of Fine Gael’s control. The party, led by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, presented its completed homework to the electorate – pointing to rising employment and claiming that it had the best “team” to manage Brexit negotiations – expecting gold stars. The electorate was unimpressed. Then the polls showed a trend that confounded the political and media establishment: after a very poor showing in the local and European elections last year, Sinn Féin was surging. Game on.Of course, the election alone isn’t driving change, but it has given life to the feeling that the public is far less satisfied with the outcome of Fine Gael’s period in government than the party expected. Take the central issue of housing, which encompasses astronomical rents, lengthy social housing waiting lists, and an increase in child homelessness and families in emergency accommodation, all alongside luxury construction projects. What was once a housing headache has become an unrelenting, national migraine.Ireland has the youngest population in Europe, and many of these people have become increasingly politicised in recent years, driven by their participation in the Irish social revolution, which responded to austerity with progressive, grassroots activism and culminated in referendums on marriage equality and legalising abortion. They also mostly refuse to inherit the tribal party affiliations of their parents and grandparents. The loudest applause in one of the leaders’ debates was reserved for Richard Boyd Barrett of the Solidarity-People Before Profit alliance. The electorate is not just looking for change, it’s looking to the left for it.Throughout the campaign, Fine Gael has attacked Sinn Féin as weak on crime, and Fianna Fáil as economically “reckless”, but its negative campaigning is falling flat, as the Irish electorate tends to demand civility from politicians and does not respond well to attack ads. In turn, Fianna Fáil has a tricky time attacking Fine Gael, having propped up its minority government for four years.While McDonald has successfully portrayed Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together as the malfunctioning status quo, contrasting it with Sinn Féin’s “new” approach, she faltered under pressure in this week’s leaders’ debate on RTE. McDonald excels at broad brushstrokes and connecting with people, but can be weak on figures and policy detail and, inevitably, the IRA’s past is brought to the fore by journalists and political rivals. The fact that she was included in the debate at all was news. So unexpected was the Sinn Féin surge that RTE had to roll back on its initial format of a head-to-head debate between Varadkar and the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin. However, Sinn Féin’s relative absence from the media spotlight, with fewer policy launches and media events (a joke among journalists was that McDonald won an early debate between Varadkar and Martin despite not even being there) has allowed a significant section of the electorate to see it as a radical change-maker, whether it is or not.Will the surge dissipate on election day? Spooked by losing seats in the 2019 local elections, Sinn Féin isn’t running enough candidates to capitalise on its current nationwide popularity. The most likely outcome is some version of a Fianna Fáil coalition, perhaps with Fine Gael – a potentially muted conclusion to a dramatic campaign. A single party, or a combination of parties and independents, requires 80 seats to form a majority or a coalition. A combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael seats would probably exceed that, whereas even if every Sinn Féin candidate were elected – which is highly unlikely – they would still only number 42.Sinn Féin may privately welcome a strong period in opposition, especially if there’s an unpopular centrist government in power. Disgruntled public sentiment will not simply evaporate, the generational cleavage is very real and demands for change are louder than any party expected. Whatever happens on Saturday, the boundaries of Irish politics are being redrawn.• Una Mullally is a columnist for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4b244b2ee8c018003f705fc28cd7cf9f476705c/0_142_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1f61e3433977ca524c98589d926b7ec","title":"landlubber feels call of sea adrian chiles","story":"Many of our coastal communities are faring just fine. The last thing they need is the pity of a city-dweller like meIf you are from Birmingham, the sea will always have a special magic. To this day, I am slack-jawed in wonder at every first sight of it. When I went to university in London I was disarmed to make the acquaintance of people who lived by the sea all year round. I have never lost my sense of wonder about these people either. For the last few months it has been my job – as much as I can ever call it work and keep a straight face – to meet the people of our coast.

They should embrace that messageThe outcome of the Senate “trial” of impeached president Donald Trump was known from the start, but the whole charade was still yet another shock to the US democratic system. Not the expected “acquittal”, but the refusal to hear witnesses, the autocratic argumentation used by his lawyers (in short, whatever the Great Leader deems in His interest, is in the country’s interest), the speed of the “trial”, and particularly the “he did it, but we don’t care” arguments from Republican members of Congress.I have previously argued that the Democrats were damned if they did (impeach him), damned if they didn’t. In the end, they did the right thing, morally and politically, even if impeachment might not have been the best strategic move. Democrats had to make it clear that Trump’s actions constituted abuse of power – and they did. Unfortunately, a minority of Americans, who hold a majority of power, don’t care. So, where does this leave the Democrats now?Many Democrats will feel relieved, even if they won’t say it out loud, freed from focusing almost exclusively on a no-win issue. Very soon the senators involved in the Democratic primary will be in New Hampshire, desperately trying to make up for the lost campaign time they were forced to spend in Washington. But are they truly liberated? The impeachment process might be over, but is the impeachment issue over too?A study of 150,000 voters found that impeaching Trump was in the top four issues for the likely voters of all five Democratic frontrunners. In fact, it was the top issue for Biden voters and the number two issue for Klobuchar and Sanders voters. The latter is particularly surprising, given that Sanders has been the most open about his frustration about impeachment, seeing it as a distraction from his campaign. He will no doubt be keen to return to the “real issues”. Will his supporters?Given the priority of the issue for Democratic supporters across the spectrum, moving on might be more complex than Sanders hopes. Sure, the end of the impeachment process means that politics returns to “normal” – whatever that means in the Trump era – and space for other issues opens up again. Moreover, senators can get back to the dinners and state fairs that the bizarre primary process has transformed into the “real America”. (They will have photo ops with “real Americans”, at least the ones not too busy being interviewed by the New York Times or NPR.)But they will have to integrate the impeachment issue one way or another into their campaign. Simply moving on not only ignores an issue many Democratic voters deeply care about, but also leaves unanswered an important question: what went wrong? And, perhaps more importantly, what does this mean for US democracy and the 2020 elections?The Democratic candidates have to find a way to integrate the impeachment issue into a broader narrative that satisfies both Democrats frustrated by Trump’s acquittal and independents frustrated with the focus on impeachment over the past months. The whole sordid affair once again proved that Trump controls the Republican party and that almost no politically relevant Republican is willing to stand up to him, not even to protect the democratic system. But if this is true, then the political struggle is not only against Trump, but against the Republican party in general, and particularly those in Congress. Which means that the presidential election is only one of the many political battles of November 2020 that Democrats should focus on.Rather than downplay their defeat, Democrats should openly embrace it. The truth is that many Democrats, including several presidential candidates, supported the impeachment process more or less reluctantly. They were forced to do so by Trump’s blatant abuse of power. Even though they knew impeachment was a political liability, they put country over party – unlike the Republicans.The Democrats’ message ought to be: impeachment was not a bad strategic choice for the party but a calculated risk for the sake of the country. If they can stick to this message, perhaps the Republicans might have won the impeachment process, but the Democrats will win the impeachment issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfd2a810c9391537c311593b99baa816244d728f/0_248_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2715a07eef00fd1a645fa734d2cfdaa","title":"london loo codes public toilets","story":"We started the @LDNLooCodes account thinking of it as the simplest kind of direct action: distributing codes on social media (and eventually in print for those without smartphones) to help people in the capital access locked toilets. Our first tweet explained that we would be sharing the codes for loos in various cafes around London as we got them. But the idea – an evolution from personal lists of bathroom codes we kept in our notebooks during our studies – quickly spread further than we could have hoped.The account gained thousands of followers. We received scores of code submissions from all over London, and were inundated with messages of support. Fledgling accounts have sprung up in cities across the UK, from Cardiff to Edinburgh. Blown away, we worked quickly to consolidate the codes (along with the address, nearest tube stop, and the accessibility and gender-neutrality information of the loo in question) into an open-access spreadsheet. With so much interest, and astonishingly little criticism, we kept asking ourselves: how on earth are we the first people to have done this?Two weeks on, it’s clear that our small operation has tapped into an issue in desperate need of being addressed. Britain’s legacy of public loos is a product of the “gas and water socialism” of the late 19th century, which saw thousands of ornate public bathrooms built into streets across the country. In 2020, the landscape is different. The incentives now are for cash-strapped councils to sell off or close – rather than restore, retrofit and reopen – these loos, a problem exacerbated by austerity.According to the BBC, 1,782 public conveniences closed across the UK between 2006 and 2016. Most of these were chained and boarded up, due largely to the cost of keeping them open, while others have been sold off to be turned into swanky bars and other private businesses. Consequently, most functioning toilets are run, maintained and locked by businesses with no legal requirement to open them to people who aren’t customers.The problem is everybody needs to use them, and many more urgently than others. Take those with health conditions, such as the 300,000 or so Britons living with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, for whom the availability of a bathroom is a constant consideration. People with such conditions routinely fear venturing out, and meticulously plan their journeys along the routes of known public bathrooms (a limitation often referred to as a “loo leash”).Consider older people, for whom moving around cities designed for those who are able-bodied is a formidable enough task before even considering bathroom access. Then there are those caring for children or those who are menstruating. A lack of bathrooms is a scourge of daily life. For many rough sleepers, who will have a hard time entering a cafe or bookshop let alone obtaining a code, it is easier to resort to the corners of streets we all use, and risk being fined.Councils are not currently legally responsible for providing public loos. It is therefore easy for them to abdicate accountability, and cafe chains and others can pick up much of the slack. But this a cop-out. Given that chains such as Pret, Costa and Waterstones control the only currently viable network of loos, the first step must be for them to respond to our campaign not by doubling down on updating their codes (as some branches appear to have done so far), but by removing them altogether. Alongside this, government policy must change to ensure the statutory inclusion of public toilets in transport and city planning (the plans for Healthy High Streets, rolled out by Transport for London and some London boroughs this month, contain no mention of toilets). This is not a radical proposal like clean drinking water, a wide and functioning network of accessible public toilets is vital to modern society. If publishing access codes brings us closer to that, then so be it.• Merlin Jobst is a freelance writer and researcher.

But the poisoning of a mother and three cubs has forced the issue into the openAs a child living in the Vagheri hills at the foot of the Western Ghats, Rajendra Kerkar would often hear the majestic roar of tigers echo across the mountains. It was never greeted with fear by the villagers in this remote corner of northern Goa the name Vagheri translates as “home of the tigers” and coexistence with India’s national animal was part of their way of life.Yet according to state authorities, these tigers do not exist or if they do, they are just passing through. Unlike other states in India, where the presence of tigers has been celebrated, embraced and in many cases exploited for tourism, Goa’s tigers have instead been subjected to a strange charade, whereby their existence has repeatedly been denied or covered up by those in government.So when a mother and her three cubs were found dead in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in the Sattari region of Goa last month, allegedly poisoned by disgruntled locals, the deaths – one of the biggest losses to India’s tiger population in years – brought an uncomfortable issue to the surface.“I have spent my whole life tracking tigers, so I know they are living in Goa,” says Kerkar, a well-known environmental activist in the state. “But even with all these years of proof, still the government have failed to acknowledge tigers in Goa. They have looked away to serve their economic interests, to keep on cutting down the forests for mines and tourism until there will be nothing left for the tigers.”Tigers have been touted by India as one of its great environmental success stories, with the most recent figures showing the population now at close to 3,000, a third higher than four years ago. Although there has been some dispute over the numbers, prime minister Narendra Modi presented the most recent tiger census with the claim that India was “now one of the biggest and most secure habitats of the tiger”.The currently unprotected area of the Western Ghats in Goa forms a crucial part of the tiger corridor running from Maharashtra to Karnataka, which activists and the WWF have described as “the best and only hope for the continued survival of the tigers of India”.But in a state heavily dependent on tourism, real estate and, until recently, iron ore mining, protecting the tiger’s forest habitat has been portrayed as a threat to industry and development. “If you are using wildlife to block the economy, you create enemies of wildlife,” said Goa’s chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, in 2013.Despite tigers first being officially recorded in Goa in 2002, and the tiger census and local rangers putting the current population in Goa between five and 10, there is still no tiger reserve in the state and therefore no official protection.“The Goa state government has been trying to suppress the presence of tigers for at least the past 40 years for the simple reason of mining and real estate,” says activist Abhijit Prabhudesai.One issue driving the resistance is that creating a tiger reserve would mean establishing a buffer zone around the protected forest. This no-build area would encroach on land already occupied by extractive industries or owned by powerful landlords. While the supreme court banned mining in Goa in 2018, many expect it to eventually resume, but a tiger reserve would make that less likely. Some Goa government figures have business interests linked to mining.A shroud of secrecy surrounds the tigers in this part of northern Goa, where locals will deny ever having seen one, or scurry away whenever tigers are mentioned. Resistance to a tiger reserve is strong. “No tigers here,” says one woman interviewed by the , despite the fact that according to local reports the night before her cow had been killed by a tiger.“It is government officials and local community leaders who have been feeding the fear of tiger reserves to locals to serve their own agenda, so they can keep tearing up the land for hotels and mines,” Prabhudesai adds. “They have been telling them that if you accept the presence of the tigers then you will be relocated and you will be thrown out from your villages. Fear has been planted in the minds of the people.”After the four tiger deaths, denials from the state government once again emerged. “Tigers found in the wild in Sattari are basically transitory tigers, coming from Karnataka,” said Vishwajit Rane, Goa’s health minister, who represents the district where the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is located. “I will not allow the tiger reserve in Sattari,” he added. “Environmentalists don’t run Sattari, people there do. No one has the right to declare Sattari a tiger reserve and we will not allow it.”Rane’s comments are the latest in a long line of official flip-flopping between acceptance and denial on tigers since Mhadei was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1999. But as the killings demonstrated, it has led to a failure to deal with an increasingly vexed relationship between humans and tigers in Goa.This resentment appears to have led to the deaths of the four tigers in January, when people living on the fringes of the sanctuary are alleged to have taken matters into their own hands after a tiger killed livestock in late December. According to the forest department, a poisoned water buffalo carcass was put out as bait and eaten by the tiger and her cubs.The five accused men, who asked not to be identified, denied killing the tigers and said their confessions were beaten out of them while in custody, where they were also made to sign documents they could not read as they are illiterate. This was denied by the forest department. But the villagers said they had suffered the consequences of tiger attack for years, and had been given no assistance by the forest department, the government body responsible for the Mhadei sanctuary.“Once a year we lose a cow or a buffalo in an attack and so it is very scary and frustrating for us because we don’t know what to do,” says one of the men. “The forest department give us no help, they leave us on our own. All they do when they come here is harass us and pressure us.”It was a similar story in the nearby village of Derode, where a water buffalo had been killed the night before. No one would discuss the attack except for 65-year-old Ganesh Cholekar, who defiantly says he has “no reason to be scared and not to speak the truth”. “There are local leaders and officials that tell us when our cattle are attacked by tigers, we need to not talk about it and if anyone asks, say that we have never seen a tiger in the vicinity,” says Cholekar. “Over the past five years, more attacks have been happening because they come down to the village for water.”He adds: “We are helpless against them and we don’t get compensation and so in some people’s mind they do think about killing the tigers, just to make it stop.”Crucially, the issue of the settlement rights of 31 villagers living inside or on the edge of the Mhadei sanctuary has yet to be resolved. If environmental protections were increased and the sanctuary declared a tiger reserve, the villagers would have to leave, and would be entitled to compensation. According to Santosh Kumar, chief wildlife warden for the forest department, these land rights remain the greatest obstacle to declaring a tiger reserve. Kumar says Goa’s chief minister, Pramod Sawant, has vowed to make it a priority.“Of course there are tigers living in Goa’s wildlife sanctuaries,” says Kumar. “The issue has been delayed for over 20 years but now we have faced the deaths of these four tigers the government is ready to act.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0762fd43b844d92de49c7c116864573f02fc0989/47_0_2832_1700/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f99a0e4cc1b1d1c6e9b89235a9202649","title":"modern ark designs for the new climate reality in pictures","story":"Floating villages and an ‘amphibious house’ are among some of the solutions as architecture adapts to the growing problem of urban flooding• Sea Change: flood resilient architecture for the 21st century is at the Roca London Gallery, 1 February–16 May 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a8104e4d53c462a104d8e3b3e6dfc052762aaf3/205_324_3556_2133/master/3556.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a7613cddc6277f1d0d39c9ff4b040f4","title":"a streetcar named desire review vivien leigh marlon brando elia kazan","story":"The toxic chemistry between Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando isn’t all about sex in the 1951 adaptation of Tennessee Williams’ play, now rereleasedAt the beginning of this drama, bewildered and highly-strung Blanche DuBois famously arrives in New Orleans off the train, intending to stay with her sister Stella and rough-hewn brother-in-law Stanley Kowalski. She tells a kindly stranger she is supposed to get the streetcar named “Desire” – so called because it is headed for the city’s Desire Street. (There is also Pleasure Street and Piety Street.) She must then change on to a streetcar named “Cemeteries” (in the direction of the St Louis and Lafayette burial grounds) and finally alight at Elysian Fields Avenue, where Stella and Stanley live.The metaphorical progression of desire, death and heaven is obvious, but heaven is not where Blanche is to wind up. This 1951 movie, adapted by Tennessee Williams from his own stage play and directed by Elia Kazan, is now rereleased in UK cinemas as part of a Kazan season at London’s BFI Southbank.It is a film whose central performance from Vivien Leigh takes some getting used to, and I think maybe I still haven’t. There is a crazed Miss Havisham-type intensity to it and some real theatrical fireworks, but I can never see this film without thinking that, from the outset, Leigh’s extravagantly mannered style goes too far, too fast into the poignant paranoid twilight – and leaves her addressing the audience on a single note.Kim Hunter, playing her sister Stella, is somehow a more credible human being, especially in showing the complex sensuality of her relationship with Stanley. But perhaps Blanche has to be soignée and brittle and absurdly self-deluding in order for her presence to work alongside the extraordinary Marlon Brando as the uncouth Stanley: brutal, threatening, swaggering, always finding an excuse to take his shirt off in front of her.But it isn’t clear why she has had to quit her schoolteacher’s job back in her home town, and there are worrying rumours about her entertaining guests there in a certain local hotel. When a delicate young boy comes around collecting money, Blanche insists on kissing him on the lips: the nearest she comes to actual desire in the whole picture, but it is more innocent than predatory.What is the nature of this toxic chemistry between Stanley and Blanche? It is not all about sex: much of it is about class. Stanley resents Blanche’s condescension and snobbery and is also suspicious of her furs and jewels, and the way she has apparently abandoned her parents’ handsome family home. In their minds, it’s as legendary a place as Tara in Gone With the Wind, a film that featured Leigh at the age Blanche believes she still is now. But the house is now apparently worthless, hopelessly mortgaged for debts, perhaps due to Blanche’s mismanagement – so Stanley’s share of that supposed inheritance is zero. Is there some brutal part of Stanley that thinks maybe he is entitled to sex from Blanche in lieu of this legacy?Maybe. But that doesn’t quite explain how simmeringly resentful and conflicted Stanley is around Blanche. My own view is that Williams has ventriloquised and heterosexualised his own sensibilities into Blanche: this is a fictional variant of a gay man doing the tense bickering and bantering with a half-naked Stanley and, perhaps, delicately kissing a young boy on the lips. Only in this context can you understand Stanley’s puzzled unease and contempt.Brando tends to upstage and upend the whole picture in his way, and Karl Malden, though excellent as Blanche’s diffident suitor Mitch – a man whose feelings are trifled with by her – is obviously in Brando’s shade. Having said that, Mitch does get to say exactly what is on his mind in a way that Stanley perhaps doesn’t.There is a dark genius in the final scene when poor Blanche is getting ready, expecting the gentleman caller and former beau who is going to take her away on a Caribbean cruise. For the first few minutes, we don’t understand quite why the mood is so tense and subdued and why Stella is so wretched. Kazan controls this sequence tremendously. And the famous kindness for which Blanche is so pathetically grateful: that is merely the world’s shrugging indifference or cruelty that Blanche, self-deluding to the last, tries to transmute into compassion.• A Streetcar Named Desire is rereleased in the UK on 7 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fbd0623f60962bb181e9253c0c7de9d4bf68fdc/0_230_2798_1677/master/2798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b7e02f57f0410656d3823d4e6fc64fd","title":"kirk douglas a life in pictures","story":"Kirk Douglas, the last great star of Hollywood’s golden age, once said he had ‘made a career playing sons of bitches’, a career that began in 1946 with the film The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.

Most energy snacks use the dates to bind the other ingredients together. They are rich, caramelly and chewy, but they can also be a bit grainy and sticky. These energy balls are smooth and glossy due to the emulsifying effect of the melted dark chocolate.

Top chefs from Yotam Ottolenghi to Tom Kerridge reveal what they would buy for under a fiverIt is cold. It is dark. It is winter. And post-Christmas, we all feel skint. How do you lift spirits and put some sizzle in your cooking without spending much? We asked some of Britain’s best chefs: if you had a fiver or less to spend – what would you buy??The Dutch East India company listed soy sauce in 1737. It has a long history in Europe, but I don’t think British people understand how powerful it is. It’s liquid umami for a couple of quid and, used judiciously, it’s amazing in bolognese, chilli, stews and marinades. If you’re frying mushrooms and want a real flavour boost, bung a tablespoon in and reduce it down. Hat tip on this to Tara Wigley, who I write with. Buy as many green and red chillies as you can, finely slice and salt them (one tablespoon per 250g). Refrigerate in a sealed container for three days, then blitz with cider vinegar (3 tbsp) and lemon juice (1 tbsp). In a new container, seal the paste with olive oil and keep in the fridge. Spoon over and into anything savoury to ramp up its flavour.The Too Good to Go app helps fight food waste. Customers buy a magic bag from a listed cafe or restaurant – maybe a chain like Yo! Sushi or an indie like us – filled with food that would have been binned. You can’t be too fussy. You might get meat, veg or a bag of cakes, and sometimes the bags are cancelled and refunded if places get busy. But you do get excellent deals. Our bags cost £3 for £9- or £10-worth of food. If you need inspiration for the contents, you can pick up some brilliant cookbooks second-hand for under a fiver. For example, Merry White’s Cooking for Crowds, Claudia Roden’s A New Book of Middle Eastern Food or Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s reliable River Cottage Veg Every Day.I was born in Manila, and Filipino cooking is a real combination of sweet and sour, often in the form of vinegar-based dipping sauces. At Bong Bong we use 7 Up (some Filipinos think it should be Sprite) in a sweet 24-hour pork-rib marinade. I presume this came from Americans in the Philippines during the second world war, who used Coke in BBQ marinades and that kind of thing. Ours is half-and-half 7 Up and soy sauce, plus garlic, ginger, chilli, sugar and fresh lemongrass, which creates good caramelisation and sweet, citrusy, fragrant ribs.I used expensive Japanese knives for years before an Aussie chef put me on to the Thai-brand Kiwi knives. They’re my go-to knives for daily prep – ultra-sharp, super-lightweight and with a very thin blade you can quickly put an edge on. You can pick them up for about £5.Buy 200g, ide into 10 cubes and freeze them inidually. As needed, stir one into a casserole, chilli, puy lentils or even a curry to give it a massive enhancement. At 40p a pop, it’s an incredibly cost-effective way to drive flavour into dishes.A squeeze of lemon will transform almost any food you can think of you need that balance of acidic tartness, even in a bolognese. A lemon is what, 30p? That’s the kind of cooking that real chefs do. You’ll notice the difference.I’m salt-obsessed, and this salt takes things to the next level. I add it to salads, roasted veg and cooked grains. Sprinkled over cauliflower roasted in curry powder, its smokiness makes the soft, charred cauliflower almost meaty-tasting. I’m French and both my grandmas use parsley all the time. It’s about 70p a bunch on Kirkgate Market and you can do amazing stuff with it. We use a lot of parsley sauce made with garlic, vinegar, mustard, oil, salt and pepper. You can put this vibrant green sauce on eggs, sandwiches, pasta or with fish. It keeps for five days in the fridge. I use this to jazz up pasta sauces. It’s pretty punchy. Blend a tin of chopped tomatoes with one heaped tablespoon of harissa until smooth, cook for 30 minutes on a medium heat, season with salt, add pasta, parsley and feta and you’ve got a delicious dinner.If you have a decent carbon-steel wok, ditch that wooden spoon and get a proper 14in plastic-handled stainless steel wok spatula, also known as a wok chuan or turner. Chinese supermarkets have them for about a fiver and because this shovel-like utensil is designed to fit the wok’s curves, it’s like having your own hand in there. It’s much easier to move things around and char them properly. I stock up on every type of lentil and pulse I can to make dhal. LSD, life-saving dhal, as the great Madhur Jaffrey calls it. I never get bored of it. Hodmedods’ British lentils and pulses have become a cheap, reliable store-cupboard essential for me. I love to fry onion, garlic and dried mint, then braise the lentils with a punctured dried Iranian lime and veg stock. Add tons of parsley and dill at the end. It’s such a nourishing, flavourful meal with bread or rice.My secret weapon. A salty, savoury sauce made from chillies and fermented soy beans, which I use instead of salt in a lot of food. I put it on everything. It tastes delicious stirred into cooked rice. I would recommend this to any home cook. After cutting freshly made gnocchi, you roll it softly across the board to score it, not just to make it pretty but also to create a better surface area for your pasta sauce to coat. This little board can also be used for different pastas as such garganelli and conchiglie.Marmite is essential in my cooking. Controversially, perhaps, I always add a teaspoon to the chicken broth in which I cook my goat meatballs. A dollop of this pungent, salty sauce in any meat or veggie dish, stock or stew adds a flavoursome punch.I buy my vegetables at Church Street Market, near Edgware Road, London. The traders sell bowls of veg for £1. You might get five aubergines in one or a couple of white cabbages, which I use to make sauerkraut in the winter. For £5 you can get a grade-A French black-legged chicken. On Fridays, there is a chap who sells squabs for £2.50. It’s first class.Most non-stick pans last three months if you’re lucky and might cost £35. We buy 50 Ikea ones at a time for £2.75 each. The non-stick only lasts weeks in a professional kitchen, but then we just use them as normal pans until they die. I’ve been doing this over 10 years. They used to be 79p!Just a teaspoon of Gentleman’s Relish can elevate a simple tomato sauce into something really special.

As for the problems, there are a lot. “It’s not normal to take over at a team that’s top,” Setién said when he arrived on 13 January but nor is it normal for so many things to happen so fast. And the scale of the latest problem – his captain and best player publicly calling out the sporting director – is yet to be fully gauged. The club’s president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, spoke to Eric Abidal and Lionel Messi on Wednesday, desperate to restore calm. After a long meeting, the decision was made to stick with Abidal.The day before Setién turned up, it was confirmed Luis Suárez needed an operation and would be out for three or four months. They sold two strikers, Carles Pérez and Abel Ruiz, to raise funds and make space for another but, having briefed that it was all tied up, they failed to sign one. Carles Aleñá had gone too, and Jean-Clair Todibo, and Moussa Wagué, but still they had not raised enough. No matter, Setién said, Ousmane Dembélé would be the “signing”: he was on his way back to full fitness and would be “flying”. Then the news broke that Dembélé had torn a tendon in his thigh and would miss the rest of the season.The squad are weaker, not stronger, than when Setién arrived this is not what he was sold. On Wednesday morning only 16 first‑team players were named to travel to face Athletic in Bilbao – and that is everyone they have got. Samuel Umtiti would have to make his own way there: he was wanted in court in the morning, accused of doing almost £170,000 worth of damage to a flat he was renting. At the weekend, Ivan Rakitic admitted he was unhappy at how Barcelona had tried to force him out. Arturo Vidal’s agents had already begun legal proceedings over a disputed bonus.And then, as if all that was not enough, on Tuesday night Abidal gave an interview to Sport. In it, he said he was optimistic Messi would sign a new deal and that Barça’s star player was happy at Camp Nou. But what he said in response to that question was eclipsed by what he said in response to others, which in turn changed the veracity of that statement.Abidal had suggested some of Barcelona’s players had been “unsatisfied” with the former manager Ernesto Valverde – responsible for this sacking, in other words. He also said they did not “work much”. For Messi, long assumed to wield power, the heaviest of dressing‑room heavyweights and invariably burdened with responsibility, the accusation was intolerable. It took less than 90 minutes from the first brief advance of the interview going live for Messi to react: it was public and unequivocal, the ision and resentment exposed.On Messi’s Instagram account a red circle was drawn around the quote: “Lots of players were not satisfied and nor did they work much.” Below it, Messi demanded Abidal take responsibility for his actions, accusing him of “dirtying” the players and challenging the sporting director to name names. Messi takes more responsibility than he should he was not going to take this one, too. Many thought he was right and even those who thought Abidal might be did not consider it a good idea to say so. The damage was done and it awoke the greatest fear: Messi leaving.Messi has a clause in his contract that allows him to leave at the end of the season – and for free. As Abidal admitted, all he has to do is communicate that in May. The 32-year-old has said repeatedly he wants to finish his career at Barcelona but has also said he wants to compete and over the past five years he has felt increasingly like Barça do not. Nor does he have long left: at December’s Ballon d’Or presentation for the first time he raised the question of retirement. There is a growing feeling his final years are being wasted and Messi is not immune to that feeling.Messi has not won the European Cup for five years. He has watched Barcelona fail to build around him – whether he is part of that problem is a broader, more complex question – and seen a generation slip into retirement and not be replaced. He has seen a lack of direction and certainty, four directors of sport and endless advisers under this regime. He has seen the president become vice-president as well and the team become weaker, despite spending €1,000m since the departure of Neymar. And now this. No wonder he snapped.Messi’s response does not come in isolation: there have been small signs of distrust everywhere, glimpses of the isions opening up, and not just from him. This is the player who stalled on posing for a photo with the president after his last contract renewal, as if reluctant to legitimise him the player who said the director Javier Faus, who had suggested there was no reason why Messi should get a new contract every year, “doesn’t know anything about football” who saw his friend Dani Alves suggest that, by leaving, he had delivered a deserved and “classy blow” to the board.Since Neymar left there has been a sense of the club reaching for something that has gone, desperate for a solution that never arrives. The only solution, it often felt, was Messi. He was a shield behind which many hid, a reason for complacency, conditioning everything. He wanted to share that burden, have a team constructed around him. Instead, he must have wondered what else he had to do, why it always seemed to come down to him. In the last few weeks even his best friend Suárez has been absent, with Messi cutting an even lonelier figure.This summer Messi watched his other great friend Neymar and Barcelona end up in court, even while they spent the summer supposedly courting each other. And then said: “I don’t know if the club did everything they could to sign him.” Messi wanted Neymar but he didn’t get that wish, however much they say he runs the place. The irony of course is that if the response is to sack Abidal, which it might be if only because the alternative is so awful, another short-term fix, it would reinforce the idea Messi is all powerful. Another fire to put out, sparked by Abidal’s hint that player power was too great.There is no player like Messi his reaction, at least, illustrates he felt the finger pointing at him and was not prepared to let it go. He asked for names: maybe some were not happy, maybe some were not working but do not look at me. And do not hide behind me, either. He has enough responsibility already to take on other people’s errors as his own, to be made a participant of the problems piling up since Setién arrived and well beyond that, failure delivered to his doorstep again. Above all, to be blamed for this mess.The AS journalist Santi Giménez on Wednesday offered a simple response to the accusation Messi runs Barcelona: if only."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c61a34704bb3862439fe890aae8a96bbee10f056/459_0_2613_1568/master/2613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e8effd304229305c95098a4f488204","title":"arsenal vivianne miedema a top mens player gay coming out would help others","story":"The Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema believes it may take an elite men’s player to come out as gay for football to accept homosexuality. While several current top female players are openly gay, there has still yet to be a high-profile equivalent among their male counterparts.Megan Rapinoe, a World Cup winner with the United States who was named Ballon d’Or Feminin winner in 2019, is an LGBTQ+ activist and Miedema – the current PFA Women’s Player of the Year – is in a relationship with Arsenal team-mate Lisa Evans. But, while the likes of former Aston Villa and Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger announced he was gay following his retirement, the Premier League is still yet to see an active player do so. With a number of homophobic-related charges at football stadiums recently, tackling the issue remains a challenge for the Football Association and Miedema feels having a prominent gay male footballer would help change perceptions. “Obviously I like to think so,” the Netherlands international said when asked if a top men’s player coming out would help others and make homosexuality less of a stigma within the game. “If someone was to come out and that player is fully respected, from there on it would be easy for a lot of other boys to come out as well. I think you should do what you want and let people do whatever they feel good with.” The FA has both a 21-page document and a 10-point plan laying out how it is challenging homophobia and supporting gay players, while campaigns such as Rainbow Laces has increased wider awareness of the issue. “At the time right now I think we are too busy thinking about everybody else but ourselves and I think we need to focus on ourselves,” added Miedema. “Why does it change the player if he is gay or not? Why does it change the player if he or she is from Holland, from Africa, from Australia? We are all the same so why can’t we just accept how we are and who we are and go from there. Just enjoy football and enjoy life, that is how easy it is for me anyway.”The rise of social media platforms has presented the chance for racial and homophobic abuse of footballers to be both targeted and anonymous. But Miedema, 23, has called for team rivalries to be the only factor in separating fans. “I don’t like social media anyway so I would always say, no matter what happens, social media is going to be a place that always makes it worse,” she added. “For me personally, I don’t get why it is still an issue, especially in football because we all share the same passion. We are all the same. You all have the same passion, you all want to play football. Obviously there is always going be a rivalry, between Chelsea and Arsenal for example, but in the end you have all got the same goal so for me it doesn’t matter who is on the pitch and who you support. I think we should be smart and clever enough to keep it friendly, know where the line is and not cross that line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fcc94b6684b52b3ea9149093f10b9e005bfc359/1872_185_3663_2198/master/3663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3811be9fe95a6647bd567c20e26aa24","title":"premier league transfer window summer 2020 shut 1 september","story":"The Premier League has voted to revert to the same summer transfer window as Europe’s other major leagues after two years of going it alone.A majority of top-flight clubs agreed to a window that closes after the season has begun. The change will take effect from this summer, when the window will close at 5pm on 1 September.For the past two years the transfer window has shut on the eve of the Premier League season. It was a change instigated by the clubs who felt a later window disrupted their performance at the beginning of the season.It proved unsatisfactory for many clubs, particularly the “big six” who felt the early closure of the window, while other leagues stayed open, left them exposed to having players picked up by European rivals without the opportunity to replace them.Manchester United and Tottenham, in particular, were frustrated at an inability to properly restructure their squads last summer. It was widely known that Spurs wanted to sell Christian Eriksen but were unable to strike a deal during the English window. A fear of losing the player without a replacement then meant a disgruntled Eriksen remained at Tottenham until January, when he moved to Internazionale.The decision to revert to the previous system was made by the Premier League clubs at their regular shareholders’ meeting and was passed by a simple majority vote, a change from the normal procedure whereby any motion must pass with a two-thirds majority.It is understood a third proposal, that would have kept an early end to the window for deals between Premier League clubs, was rejected.

These factors, combined with growing uncertainty around the recent coronavirus outbreak, have led to the decision to cease operating services.”American Airlines and United Airlines, the two biggest US carriers, said on Wednesday they were suspending flights to Hong Kong until at least the end of the month.Conditions were as grave now as during the 2009 financial crisis, said Cathay Pacific. “I am appealing to each and everyone of you to help,” said CEO Augustus Tang Kin-wing. “Preserving our cash is now key to protecting our business,” he said.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, is under pressure to close all routes into Hong Kong from mainland China in order to stop the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 560 people, one of them in Hong Kong.She has already ordered all entrants from China to be quarantined for 14 days and has closed two cruise ship terminals after 30 crew on the World Dream vessel anchored in the city’s port on Wednesday were suspected of having the infection. Port health authorities were screening the 3,600 people onboard for symptoms on Thursday.The measures have caused anxiety in Hong Kong, where memories of the devastating 2003 outbreak of Sars – which is similar to the new coronavirus – are still fresh in people’s minds.Hongkongers have begun forming long queues in shops and supermarkets amid panic buying for toilet rolls and tissues, largely due to a rumour spreading online on Wednesday that China was going to stop manufacturing toilet paper for the next two weeks.There was also a run on face masks, vitamins, rice and packet noodles, leaving supermarket shelves empty.Neil, a British teacher who has been living in Hong Kong for 25 years, said the news of the first death of a Hong Kong citizen on Tuesday would add to the high state of anxiety being felt there. He said nearly everyone on the island was wearing a mask and there were shortages of some goods in the shops.“There’s been panic-buying of rice and noodles and eggs are off the shelves. I go to the supermarket and get what I need but I haven’t got any masks and I’m not going to queue for five or six hours to get them, so when I walk around without one I get looks,” he said.But the loss of visitors from China, who spend millions of dollars in Hong Kong’s many upmarket shops, and from the outside world risks a “double devastation” for the economy, according to retail chiefs.“We are facing a double-hit devastation,” said Annie Yau Tse, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association. “The loss we are facing is tremendous. It’s about survival.”“Although the protests seem to have lost momentum amid health concerns, the 2019 novel coronavirus would further weigh on the economy,” they said in a note on Tuesday. “Moreover, we believe that the political outlook in Hong Kong remains fragile, given that the ‘Five Great Demands’ of the protestors remain unmet, which suggests that large-scale protests would easily resume once the coronavirus epidemic subsides.”Only government spending would make a positive contribution to the bottom line, they said, as consumer spending and tourism faced huge falls.The tourism sector would be particularly badly hit, they said, as the closure of 11 out of 13 border crossings and the new quarantine measures would see a “significant” reduction of Chinese tourists, who make up three-quarters of holidaymakers.Business investment has also “taken a pounding” Fitch Solutions added, and could get much worse if the virus spreads more widely within Hong Kong, resulting in a Wuhan-style lockdown. Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia for the investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, said the wider Asia Pacific economy faced a gloomy outlook if the coronavirus crisis was not brought under control quickly.“Beyond tourism, the slowdown of China will curb import demand and also disrupt supply chain as many economies in Asia depend on China for imported parts for final production as well as lower Chinese demand for commodities pushing down prices. Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia are very impacted by this,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29485a681aece9e0a950b3b283747638d0a8309/0_702_6184_3711/master/6184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9bfd6d19609445c9ea26fcfdd9c6beb","title":"tell us about the pressures men are under to have children","story":"We would like to hear from men who are feeling under pressure to have children by a certain ageSome men feel pressure to have children by a certain age.

It featured Ford leading a gaggle of glammed-up, righteously pissed-off looking mums through Vancouver, with some of their kids in tow. They march down suburban pavements, dance with abandon and cruise the streets in a battered mobile home. At one point, Ford visits a record store and holds an Otis Redding album up to the camera, which figures.When Ford’s former bandmate in the Canadian group the Be Good Tanyas, Jolie Holland, struck out on a solo career, she concentrated on paring the band’s rootsy Americana down until it was stark and eerie (her version of their best-known song, The Littlest Birds, dramatically shifted its mood from amiable to chilling). But Ford has developed a sound rooted in warm southern soul. On Indian Ocean, she even employed the old house musicians from Memphis’ Hi Records – men who 40 years previously had played on Al Green’s classic 70s albums and Ann Peebles’ I Can’t Stand the Rain.In one sense, it was a bold move. The world is hopelessly overstuffed with artists plying variations on retro soul, from aged original practitioners rescued from obscurity by younger enthusiasts to post-Winehouse pop singers and the kind of bands who talk about “real music” and wish to signpost their disdain for the shallow fripperies of modernity. It’s tough to cut through this crowded market, but Ford’s albums do. Despite the presence of musicians who were there the first time around, Indian Ocean never sounded like a Sealed Knot re-creation or shallow pastiche. Ford wrote fantastic songs – everything from acute little character studies to stuff that sounded like gospel – and wove country and jazz into a sound that perfectly fitted her understated voice.She continues and refines this approach on U Kin B the Sun. The horn arrangements and the Hi Rhythm Section are gone – guitarist Teenie Hodges died before Indian Ocean was released. Its sound is barer: bass pushed to the front, gentle shadings of guitar and keyboards, lots of empty space. And the mood is darker. The lyrics touch on relationship strife in no-punches-pulled style on the bluntly titled Motherfucker on the survivors of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in The Kids Are Having None of It (“They can’t be bought, they can’t be taught your hate”) and on Ford’s complicated relationship with her parents, whom she has bluntly described as “a complete disaster”. The opening track, Azad, doesn’t make life as the daughter of young hippies constantly on the run from the draft sound like much fun: it takes the sight of a dragonfly to make her realise “there is beauty in this world, so hold it any way you know how”.In fact, it’s often hard to work out what the lyrics are about. Ford has a habit of smearing words to incomprehensibility, leaving it to the sound of her voice to convey the emotion of a song. Luckily, that’s something her voice is eminently capable of doing. Abundantly aware of the fact that less is more, her vocals are high, airy and textured with a gently fluttering vibrato but, as befits a woman who writes songs called things such as Motherfucker, you’d never describe them as delicate. They’re capable of landing a raw emotional punch or of conveying something more complex. On U and Me, which seems to be another breakup song, her tone switches from warm to wracked and back again, as sadness and loss are tempered by genuine fondness.For all the darkness of the subject matter, there is a warmth to the album. It makes sense that it comes with a cover dappled by sunlight. This is partly to do with the production which, for all its sparseness, has a lovely organic, intimate feeling – it frequently feels as though you’re eavesdropping on a band playing live – and partly to do with the strength of the melodies: choruses gently surge, vocal harmonies are sparingly applied but beautiful. The exception is the closing title track, which lasts the best part of six minutes. It comes to a halt midway through, then reassembles itself as a thick, dream-like swirl of sound, rich with echoing, multitracked vocals that sound positively ecstatic. As usual, it is hard to make out exactly what they’re singing, beyond the fact that Ford keeps repeating the word “joy”, as if reaffirming her dragonfly-induced childhood revelation about the beauty of the world.Its mood is heady and infectious, the perfect end to an album that doesn’t grab your attention with pyrotechnic displays, opting instead for a slow-burning, unassuming kind of power: a low-key delight, but a delight all the same.Elliot Adamson’s remix turns a poppy track inside out, transforming it into distorted, fierce acid house."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee2078a7fa99149383945ec1a5c8e85a26ae690/0_0_4607_3071/master/4607.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=832dcac5649ffe57590c591d32170a04 1440w","title":"council chiefs deserve role in labour shadow cabinet says lisa nandy","story":"Leadership candidate says she ‘couldn’t disagree more’ with plan put forward by Richard BurgonLabour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy has criticised Richard Burgon over his controversial proposal to ballot members before backing military action, which he put forward as part of his campaign to be the party’s deputy leader.Nandy said senior former Labour figures, who warned against the war in Iraq, would be “ashamed” of his plan and what it signalled for the future of the party.Speaking in Worksop to party members, Nandy attacked Burgon’s idea, saying she “can’t disagree with him more”.She said: “I have to say that I think Robin Cook would be ashamed of where we may end up as a party.“At times in our history there have been moments when we have had to stand up and go to protect people all over the world.“In Sierra Leone, and Rwanda, those people cannot wait for us to go and ballot Labour party members. I think everyone in this party understands that.”“We have a responsibility to protect and we have obligations to people outside our borders and that’s the kind of Labour party I will lead.”Earlier, Nandy said Labour should invite council leaders to attend its shadow cabinet as it tries to rebuild the party following the general election.The former shadow energy secretary, who is hoping to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader in April, announced that she would give the party’s grassroots a significant boost. She also suggested a change in its policies on local government.The approach to local councillors would strengthen Labour’s work in regaining the scores of “red wall” seats lost at the December poll, she suggested. Overall, the party lost 59 constituencies in their worst defeat since 1935.Addressing local councillors and residents in Worksop, Bassetlaw, which is represented by Conservative MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, she also suggested £12bn of funding for local enterprise partnerships (Leps) should go straight to local authorities.The Wigan MP said: “As a former councillor, I know that the role of local government must immediately be elevated in our party and especially when decisions are being made.“Under my leadership the elected Labour Local Government Association leader will have an open invitation to join my shadow cabinet meetings alongside our elected party leaders in Scotland and Wales.“Our councillors and their leaders possess so much insight and expertise through that we cannot afford to exclude them as we learn the hard lessons from successive election defeats.”The Labour leadership contest is entering its second month and so far Nandy, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey are through to the ballot paper.Nandy has emphasised how Labour needs to focus on revitalising towns, including significant investment in bus services, to secure the party’s future and a path back to electoral success.She said: “Local government has never been so important to our journey back to power in Westminster. We must strengthen the red thread from the work of all Labour councillors on the ground to the policies we develop as a Labour government in waiting.”She took aim at the structure of Leps, set up in 2011 by the coalition government, pointing out that they have received more than £12bn to drive economic growth in their local areas but added: “Most aren’t up to the job.”She said: “It’s time to give back control to local authorities so that money for regional investment is in the hands of democratically elected councillors. Let’s put power back in the hands of communities.”Nandy also wanted Labour councils to have the power to collectively nominate the next Labour leader. She believed it was bizarre that European Union Labour MEPs had nominating rights days before their roles became defunct but Labour councillors did not.She said: “If elected, I would review the leadership and deputy election process to ensure our councillors have an ability to make collective nominations alongside affiliates, MPs and constituency parties.“The role of local government needs to be elevated in our party. Our grassroots government needs a seat at the top table.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be337cfaf20aebe74a7920b6822c0128b70f43b7/28_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dccefe7180776a1b5a67b4e72acc221","title":"fishing eu countries seek tough stance on access to uk waters","story":"Coastal states with strong fishing interest want EU negotiators to be clearer on desire to maintain accessEuropean countries that fish in British waters are pushing for a tougher stance to protect their fishing crews before trade talks with the UK.Western coastal states made the call at a meeting of European Union ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday evening, the first high-level diplomatic talks on chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s draft negotiating mandate since its publication on Monday.EU sources said western coastal states with a strong fishing interest wanted Barnier’s text to be clearer that the EU would seek to maintain the same access to British waters, and the same quota shares for 100 types of fish that swim in shared seas.Boris Johnson has vowed to “take back control” of British waters, saying the UK would be an “independent coastal state” conducting annual negotiations with the EU as Norway does. On Wednesday it emerged that the UK has been quietly increasing its maritime defences in a bid to avoid a rerun of the 1970s “cod wars”.David McAllister, a German Christian Democrat MEP, who is leading the European parliament on EU-UK talks, said the issue of access to waters was inseparable from the overall deal, as well as access to European fisheries markets. Two-thirds of fish caught by British boats are exported to the EU.“The issue of free access to waters is inseparable from the issue of free trade and access of UK fisheries products to the EU market,” the MEP told journalists last week. “So the negotiations of the UK on fisheries cannot be disconnected and will have a direct link with the negotiations on trade in goods. It’s that simple. If the UK grants us access to territorial waters, to fish, then on the other hand the UK will have access to export fisheries to the single market.”At the Brussels meeting, Germany and the Netherlands said Barnier should be ambitious on post-Brexit police cooperation with the UK.As a non-EU country outside the EU’s border-free travel zone, the UK will be switched off from the Schengen information system when the transition period ends in 2020. Germany and the Netherlands said the EU needed to look at alternatives to sharing information, other than the SIS database, which has 64m entries of information on criminal suspects, identity documents and missing people and is used by British police every day.Diplomats were said to be very happy with Barnier’s text, which sums up the EU’s long-established positions – including the exclusion of Gibraltar from any EU-UK trade deal. Diplomatic sources say the document is more likely to become tougher, rather than weaker under the scrutiny of member states, before its adoption on 25 February.The meeting took place as MEPs on the newly-created “UK coordination group” met Barnier for the first time to give the European parliament’s input on the unprecedented negotiation with an ex-member state.Several MEPs told Barnier they were concerned about Boris Johnson’s statements about the Irish protocol, an integral part of the withdrawal agreement he signed last October. The prime minister has repeatedly said there will be no checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, although the agreement makes clear there will be checks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278aa6deefca91d55e7d7f786693a25df0e699d4/0_588_3874_2324/master/3874.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b932b3ecd06080c368bfdc9b58b5eeaf","title":"boardgame piece first viking raid found lindisfarne archaeology","story":"Small glass ‘crown’ thought to be rare archaeological link to first Norse raidersIt is not large – the shape and size of a chocolate sweet – and might easily have been discarded as a pebble by a less careful hand.But a tiny piece of worked glass unearthed during an excavation on Lindisfarne has been revealed to be a rare archaeological treasure linking the Northumbrian island with the Vikings, from the very beginning of one of the most turbulent periods in English history.Archaeologists believe the object, made from swirling blue and white glass with a small “crown” of white glass droplets, is a gaming piece from the Viking board game Hnefatafl, or a local version of the game.Whether dropped on the island by a Norse raider or owned by a high-status local imitating their customs, the gaming piece offers a rare tangible link between Lindisfarne’s Anglo-Saxon monastery and the culture that eventually overwhelmed it.Lindisfarne is arguably best known for its spectacular illuminated gospels, which were created in the early eighth century in the island’s first monastery. But to historians, “Holy Island” also has immense significance as the site, in AD793, of the first major Viking raid in Britain or Ireland, launching almost three centuries of destruction and occupation that dramatically shaped English history.The exact location of the early wooden monastery is not known – ruins visible on the island today are from a later priory – but recent excavations on the island by archaeologists and volunteers from DigVentures have located a cemetery and at least one building.The gaming piece, discovered last summer, came from a trench that has been dated to the eighth to ninth centuries, according to the project’s lead archaeologist, David Petts, putting it squarely in the most notorious period of the island’s history, around the time of the raid. Even if the game was being played by wealthy monks or pilgrims before the Vikings attacked, he says, it shows the influence that Norse culture already had across the north Atlantic.“We often tend to think of early medieval Christianity, especially on islands, as terribly austere: that they were all living a brutal, hard life,” says Petts, a senior lecturer in the archaeology of northern England at Durham University.In fact, he says, Lindisfarne at the time would have been a bustling place peopled with monks, pilgrims, tradespeople, and even visiting kings. “The sheer quality of this piece suggests this isn’t any old gaming set. Someone on the island is living an elite lifestyle.”It is particularly valuable as an artefact, he says, because “we are starting to get an insight into the actual lives of the people who were in the monastery, rather than just their cemeteries and their afterlives”.The gaming piece is unusual not only as an artefact but because of the manner of its discovery. DigVentures excavations are crowdfunded and staffed substantially by volunteers, and the find was made by the mother of one of the team members, who was visiting the site for a day to celebrate her birthday.“Several of the most significant finds from Lindisfarne have been made by members of the public,” says DigVentures’ managing director, Lisa Westcott Wilkins. “The big argument is that you can’t do real archaeology with members of the public: you can, as long as it is properly supervised.”When the piece was discovered, she says, “my heart was pounding, the little hairs on my arms were standing up. As a scientist, you have to train yourself out of having an emotional response to things like this. It’s a piece of evidence, bottom line.“But honestly, it’s just so beautiful and so evocative of that time period, I couldn’t help myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ae5d67df35af6089539eebbb26c8bf6e17df8b8/0_1173_3018_1811/master/3018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f748a364fe6046b8f84bb6a27c2b582a","title":"edwin moses interview donald mcrae athletics","story":"The number 999 is burned into Edwin Moses’s psyche. He holds the greatest winning streak in athletics for, as a two-time Olympic champion over the 400m hurdles, Moses was unbeaten for nine years, nine months and nine days. From August 1977 to June 1987, he won 122 successive races. But the worldly American, who is also a physicist and the chairman emeritus of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, has spent enough time in other countries, like Britain, to know that 999 is also the number to call in an emergency.For much of his life the struggle against doping has felt like an emergency to Moses. It explains why he has been at the forefront of anti-doping for 32 years and why, even now, he is such a vocal proponent of clean sport. Moses has helped lead the clampdown on Russia’s state-sponsored doping programme. He continues to monitor the situation in regard to a likely blanket ban on all Russian athletes competing in this summer’s Tokyo Olympics, even as “authorised neutrals”, and he is heartened that last week World Athletics hardened its stance. Real changes and genuine contrition needs to be shown by the Russian Athletics Federation to avoid the ban on all its inidual athletes. This is a fight Moses has waged for decades.“That’s why I worked out three times a day,” he says when asked if he felt the shadow of doping among his rivals even when he seemed invincible as an athlete. “I ate properly. I had a great stretching programme. I had a great physical therapist. I did all kinds of innovative training exercises. I swam. Did weights. But I also did it because I knew it would make me the best.”This was not the template used by cheating athletes. “We all knew it was happening,” Moses says. “We knew doping was wide-scale because there was no drug testing – beyond being able to detect drugs for three or four days. It was unabated. I’m a physicist. I’ve got a biology and chemistry background. I wanted to be a doctor. So I was shocked when I went to the 1976 Olympics and saw some of the Eastern Bloc women. They were much more manly than me. Then, in the 1980s, more athletes used performance-enhancing drugs because out-of-competition testing did not exist. There was no test for testosterone or growth hormones then. EPO was brand new. So there was unabated use of these drugs all over the world.“A few athletes spoke up but many made comments out of expediency. It was a dark period in my sport and it’s continued for a long time. It’s finally changing now. But I was one of the few who spoke out at the start. People who protest, and do the right thing, usually don’t have anything to gain. I was winning anyway so there was nothing for me to gain. I could have done nothing and track and field would have been worse than it is today. I made a difference. That’s why we have out-of-competition drug testing – because of what I and a few others did in 1988.”Athletics has never recovered from its loss of legitimacy in the aftermath of the Dirtiest Race in History, the 100m final at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when Ben Johnson, the initial winner, failed a drug test. Serious questions, at the very least, have been raised over the other seven finalists. Moses, who won bronze in the 400m hurdles at those Games, when he was 33 and competing in his final Olympics, felt an even sharper desire to clean up his sport.Does he expect Russia to back down and apologise? “No. I doubt it.”Moses is justifiably proud of his role in toughening up Wada – as the anti-doping agency seemed subservient to the IOC. Moses and Beckie Scott, the chair of Wada’s Athlete Committee, became embroiled in a row with the organisation. Scott said she was “bullied” in 2018 over her opposition to reinstating Russia’s anti-doping agency. Moses supported Scott and he was told to “shut up” by some Wada officials.Is the war against doping being won? “Our deterrent model is very important. New software packages mean we’re able to buy the right tests that can withstand the legal, analytical and statistical scrutiny required to prove a test is conclusive. Drugs are being detected for longer periods of time. They’re now looking at proteins in the body that change immediately upon use of growth hormone, testosterone, EPO. We can detect more because we’re looking at protein chains, 200 or 300 segments long, in the DNA. That’s brought in a whole new way of testing.”Moses is also a passionate ambassador for Laureus – the group which celebrates the power of sport to transform the lives of millions of people. He cites the moment when he was on stage with Nelson Mandela at the inaugural Laureus awards in 2000, as “one of the big moments of my life. What he said that night, about the power of sport, was so pertinent. I saw people crying in the audience. From then on I applied all the hard work, the discipline, the winning – all the positive things I learned from sport – to Laureus and helped build a great organisation. It’s been as satisfying as sport itself.”Stressing the wider social and political power of sport, Moses encourages athletes to protest openly against racism, homophobia and other forms of injustice. He talks knowledgeably about football’s enduring problems with racism and supports those England players who have discussed walking off the field the next time they are subjected to racial abuse. “I would agree with them. If that’s what it takes, that’s a small price to pay for the indignity human beings suffer. I would have walked off the track if I had seen something like that.”Moses also backs American athletes who have taken a knee against police brutality and racism in the US. In contrast, when asked about Donald Trump, Moses says, “I don’t even want to talk about our president.”The IOC has promised to ban all political protest at the Tokyo Olympics but Moses rejects this aim. “I don’t think you can stop it. It’s an inidual discretionary endeavour and history shows that you can’t stop protest.”Sporting history confirms that, for those nine years, nine months and nine days, Moses was also unstoppable. Before he races off to his next meeting in Atlanta I ask him about that astonishing streak which began after he lost a race in Berlin against the German 400m hurdler, Harald Schmid. A week later, in Dusseldorf, Moses beat Schmid by 15 metres. Did the pain of defeat drive him for the next decade?Was it particularly painful when, in June 1987, he finally lost a race to Danny Harris? “No. When I first started I lost all the time. Losing is part of the game. If you lose you figure out what you did wrong and fix it up. If it had been another five metres, I would probably have caught him. I’d been suffering from food poisoning and nearly pulled out. But I was paid my money and I ran.”A few months later, Moses beat Harris to clinch the world championship. “I was happy and the fact I had lost to him was beside the point. Most people lose.”Moses, however, almost always won.

Events could be screened live on a subscription channel so long as a terrestrial broadcaster was given secondary rights, as happens with England’s home cricket series. It was in no hurry for the Six Nations to do a deal with Sky but argued that if the tournament were restricted to the BBC or ITV, the value of the contract would depreciate. Sky was a valuable bargaining tool.The investment would make sense only were there to be a pay-TV element in the next broadcasting contract, even if the southern hemisphere unions agreed to the July and November tour matches being given a competitive makeover on the lines of World Rugby’s proposed Nations League that was shot down last year, albeit without relegation.The danger for CVC now is that a deal taking live matches off free-to-air would spark public outrage and probably a petition to the government for the tournament to be promoted to the A list – depressing its broadcast value.When that 2009 panel met, it was presented with figures showing a stark difference between the audiences generated by Sky, then the major subscription service in sport, compared with the BBC and ITV. The first leg of a Champions League semi-final that year between Manchester United and Arsenal had a viewing figure of 1.77m on Sky compared with 7.48m on ITV for the second leg. There was a similar 4-1 split for the 2005 and 2009 Ashes series on Channel 4 and Sky respectively.The Welsh Rugby Union submitted in 2009 that a Group A listing would “decimate the sport” in Wales and threaten its investment in the game. Meanwhile the Six Nations provided written evidence that concluded: “The Championship may be competed for by the national representative teams of the six participating rugby unions but it is NOT a public asset, owned by ‘the nation’.”“The technology and power of broadcasting means a sport cannot stand still,” says Richard Cramer, the managing partner of Front Row Legal, which specialises in sports, media and business. “Change is going to happen anyway and a question the Six Nations will be asking themselves is whether they have the expertise to manage it.“CVC does and it will have its eyes on overseas markets. If the Six Nations are satisfied that selling a stake to an outside partner will lead to increased revenues, it is a good reason to do it, although a hybrid television deal looks the most likely outcome.”• This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Albion studied politics, patriotism and the seductions of nostalgia through the prism of family life. It is now back at the Almeida with much of the old cast – Victoria Hamilton is still the formidable matriarch, Audrey – and its island-shaped stage.Why has Goold revived Bartlett’s play so soon? Because, he writes: “Plays, like plants, grow over time. Their meanings shift.” Britain’s departure from the EU inevitably changes the way this play is received. One character sneers at the “European temperament”, another speaks of the “shocking result of a completely unnecessary plebiscite” and the central garden on stage – which represents an old, unspoilt England for Audrey – is spoken of as a “battlefield”. Maybe the echoes and ironies in Albion will resound more deeply when we have greater real-life distance. Either way, it remains a deeply satisfying and powerful piece of theatre.In form, it is at once a sly satire of a country-house drama and a faithful enactment of it. Albion unfolds at an unhurried pace, there are explosive undercurrents between characters and plot turns are thrown in like hand grenades. Silences carry weight and Bartlett’s script is filled with ideas – and also grabs at our hearts.Miriam Buether’s set, designed as a garden, is planted into the ground by actors in a touching interlude, and then dug up just as movingly.Hamilton’s brisk, bossy Audrey, who has lost her son in war, sets about designing the garden of the crumbling country estate as a memorial to war veterans. Just as The Cherry Orchard’s Madame Ranevskaya looks out across her land and says: “Out there at least nothing has changed. My orchard gleams as white, as pure as ever”, so Audrey seeks to bypass the present and reinstate the glorious past.But the ground keeps shifting and she variously appears as a dangerous nativist and a romantic idealist. The soil itself becomes a potent symbol of British identity: it contains the ashes of her son, the bones of the war dead before him and, for Audrey, represents their sacrifice.Hamilton gives a tour de force but she is not the only fine performer. Nicholas Rowe offers light relief as her ineffectual husband Helen Schlesinger is both likable and offputting as Audrey’s accomplished friend Angel Coulby, as the girlfriend of Audrey’s dead son, and Daisy Edgar-Jones, as Audrey’s daughter, are engaging.Real-world politics cast a subtly different light on Bartlett’s play, just as in the Watermill’s 2018 revival of Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, and Albion gathers a truly mournful spirit by the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/701121aa2230da26facebc7901f2d43b4a8068b0/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab4c5a50f48789aac013fc89bf38f584","title":"mam review michael keegan dolan sadlers wells teac damsa","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonMichael Keegan-Dolan’s new dance work is steeped in the landscape and culture of the Dingle PeninsulaIt starts out like a sinister cult: the mask of a black ram, a curl of sweet-smelling smoke, a girl in a white communion dress confronted with a severe lineup of adults in black formal wear and paper-bag balaclavas. But then comes Cormac Begley and his enchanting concertina, with its mournful drone and scampering rhythms, its sound of tough lives and strong bonds. And it’s a spell. Music is a spell that runs right through this wonderful piece.Irish choreographer Michael Keegan-Dolan has spent the last two years living in the Dingle Peninsula and Mám is marinated in its landscape and community. Compared with his previous piece, Swan LakeLoch Na hEala, a brilliantly searing attack on the abuses of the Catholic church, Mám is more abstract and instinctive, but it effectively plays out a story of modernity intruding on traditional life.The first light-footed, shoulder-shrugging dance looks like guests at a wedding – or more likely a wake – and Keegan-Dolan’s organic choreography grows out of his eclectic community of dancers, including BBC Young Dancer winner Connor Scott – bringing a looseness to offset his sharp-angled precision – and the remarkable James O’Hara, an elastic dancer who doesn’t seem to have any straight lines in his body.Sometimes they move as if the music is in their heads, dancing on a memory more often rhythm finds a foothold and drags everyone into the present, and the pure connection of movement, music and people.But that’s only one side of the story. The scene is upturned by the arrival of outsiders, a new batch of musicians (the contemporary ensemble Stargaze). This invasion of traditional sound is cleverly done, with curiosity and impertinent challenge, the two sides in mad competition or shifting suspiciously around each other, and eventually finding concord, enrichment and some gorgeous, soaring chords floating over Begley’s restless jigs.Mám feels like a gathering unravelling into the wee hours, and all along the girl (Ellie Poirier-Dolan, the choreographer’s daughter) is an impassive observer, until a final coup de theatre points to where the future lies. Mám is full of engrossing dancing, fantastic music, subtle meanings and real humanity. This is a choreographer on a roll."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efe5a7903e2a8b2157e8e1655884f0cff67176b9/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13457ffb2f30413f8abadd37a35881b3","title":"how can i copy 1400 dvds to a new hard drive","story":"Harry has data backed up to DVDs, but wants to copy the files to a hard drive. Is there a quick way to do it?Over the years, I have been backing up files to writeable DVDs. I probably have around 1,400 of them. Now I want to transfer their contents onto a single 10TB USB hard drive. Can you and your erudite readers recommend the quickest solution?Is there a DVD recorder that can load 10 to 20 DVDs at a time and automatically copy them onto said 10TB hard drive? Also, are there any issues with the formats needed to ensure access to my data for another 10 years or more? HarryI expect many of us still have lots of optical discs stashed away, because CDs and DVDs were the most economical way to store data for 20 to 30 years. Just cutting one disc a week could get you over the 1,000 mark, though I assume most of them would have been recopied and recycled before now.The CD-R recordable format, storing 702MB, was launched in 1982, when my IBM PCXT’s hard drive stored 10MB. We didn’t get DVD+RW discs storing 4.7GB each until about 1998, when 4GB was a reasonable size for a hard drive. A decade later, an Amazon receipt tells me I bought a 500GB Western Digital My Book for £62.20, so I was probably switching from optical to digital disks some time around 2008, if not before.In theory, we might have switched from DVD to the new Blu-ray discs instead, because a Blu-ray can store either 25GB (single-layer) or 50GB (dual-layer) on archival discs. However, by the time Blu-ray writers became affordable, we already knew that external hard drives were going to win the storage wars. They were getting bigger and cheaper at a rapid pace. Today’s 8TB and larger drives confirm that we were right.Schofield’s First Law of Computing says: Never put data into a program unless you can see exactly how to get it out. I didn’t think to mention storage, or the effort it might take to retrieve it. Technically, your data is accessible, but the sheer volume of DVDs means it’s not very practical. Moving it to a hard drive makes sense, but there’s no obvious way to do it. Buying specialised hardware would be expensive while doing it manually could take a long time.Multi-DVD systems usually targeted either the disc duplication or data sharing markets. Products aimed at the first enabled companies to create lots of identical DVDs at once. Products aimed at the second were file servers, somewhat like giant jukeboxes. They enabled companies to share data from large numbers of DVDs or BDs, or create “cold storage” backups that could last for 50 years. Facebook, for example, developed a server to store 10,000 Blu-ray discs, and demonstrated the system in a three-minute YouTube video.MF Digital’s Ripstation 7000 Series CDDVDBD ripper should do what you want, but it costs $4,595, including the built-in PC. It uses a robot arm to pick up discs and drop them into a DVD tray. Products like this are aimed at radio and TV stations, publishing empires and educational institutions that needed – perhaps still need – to convert a lot of old discs into digital format. They are not expensive compared with the cost of humans doing it manually.I’m not sure if MF Digital’s cheaper Music CD Ripping Station would do the job because you don’t need to rip your discs, just copy them to a hard drive. However, I suspect £1,699.56 is more than you want to pay for a one-off job.That leaves you with one fast option: find a company that owns a Ripstation 7000 or similar device and offers file transfer as a service. I didn’t manage to find one – the search terms are tricky – and the price might still be prohibitive. I’d guess it would cost from 25p to £1 per disk, and 50p doesn’t sound too unreasonable. Even with a bulk deal, moving your data might cost £500. You’d also face the problem of shipping a very big box of discs at least one way.If anyone knows of an affordable DVD-to-HDD copying service, please let us know in the comments, or email me at the address below.If there’s no quick fix that you can justify on price, you will have to copy every DVD by hand. You could tackle it as a holiday project, but it’s a tedious way to spend your free time. Alternatively, set yourself a target, such as copying five to 10 discs per day, every day. Even with some breaks, you should get it done in a year. If you don’t set a target, you might never finish the job.Perhaps you could speed up the process by using two DVD drives, but it depends on the hardware you have available. A PC tower could take two internal DVD drives, but you would probably have to buy and install them.After that, it would be a boon to have some software to detect discs and copy the files automatically. This avoids waiting for the file directory to appear, highlighting the files you want, and dragging them to your hard drive.Perfect Automation has a utility that does the job well. You check the box for “Copy a lot of CDDVDs automatically” and start feeding it discs. It copies each one to a new folder that it creates on your hard drive (CDDVD1, CDDVD2 etc), then pops out the DVD tray for the next disc. It’s a small (219K), free program and doesn’t need to be installed, so it’s worth a try.I also tried Averk’s free AutoCopy 2, which is even smaller at 184KB. Averk had much the same problem as you – he wanted to move more than 100 CDs to a hard drive – and wrote a little utility to do it. Unlike Perfect Automation’s program, AutoCopy 2 includes a countdown timer. While its copying took longer than Perfect Automation on my system, I found that both were faster and more reliable than doing it manually.The first task is to copy all the DVDs to a hard drive and, obviously, to a backup hard drive: you don’t want to do this job twice. You can worry about file formats later.Over the long term, the best choices are usually the most common formats, especially if they are ratified international standards. Given the cost of storage nowadays, it’s not worth converting files to more efficient, space-saving formats, because this takes time and may involve some loss of quality. I’m leaving my jpg and png images, mp3 music, avi videos and other files in their original formats.Even DVD-quality movies are rarely worth the effort, unless they are of holidays, weddings, or your kids’ birthday parties. DVDs have a resolution of 720 x 480 pixels (American NTSC) or 720 x 540 (UK PAL). Today, we live in a 1080p world (1920 x 1080 pixels) on the way to 4K (3840 x 2160). You can probably watch the same videos in much higher quality on Netflix, Amazon Prime, BritBox, YouTube or some other streaming service.Have you got a question?

We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

The HBO show will focus specifically on voguing, the dance style popularised by the Madonna song Vogue and the cult documentary Paris Is Burning and features rapper and singer Megan Thee Stallion on its judging panel. Dashaun Wesley – from the hit ballroom-culture drama Pose – will serve a commentator.The public response to Jamil’s appointment focused on her perceived lack of ties to its subject matter. On Wednesday, she tweeted a statement in which she came out as queer, saying that she had kept her sexuality a secret “because I was scared of the pain of being accused of performative bandwagon jumping, over something that caused me a lot of confusion, fear and turmoil when I was a kid”. She emphasised that coming out did not automatically entitle her to a place on the show, adding: “I know that my being queer doesn’t qualify me as ballroom. But I have privilege and power and a large following to bring to this show … sometimes it takes those with more power to help a show get off the ground so we can elevate marginalised stars that deserve the limelight and give them a chance.”Jamil, who is in a relationship with singer James Blake, is no stranger to online controversy. With a personal brand focused largely on body positivity, she has spoken out against the Kardashians – dubbing the reality TV stars “double agents for the patriarchy” – and speaking out against airbrushing, detox teas and women’s attitudes towards mens’ height among other topics. In October, she rolled back on comments defending Ellen DeGeneres’s friendship with George W Bush, saying that she had only just learned “the full extent of Bush’s heinous presidency … we weren’t taught much about him at school, we just heard he was stupid. I now understand the rage”.Produced by the makers of Netflix hit Queer Eye, Legendary will see voguing teams compete for a cash prize and will air on HBO’s forthcoming streaming platform HBO Max."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/897b012f945ca17b2b736dc64cf7abac4f767ae2/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b52718b80061c3daef7e7bb7700aa2b8","title":"pete buttigieg bernie sanders nearly tied iowa caucuses","story":"Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are nearly tied in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, with almost all results counted in a contest marred by technical issues and reporting delays.A new batch of results released just after midnight narrowed the margin between Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont.

The nearly complete results show them leading Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, with former vice-president Joe Biden and senator Amy Klobuchar trailing behind.But the results in Iowa were muddied by the stunning breakdown of the caucus reporting process in a state that traditionally kicks off presidential nominating contests. Iowa officials initially attributed a delay in reporting results to technical problems with an app that precinct chairs were supposed to use to record votes, then to backlogs as those volunteers tried to call the party to submit their totals.Much of the political world has already shifted its attention to next-up New Hampshire, which holds the first primary election in the Democrats’ 2020 nomination fight on Tuesday. Both Buttigieg and Sanders are leading contenders there, as well.The two men are separated by 40 years in age and conflicting ideology.Sanders, a 78-year-old self-described Democratic socialist, has been a progressive powerhouse for decades. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old former municipal official, represents the more moderate wing of the Democratic party. Buttigieg is also the first openly gay candidate to earn presidential primary delegates.Sanders and his supporters raised issues with the primary process after the 2016 election, prompting the Democratic National Committee to make changes that affected the Iowa reporting regulations.The final alignment results are used to determine state delegate equivalents, which is the metric the AP has long used to call the winner of the caucus.

Last September a court ruled that the AfD’s state leader, Björn Höcke, could legally be termed a fascist, saying such a designation “rests on verifiable fact”.Speaking during a state visit to South Africa, Merkel described the circumstances of Kemmerich’s election as “a singular process that broke with a fundamental conviction of mine and my party’s, namely that you don’t win majorities with the help of Alternative für Deutschland.”The FDP’s national leader, Christian Lindner, travelled to Thuringia’s state capital, Erfurt, on Thursday, with some German media reporting that he would try to convince Kemmerich to resign less than 24 hours after accepting his mandate.On Wednesday afternoon Lindner insisted Kemmerich was “the candidate of the centre” and rejected accusations that the vote had been pre-arranged with the far right, saying he had been surprised by the outcome.But reports since have questioned the FDP leader’s version of events. The CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, said she had explicitly warned Lindner that the AfD could use his candidate as a vehicle to gain political influence.The AfD had fielded its own candidate in the anonymous third round of voting, without lending him any of its votes.The German-owned news website Business Insider cited anonymous party insiders as saying Lindner had given the green light for Kemmerich to accept his mandate in the event of a surprise victory.Merkel too appeared to criticise the FDP, a right-leaning pro-business party with liberal roots that used to be a natural junior coalition partner for the Christian Democrats.She said Kemmerich gaining a majority only with the help of the far right had been predictable. “Therefore it has to be said that this process is unforgivable and the result has to be reverted,” she said.The events in Thuringia were met with protests in several cities around the country, including Berlin, where about 1,000 people gathered outside the FDP headquarters. In Erfurt, protesters formed a human chain outside the parliament, chanting: “Who betrayed us? Free Democrats!”Leading members of Germany’s “grand coalition” – forged between Merkel’s conservatives and the SPD in 2018 – are due to meet at the weekend to discuss the situation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/044363d86f523b8e397bdba130690180fe981aa8/0_150_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68937b510879384ed06523ca1a93bd06","title":"britons feeling far less satisfied life official data shows","story":"Two ONS indexes measuring national mood fell significantly for first time in last quarterYou probably already suspected this, but people in the UK are not feeling altogether happy with life. For the first time since the Office for National Statistics started measuring wellbeing, indexes of both life satisfaction and the feeling that things done in life are worthwhile have declined significantly.After a trend of rising life satisfaction between 2011 and 2016 and plateauing scores until late 2018, the measure of contentment fell for the first time in the quarter to autumn 2019, according to data released on Thursday.At the same time an index of “feelings that the things done in life are worthwhile” also fell, making it the first time both had dipped significantly year on year since 2011, when the statistics body began measuring wellbeing and happiness.“It is the first significant change since early 2015 in what was a stable picture of life satisfaction in the UK,” the statisticians said.A third measure of “happiness” also dipped while average anxiety ratings remained at an elevated level in the quarter to September 2019, with about 10.6 million people feeling high anxiety.The figures come from the government’s annual population survey, a continuous household survey capturing data from 320,000 people, the largest of its type.Any consequences of our mood and happiness resulting from the December general election and Britain’s departure from the EU last week will not be known until later in the year, when figures are released for those periods.The ONS suggests the dip in the national mood could be linked to households’ economic worries, even though they may not be well-founded.The data showed that household expectations about future unemployment worsened in the last year, even though actual unemployment continued to fall.The statisticians said the deterioration in personal wellbeing would reflect those worries it suggested could have been caused by widespread media coverage of business failures, with Debenhams going into administration and Boots and Marks \u0026amp Spencer among those announcing store closures.Equally, households’ expectations for the future of the economy as a whole continued to decline as they have done since 2014, becoming increasingly negative. That is despite households’ views of their own financial situation improving and becoming more positive.“Expectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person which grew at its slowest rate since the end of 2016,” the ONS said. People were spending less on cars than in 2016, and spending on recreation, culture and holidays also slowed over the last two years.All of the measures of happiness and wellbeing remain higher than in the immediate aftermath of the financial crash.Other recent research has shown more subtle influences on happiness, such as the trend towards more flexible working."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09eb9fb78a9ea9bbc6d9cbaa7307f1b02263301a/0_151_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0befcbeaf9e0823a8da6694156773682","title":"coronavirus cruise ship tokyo diamond princess life passengers","story":"Passengers on the Diamond Princess are experiencing fear, uncertainty and dark humourIt began as an expensive, luxury cruise around east Asia, but for the 2,666 passengers onboard the Diamond Princess, the holiday of a lifetime has turned into a waiting game marked by fear and uncertainty, and a touch of gallows humour.On Monday, as they prepared to dock in Yokohama, near Tokyo, to savour the final few days of their adventure, the passengers and 1,045 crew found themselves trapped by the coronavirus outbreak.After it emerged that a recently disembarked passenger, an 80-year-old man from Hong Kong, had tested positive for the virus, Japanese health authorities prevented the ship’s multinational inhabitants from disembarking and began the arduous task of checking their health, with those believed to be at risk later undergoing tests.Two days later, 20 people among 102 whose results had been confirmed were found to be infected, with 171 others nervously awaiting their results.The thousands who were never tested, or tested negative, now face at least 12 more days confined to their cabins, unable to directly communicate with each other, their meals brought to them by staff in masks and protective clothing.A few have shared their thoughts on social media about life in floating quarantine off Yokohama, with Tokyo Bay and the Chiba peninsula on one side, and Japan’s second city on the other.Paul and Jackie Fidrmuc, who are among 233 Australians onboard, were trying to ward off cabin fever by staying positive. “We are just kind of sitting tight really,” Jackie said. “It’s a little bit daunting. But look, we can’t do anything, we are good strong healthy people and we’ve got good immune systems and fingers crossed that ... we can fight it off.“It’s a frightening situation but it is not a disease where if you get it, it’s certain death. You just have to be lighthearted about the whole situation.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.David Abel, a British man who has provided regular video updates via Facebook, said he and his wife Sally – who are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary – had accepted they were no longer on holiday.“We’re no longer on a cruise,” he said on Thursday. “All of the luxury of having a steward come into the cabin to make the bed and put chocolates on the pillow, change the towels and facecloths and clean the bathroom – those days are gone. It just ain’t happening.”The endless supply of buffet food and drink, along with activities, entertainment and shore visits, has abruptly dried up, replaced by what to the passengers must seem like relative austerity: one hot drink a day, no-frills meals and, according to Abel, a suspension of laundry and linen services.The cancelled itinerary for Wednesday included a dizzying array of activities, including tai chi and origami classes, Bible study, line dancing, bingo, karaoke, and “Music and Martinis with the Evergreen Duo” in the Crooners bar. Instead, passengers pinned their hopes on finding enough on-demand movies to sustain them during the long days ahead.But there was humour amid the resignation and uncertainty. One male passenger, who opened a Twitter account at the start of the quarantine, said he and his wife’s ninth wedding anniversary had been marked by news of another 10 infections among their fellow passengers. “Happy anniversary!” he wrote.Some celebrated minor victories: expanded lunch and dinner menus, breakfasts delivered at the appropriate time, an internet connection upgrade, a bigger movie selection, and, in Abel’s case, words of thanks from a masked female crew member whose concerned mother had been reassured by his video posts.Others tweeted photos of recently delivered playing cards, as well as sudoku and other puzzles that had been delivered to their rooms.On Thursday, the irrepressibly good-humoured Abel used his newfound online fame to issue a couple of requests. Life would be more tolerable, he said, with a daily banana and a glass of whisky, preferably a Talisker 10-year-old single malt served straight.On a more serious note, he added: “It’s a horrible situation for most passengers onboard, being stuck here, confined to the cabin,” he said, referring to those staying in cabins without a sea-view balcony. “It must be almost unbearable for them.”On Thursday evening, just two days into at least a fortnight of quarantine, they were told they would be allowed on the open deck for 90 minutes under the supervision of quarantine officers. They must stay one metre apart from each other and not make physical contact or form groups.Despite the restrictions, a blast of fresh air blowing in from the Pacific could not come soon enough for Clyde and Renee Smith, an American couple who are on the ship with their two adult grandsons.The couple’s room “is tiny, we don’t have a window, there are four of us – and only one chair”, Renee, 80, said earlier in the day, adding that they had passed the time by watching films.Their 25-year-old grandson, Sawyer Smith, was trying to stay in shape by doing sit-ups now that he was unable to visit the ship’s gym. “It’s not really to the point where we’re getting stir-crazy,” he said. “If they keep us in the rooms for four to five days it might be a little different.”Agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"People Before Profit-Solidarity call for left wing parties to avoid \u0026lsquodisastrous mistakes\u0026rsquo of past coalitionsMary Newman Julian tells farmers at mart: \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquoll work hard for ye and rural Ireland\u0026rsquoParty criticises promises of both tax cuts and increased public spendingMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues wind and rain warning for Saturday as Storm Ciara crosses the country\u0026lsquoThere is a complete lack of awareness about the barriers thousands of people face\u0026rsquoParty supports a \u0026lsquocomplete freeze on all residential rents\u0026rsquo for a number of yearsPSNI investigate link between device found on truck in Lurgan and warning for Belfast DocksPaul Frew says Sinn F\u0026eacutein finance minister \u0026lsquoshouldn\u0026rsquot have time to get his coat\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoYou will struggle with your weight if you have fast food two to three times a week\u0026rsquoResearchers say genetic mutations driving the disease begin long before any other indications\u0026lsquoI have never voted for Sinn F\u0026eacutein in my life and this time I\u0026rsquom thinking of voting for them\u0026rsquoFile to be prepared for DPP on killing of former chef Timmy HourihaneDUP MP says it \u0026lsquogrates\u0026rsquo that Irish parties \u0026lsquorecoil\u0026rsquo at power sharing with Sinn F\u0026eacuteinSF president had denied Conor Murphy linked Paul Quinn murder with criminalityIt is expected two solar probes observing the sun will revolutionise solar science"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4163858.1580993801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 is sinn f%C3%A9in s housing policy credible","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenser housing with good access to urban centres is considered better than housing estates on the outskirts of towns. Photograph: Getty ImagesIt’s been called a “con job”, a “three-card trick”, and earlier this week, business leaders warned of its “grave implications for the economy”. There’s no doubt the Sinn Féin manifesto has been the most talked-about document of the election campaign.The most eye-catching aspect is the promise to spend €6.5 billion providing 100,000 new public homes on public land.Amid a hyper-charged political atmosphere on housing issues, it has prompted accusations that Sinn Féin is claiming it is possible to build houses for just €65,000 each,But what exactly is the party promising? And is it credible?Is Sinn Féin claiming it can build houses for €65,000 each?In a word, no. But you could be forgiven for thinking that, given how it’s phrased in the manifesto. The party promises it will “build 100,000 homes over 5 years. This will include council housing and affordable homes for renters and first time buyers. Cost – €6.5 billion.”This has given rise to the €65,000 figure – by simply iding the €6.5 billion budget by the 100,000 homes. Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin told The  that included in the 100,000 figure are 50,000 social homes, which, he says, are already committed to and budgeted for under the National Development Plan. So half of the headline figure is to be achieved before the €6.5 billion budget is touched.However, the implication is still that around €6.5 billion will pay for 50,000 new homes. That would suggest, by the same (fairly crude) measurement as above, that a home can be built for around €130,000. Can this be achieved?Two figuresIn truth, there’s a lot of numbers that get in the way of analysing this policy. It’s easier to forget nearly all the sums listed above, because only two really matter: €50,000 and €234,000.First up, the €50,000 figure. This is what Sinn Féin claims it will cost, per unit, to deliver the majority (some 30,000) of the 50,000 homes it has promised. It’s important to note that under the model chosen to deliver these homes, called affordable purchase, the €50,000 is not the cost of building the home, it’s the cost of each unit to the exchequer.The best example of this model is the O’Cualann development in Dublin. It works because a site is provided by the state, almost free of cost. That site is often also serviced, meaning connected to utilities, at no cost to the builder (but there is an exchequer cost). Development levies are also waived. The remainder of the development cost is provided by loans, redeemed when the homes are sold.The net result on O’Culann land is that three-bedroom homes retail for around €220,000. Sinn Féin has budgeted a cost to the exchequer for the waived fees, the site and the services of €50,000 per unit. Hugh Brennan, the chief executive of O’Cualann, says that the notional cost of most of his sites in Ballymun, where it has built homes, is around €37,000. Unsurprisingly, he is bullish about the possibility of rolling out the O’Cualann model around the country at a cost of €50,000 per unit. That figure, he says, is “not only credible, you’ll get change back”. He also argues that in reality, the exchequer is a net beneficiary due to economic activity during construction.Of course, in the real world things would be more complicated O’Cualann is the best example of this model in the state, but it has only delivered 50 units so far, with another 50 slated for this year. Whether the model can be ramped up to that scale, and at a level of €50,000 per unit, is open to debate. There is considerable skepticism among some well-placed sources about the feasibility of this.The next figure, €234,000, is what Sinn Féin are claiming they can build the remaining 20,000 homes for. Ó Broin says these will be composed of 10,000 social rental units and 10,000 affordable rental units.The party has sourced the figure from a parliamentary question answered last year on the average cost of building one, two, three and four bedroom local authority new build units. According to the reply, the average all-in cost submitted by local authorities over the 12 months to April 2019 of a three bed, including VAT and non-construction elements, is €234,571.Multiply that by 20,000 units and you get €4.7 billion. When you add in what Sinn Féin are allowing for inflation, the total cost of the plan is €6.469 billion.The outstanding issue is whether 20,000 units can be delivered for an average of €234,000. You have to consider what contributes to that figure, but also what policy goals the State should have for housing in the future.First of all, it’s important to note that the €234,000 is a national average. The PQ reply doesn’t make clear exactly what that average is composed of, but it is likely not entirely comprised of the kind of units that housing experts say we should be aiming to build in the future.Given demographic, environmental and urbanisation trends, the generally held view is that future housing should be more dense than existing stock, closer to urban centres, allow for smaller household sizes, and that developments should contain a variety of different housing types to allow for different points in the life cycle. Basically, they shouldn’t be big, sprawling estates of three bed semi-detached houses on the edge of town, which are cheap to produce because construction on open land is easy and they’re all the same type of unit.According to Ronan Lyons, an economist in Trinity College Dublin and property market expert, “when you look at where the country needs to be in 2060, we need significant increases in density and we need to accommodate much more variety in household type”.It’s debatable whether all this can be achieved for an average cost of €234,000. For example, Dublin City Council apartment developments currently being developed in central locations are costing the local authority around €370,000 each.It’s also worth looking at something called “unit cost ceilings”, which are limits imposed by the Department on what a local authority can spend on a new social housing unit. They’re higher than the cost of a new build as when the Department is drawing them up, the cost of acquiring units as well as building them is taken into account. But it’s still worth noting under these guidelines, the average figure permitted for spending on a three bedroom house in one of the Dublin local authorities is €292,500 for a two bedroom apartment, which may be more representative of the desired housing mix going forward, it’s €310,000.For Cairn Homes (the state’s largest homebuilder) once the profit margin, VAT and cost of land are stripped out, the average cost of delivering a unit is understood to be between €200,000 and €250,000. But whether the State could achieve the same costs as a listed homebuilder is, again, up for debate. Sinn Féin believe that advances in construction techniques and economies of scale would play in their favour, but would they do so to a sufficient scale? And is that hope enough to rely on when committing such a huge budget? That is an open question.Logistical challengesImplementing such an ambitious building programme would also entail significant logistical challenges. Sinn Féin claim that changes to the stamp duty regime would refocus the construction industry away from commercial property and towards residential delivery, but the property market is dynamic and complex, so can this be taken for granted? One academic source, who asked not to be named, points out that local authorities and approved housing bodies have built, between them, about 120,000 units in the thirty years since 1990. “Building 100,000 dwellings over the next five years would be an unprecedented ramping up of construction and would be almost impossible to achieve in my view,” the source said.There are more open questions: How would Children’s Hospital-style overruns be avoided? What if the inflation effect on building costs was significantly more than has been priced in by the party? Of course, this all also presumes that the revenue raising measures elswhere in the manifesto are effective.The Sinn Féin housing targets in its manifesto are based on real data and the party has been transparent about how it has arrived at these figures, for which it should be commended. However, like many manifesto promises, its delivery would be contingent on some rosy assumptions, and a dash of magical thinking to get around some pretty serious logistical hurdles. Whether the plan could survive contact with the real world remains to be seen.Is it possible? In the words of one property developer (who, it must be conceded, is far from a Sinn Féin voter): “It’s possible, but it’s highly f***in’ improbable.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4163818.1580991376!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dissident bomb on armagh lorry may have been meant for brexit day ferry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSilverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan.

On Monday evening he said police received a further report that the explosive device had been attached to a lorry belonging to a named haulage company. “This more detailed information enabled police to conduct focused investigations with the haulage company,” he said. “Working throughout the evening of Monday, February 3rd and Tuesday, February 4th, police and the haulage company eliminated in the region of 400 vehicles in order to locate the explosive device. “The device was subsequently found attached to a heavy goods vehicle in the Silverwood Industrial Estate. That explosive device was made safe.” Det Supt Wright said it was “clear from the information available to police that dissident republicans deliberately and recklessly attached an explosive device to a heavy goods vehicle. “Had this vehicle travelled and the device had exploded at any point along the M1, across the Westlink or into the Harbour estate the risks posed do not bear thinking about. “The only conclusion that we can draw is that once again dissident republicans have shown a total disregard for the community, for businesses and for wider society.”He appealed for anyone who was in the area of Silverwood Industrial Estate between 4.00pm and 10.00pm on Friday, January 31st and who may have noticed any unusual activity to contact police. “In addition I ask that anyone who was driving in the area and who would have dash-cam footage around these same times that they contact police, as a matter of urgency,” he said. “Police can be contacted on the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4163787.1580987761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup politician urges conor murphy to resign over paul quinn ","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin finance minister Conor Murphy  at Stormont Buildings. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPAA DUP Assembly member for the first time has called on the Sinn Fein Newry and Armagh MLA Conor Murphy to stand down as Minister for Finance in the Northern Executive.After the Quinn family rejected Mr Murphy’s apology for saying their murdered son Paul was involved in criminality, and repeated that he should resign, North Antrim DUP MLA Paul Frew said the Minister “shouldn’t have time to get his coat” in quitting office.Senior DUP politicians such as First Minister Arlene Foster have been careful in their comments but Mr Frew has now put out a tweet saying Mr Murphy should stand down as Minister.“The Quinn family have lived through a tortuous period of grief at the tragic loss \u0026amp murder of their son compounded by the slur, alienated by the republican movement,” he wrote in a post late on Wednesday night.“If the Quinn family say Conor Murphy should resign, he shouldn’t have time to get his coat,” said Mr Frew.That post was retweeted by DUP MLA for Upper Bann Jonathan Buckley.While the controversy has focused on the general election in the South the issue now appears to be having an impact on Northern Ireland politics which last month saw the restoration of the Northern Executive and Assembly.Mr Quinn, from Cullyhanna, Co Armagh, was brutally beaten to death by up to 10 men in a barn in Co Monaghan on October 20th, 2007. His family has always held the IRA responsible.When asked had he any evidence for the original comments Mr Murphy told RTE, “I am not going to go into what the evidence was or wasn’t at the time. The fact is that regardless of what my view was at the time those remarks added to the grief of a family. It was the wrong thing to do at the time.”Further asked was it his view that Paul Quinn had been involved in criminal activity Mr Murphy said he accepted that there was no evidence to link him to such criminality.Paul Quinn’s parents Breege and Stephen said that the reason they did not accept Mr Murphy’s apology and still wanted him to resign was because he had not said their son was not a criminal.Instead he had apologised for his remarks and rather than say he was not a criminal he said there was no evidence he was involved in criminality and fuel smuggling.Mr and Ms Quinn said they were satisfied that Sinn Fein leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill had accepted and acknowledged Paul Quinn was not a criminal.Unreservedly withdrawnSinn Fein however has rejected the Quinns’ interpretation and insisted that Mr Murphy’s statement met their demands. A Sinn Fein spokesman pointed to how Mr Murphy in his statement said, “I apologise for those remarks and I unreservedly withdraw them.”The spokesman stressed that Mr Murphy as well as apologising had unreservedly withdrawn his initial comments.Senior Ulster Unionist Party figures such as Steve Aiken and Doug Beattie and Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister have said Mr Murphy should not continue as Minister.DUP leader Ms Foster made no such demand. When she appeared on Wednesday with Ms O’Neill at a Stormont committee that scrutinises the Executive Office she was asked by Ulster Unionist member Mike Nesbitt was she happy to continue to work alongside Mr Murphy.Ms Foster said Executive appointments were made by inidual parties and that Mr Murphy’s future in the role was “a matter for Sinn Fein”.She added, “Wherever possible, if mistakes are made, we should reflect.I haven’t heard Conor’s apology, but I think it is right that should happen.I’m sure Mr and Mrs Quinn would want above all to have justice for their son.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4163872.1580995740!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il calls on conor murphy to resign over paul quinn remarks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStephen and Breege Quinn at the graveside of their murdered son Paul Quinn at St Patrick’s Church Cullyhanna Co. Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireFianna Fáil has called on Sinn Féin’s finance minister in the North to resign following the controversy over comments he made where he linked a murdered man to criminality.Conor Murphy on Wednesday retracted and apologised for comments he made claiming Paul Quinn had been involved in criminality and smuggling.Mr Quinn (21), from Cullyhana,Co Armagh, was brutally beaten to death by up to 10 men in a barn in Co Monaghan on October 20th, 2007. His family has always held the IRA responsible.Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan on Thursday called for Mr Murphy’s resignation.“I think Conor Murphy should resign. If his apology was genuine he would have issued that apology to the Quinn family 13 years ago. But the apology was really designed to protect and promote the interests of Sinn Féin in the run-up to a general election,” Mr O’Callaghan said.“What it reveals is that whenever there is a conflict between the interests of a family seeking justice on the one hand, and the interests of the provisional IRA or people involved in crime on the other hand, Sinn Féin will always opt for the latter.”Speak to PSNIMeanwhile Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has rejected any suggestion that Mr Murphy is resisting speaking to police about the murder of Mr Quinn. Ms McDonald added: “At the time, the International Monitoring Committee (IMC) took a judgement in terms of Paul’s murder, and by the way those that carried out that diabolical act need to be apprehended and put behind bars.” The IMC originally said current and former members of the IRA may have been involved but stated in its full report in May 2008 that the IRA was not responsible. Breege Quinn, mother of Mrl Quinn, has called on Mr Murphy to go to the PSNI with the names of people in the IRA he spoke to in the aftermath of the killing. Mr Murphy on Wednesday retracted and apologised for comments he made in the immediate aftermath of the murder .The Sinn Féin MLA said at the time he had spoken with IRA members in Cullyhanna, Co Armagh, where the Quinn family live, and was assured the IRA was not involved. When asked had he any evidence for the original comments Mr Murphy told RTÉ, “I am not going to go into what the evidence was or wasn’t at the time. The fact is that regardless of what my view was at the time those remarks added to the grief of a family. It was the wrong thing to do at the time.”Asked was it his view that Mr Quinn had been involved in criminal activity Mr Murphy said he accepted there was no evidence to link him to such criminality.Mr Quinn’s parents, Breege and Stephen, said the reason they did not accept Mr Murphy’s apology and still wanted him to resign was because he had not said their son was not a criminal. They have called on him to give the names of the IRA members he spoke with to the PSNI. Mr Murphy has said he has already met the PSNI about Mr Quinn’s murder. “If they feel they have anything helpful to add to their inquiries, I will happily meet them at any stage,” Mr Murphy said.Sinn Féin, however, has rejected the Quinns’ interpretation and insisted Mr Murphy’s statement met their demands. A Sinn Féin spokesman pointed to how Mr Murphy in his statement said: “I apologise for those remarks and I unreservedly withdraw them.”The spokesman stressed Mr Murphy as well as apologising had unreservedly withdrawn his initial comments.Elsewhere former Minister for Justice Michael McDowell joined Sinn Féin’s other political opponents by attacking the party over its handling of the Quinn family’s ordeal. Mr Murphy should resign as the North’s finance minister for refusing to retract his remarks for more than a decade, said Mr McDowell. Sinn Féin had “put it around” that Mr Quinn was involved in criminality – which was “wholly untrue”, said Mr McDowell. “The simple fact is that Conor Murphy has for the last 12 years, despite being appealed to weekly and monthly, by the Quinn family to retract that slur on their son, he has refused point blank to do it.”Mr Murphy only apologised “under massive pressure” when party leader Ms McDonald “made a mess of the issue on television”, said Mr McDowell. “He is the man who would not change, would not budge, would not retract until he saw votes going out the window in the Republic”, he added.Mr McDowell also said the killing was carried out by members of the IRA. “There is no doubt about it,” he said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"harry mcgee s final seat prediction for election 2020","story":"There is an apocryphal quote that is often attributed to the late US president Lyndon Johnson about the vagaries of elections. After losing a particularly bitterly-fought election, he is reputed to have said: “The people have spoken, the bastards.” Predicting election campaigns in Ireland is a guessing game that sometimes presents itself as an inexact science. Opinion polls and the results of secondary elections such as council elections, byelections and European elections give you the direction of the wind. But the system we have in Ireland of multi-seat constituencies allied with transferable votes makes it a very difficult exercise to carry out with any degree of accuracy.No tally taken prior to voting could have told you that Bríd Smith of People Before Profit would win the last seat in Dublin South-Central in 2016, by less than 40 votes, from Fianna Fáil’s Catherine Ardagh, relying wholly on the distribution of a tiny surplus that had got Joan Collins over the line in a previous count.Usually, there are predictors. For this general election it was last year’s round of local and European elections, as well as the autumn opinion polls, plus the November byelections. But they have all been thrown out the window since the start of the campaign. In Lazarus fashion, Sinn Féin has confounded expectations and become the party for the strong prevailing mood of the electorate: and that is change. Nobody foresaw it, not even Sinn Féin. The party now lacks candidates in constituencies where it might have won a second seat. Fine Gael has tumbled down. Fianna Fáil looks like it’s treading water a bit but there might be a latent support there. Of the rest, only the Greens look stronger, but outside Dublin, they remain niche.The 33rd Dáil will have an extra two seats compared with the outgoing Dáil, bringing the total up to 160. That means extra seats in Cavan-Monaghan, Kildare South and Dublin Central. In addition, Laois and Offaly combine into one constituency, with five seats overall rather than six.Here is my tally, broken down by party and where I see they may gain some seats and lose others.1. Dublin Mid-West: This would be a technical gain as the party has no seat here after losing the byelection for Frances Fitzgerald’s former seat. Emer Higgins should safely take one seat out of four and the party might even consider itself in with a shout for a second seat, although that is a long shot.2. Cork North-Central: This is another technical gain as there is a vacant seat. Fine Gael has no seat there since Dara Murphy’s resignation in December. Colm Burke should easily win one seat for the party in the four-seat constituency.3. Tipperary:  The target is seat held by Independent Séamus Healy. Fine Gael has gone out on a limb by picking two new and relatively unknown candidates. It had a full quota in 2016 but terrible vote management and candidate selection lost it its seat. The party’s strong local election performance should provide it with the basis for a seat here at the expense of an Independent. Was it a mistake by Mary Newman Julian not to contest the local elections, unlike her running mate Garret Ahearn? Could they repeat the mistakes of 2016? The mood has darkened considerably here.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Fianna Fáíl already has two and is unlikely to win three. Sinn Féin has traditionally been not as strong in Cavan as in Monaghan. But the surge in the poll now means that Pauline Tully could edge out Fine Gael’s TP O’Reilly for the last seat. This would be a big body blow.5. Cork North-West: The target is a Fianna Fáil seat. A one-point increase needed in vote share compared with 2016. John Paul O’Shea ran as an Independent in 2016 and did well. Now under the Fine Gael banner will run Fianna Fáíl close.6. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. A two percentage-point increase in vote share is required compared with 2016. Again a close battle with Fianna Fáil looked in prospect to topple a precarious Sinn Féin seat. Pa O’Driscoll is based in the northern end of the constituency and while the teacher has a high profile and is a strong campaigner, he might struggle for transfers in the latter counts. On balance, it’s hard to see Sinn Féin not holding the seat, even though the party is not showing as strongly in Munster.7. Dublin-Rathdown: Shane Ross is the target. A five percentage-point increase in vote share required compared with 2016. Neale Richmond will need to put in a huge performance to create one of the shocks of the day by taking out Ross. And now, it is not only Ross but also Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan he has to worry about.8. Kerry: The target is a Sinn Féin seat. A five-point increase is required. The Sinn Féin seat is no longer in such danger. Fine Gael’s candidate Michael Kennelly comes from a well-known Listowel GAA family. Fianna Fáil looks marginally stronger though after the local elections but there is a neater geographical ide between Kennelly and sitting TD Brendan Griffin. May be moot now if Pa Daly can harness all of the Martin Ferris vote.9. Longford-Westmeath: The target is a Labour Party seat. Another ding-dong battle between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for a vulnerable seat, this time the one vacated by Labour’s Willie Penrose. It will boil down to be a bout between two Longford candidates. Fianna Fáíl is stronger in the constituency overall but Fine Gael is stronger in Longford (it won 39 per cent of the vote in last year’s local elections. Its candidate Micheál Carrigy has a high profile. A bellwether constituency. Don’t rule out Sinn Féin.10. Galway East: A five-point gain is required to take a seat off Seán Canney. This will be a local battle, between the outgoing Tuam Independent and Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil rivals from the same area. Fine Gael’s Peter Roche performed strongly in the local elections but Fianna Fáil had a big day in Tuam, taking four out of seven. Again very, very tight. But on opinion poll evidence you would have to favour Fianna Fáil, or even Canney holding.11. Louth: A two-point increase is required. The target is Independent Peter Fitzpatrick. Fine Gael has only one seat here after Fitzpatrick’s resignation from the party in 2018. Dundalk-based councillor John McGahon will be one of five jousting for the last seat and might just come up short.12. Limerick City: The target is a Labour seat. A five-point rise on 2016 is required. Others, Fianna Fáil and the Greens, look stronger in the battle for the final seat with Jan O’Sullivan.1. Dún Laoghaire: to Fianna FáilGreens. A certainty. Fine Gael holds three seats out of four because outgoing ceann comhairle Seán Barrett was automatically returned in 2016. He is not standing this time. The party won 25 per cent of the vote in 2016. Now it’s looking at the dismal scenario of returning only one seat here.2. Dublin North-West: to Fianna Fáíl. Probability is high. Noel Rock is a very doughty campaigner but he is up against it this time. He narrowly saw off Fianna Fáil’s Paul McAuliffe in 2016 but his rival is in a much stronger position now, and Fianna Fáil had a very strong local election here. Sinn Féin has been on the slide here but it would be hard to see Dessie Ellis’s fall being so dramatic as to lose.3. Galway West: to Greens or Fianna Fáil. Probability is medium to high. Like Clare the party managed to retain two seats with only 24 per cent of the vote, and relied heavily on Labour transfers. Its two TDs, Seán Kyne and Hildegarde Naughton, are high profile but would need to increase the party’s share of the vote against parties whose support levels are rising.4. Dublin Bay South: to the Labour Party. Probability low to medium. The second Fine Gael seat could be in play here if Labour’s Kevin Humphreys gains traction. A strong Green performance could also impact. If the  opinion poll for Fine Gael is correct, this might make one of its seats in this “true blue” constituency vulnerable.5. Wexford:  to Independent or Sinn Féin. Paul Kehoe clung on in 2016 will face a challenge again. Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen performed well in the recent byelection and the party is flying in the polls. Verona Murphy’s candidacy could also have an impact on Kehoe.6. Clare: to IndependentFianna Fáíl. The party won less votes than Fianna Fáíl in 2016 but still managed to retain both seats thanks to Labour transfers. Fianna Fáil seems to have a very strong ticket and should win a second seat. The decision by Michael Harty not to run will be a boon to it. Fine Gael’s only vulnerability is losing to another Independent candidate in the shape of Michael McNamara.7. Dublin South-Central: to GreensFianna Fáil. Catherine Byrne has survived here against all the odds but this might be one election too many. Fianna Fáíl looks strong for a seat as do the Greens. Something will have to give and it could be Fine Gael.8. Meath East: to Sinn Féin. Darren O’Rourke was not all that far away in 2016 and will not be all that far away this time either. Many of those who live on the Dublin side of the constituency are commuters who are one of the big groups clamouring for change. Regina Doherty’s seat, in particular, is vulnerable.1. Dún Laoghaire: There is an extra seat. Needs a one per cent increase in vote share compared with the 2016 general election. Last time out this was a three-seater because outgoing Ceann Comhairle Seán Barrett was a TD. Fianna Fáil do have a quota so should pick up a seat. It is running two candidates, Mary Hanafin and Cormac Devlin\u0026nbspand there is a danger they could cancel each other out. The Greens look strong for a seat here.2. Dublin North-West: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Needs a one per cent rise in support from the 2016 general election. Finglas-based Paul McAuliffe topped the poll amid a strong Fianna Fáil performance in the local elections and is current Lord Mayor. Fine Gael’s Noel Rock relied hugely on Labour transfers to pip him last time out and he looks very vulnerable.3. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Needs a five percentage-point increase since 2016: This moves from a three- to four-seat constituency. Mary Fitzpatrick would need to add five points to her 11 per cent showing in 2016 though she performed very strongly in her own electoral area in the local elections. Mary Lou McDonald will top the poll and the Greens also look as if they they may pip Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats.4. Dublin South-Central: One per cent increase required compared with 2016. Target is Independent or People Before Profit seats, or perhaps Fine Gael. Catherine Ardagh lost out by less than 40 votes in 2016. She has had a high profile since as her party’s leader in the Seanad and Fianna Fáil did well in the local elections. Only seat safe here is Sinn Féin and she is an odds-on favourite to regain the seat once held by her late father, Seán Ardagh. Sinn Féin would have won two seats here if it ran two candidates.5. Clare: Target is an Independent or Fine Gael seat. Two percentage-point rise required since 2016: Fine Gael’s second seat here was very vulnerable until Independent Michael Harty announced he would not contest the election. Fianna Fáil seems to have got its formula right. Cathal Crowe is a strong candidate who did himself no harm with his boycott of the proposed Royal Irish Constabulary event. It had five per cent more votes at 30 per cent than Fine Gael in 2016 but won only seat, while its rival won two. It looks as if Fine Gael will be the loser here, with Independent and former Labour TD Michael McNamara and Green Róisín Garvey in the hunt for the fourth seat.6. Galway East: Target is an Independent seat held by Seán Canney: Six percentage-point increase needed compared with 2016: Tuam is going to be the battleground here. Canney is defending a seat he won handily. The other two seats are in the southeastern Loughrea-Portumna axis held by Anne Rabbitte of Fianna Fáil and in the Athenry-GortKinvara southern axis held by Fine Gael’s Ciarán Cannon. The Independent brand around Tuam, so strong from 2014-2016, receded in last year’s local elections. Fine Gael has chosen a strong councillor, Peter Roche who topped the poll in Tuam. But Fianna Fáil won four out of seven council seats in Tuam, and that might give it an edge. It has chosen Cllr Donagh Killilea, a son of the late TD and MEP Mark Killilea. He’s come late into the race though but at this stage he might be ahead of Roche. Don’t underestimate Canney.7. Kerry: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. An eight percentage-point increase needed here from 2016. Sinn Féin was vulnerable but not any more. Fianna Fáil had very good local elections and the addition of Tralee councillor Norma Foley gives it a very strong ticket and may dent the impact Michael Healy-Rae had in the northern part of the constituency in 2016. Norma Moriarty is comfortably placed in the Iveragh Peninsula in the south while sitting TD John Brassil is from Ballyheigue, geographically close to Foley. Fine Gael has a strong Listowel-based councillor Mike Kennelly as its second candidate. But Pa Daly, seen as a beaten docket a month ago, is now back in the frame for Sinn Féin.8. Longford-Westmeath: Target is a Labour seat. Seven percentage-point increase needed from 2016: Fianna Fáil is the largest party in the entire constituency but the last seat may turn out to be a battle between Fianna Fáíl’s Joe Flaherty and Micheál Carrigy for the “Longford” seat, a county in which Fine Gael is stronger. And now Sorca Clarke of Sinn Féin has moved into view.9. Carlow-Kilkenny: The target is a Sinn Féin or Fine Gael seat and a two percentage-point increase is required. Winning three out of five seats is always a massive task and if Fianna Fáíl pulls it off here, it will be well on its way to government. John McGuinness and Bobby Aylward ided the Kilkenny vote very well last time. Sinn Féin’s Kathleen Funchion is no longer vulnerable. Fianna Fáil’s Carlow candidate Jennifer Murnane O’Connor came very close in 2016 and could get over the line this time. But will it be at the expense of Pat Deering of Fine Gael, or of her running mate, Aylward?10. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. Four percentage-point increase required since 2016. Another Sinn Féin TD, Pat Buckley, looked like facing a challenge following a poor local election for the party in Co Cork but now is seen as safe, even though the Sinn Féin vote is not as strong in Munster. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s second candidates had only a handful of votes separating them the last time around. The party’s second candidates are at opposite ends of the constituency. It’s now marginal.11. Laois-Offaly: A Fine Gael seat is the target. A four percentage-point increase in required. It is a Fianna Fáil heartland and Fine Gael’s Marcella Corcoran Kennedy had a middling vote in 2016. However, Fine Gael did well in locals and it would be a tall order for Fianna Fáil to win three out of five here. Brian Stanley of Sinn Féin remains strong in Portlaoise.12. Louth: A Sinn Féin or Independent seat is the target. A nine point increase is needed. Fianna Fáil could have a higher percentage of votes than Fine Gael but might struggle with getting enough transfers to bring the party over the line. Its second candidate, James Byrne, is based in Drogheda where there is already a number of strong candidates. Sinn Féin now looks as if it will hold on to two which would make it a tricky proposition for Byrne to join Declan Breathnach in the Dáíl.13. Kildare South: An extra seat. A four percentage-point increase is required. An effective three-seater because Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl was elected here. Fianna Fáil won two out of three in 2016 when it was actually a three-seater but a taller order this time as Mark Wall of Labour could sneak in. Suzanne Doyle is a high-profile running mate for sitting TD Fiona O’Loughlin and there is potential there. But it’s less straightforward than 2016. Fiona McLoughlin Healy and Cathal Berry are two Independents, one of whom might spring a surprise.14. Dublin South-West: The target is an Independent seat. Fianna Fáil got a quota here in 2016 and would need an eight-point increase in first-preference votes plus good vote management to win a second seat. However, candidate Charlie O’Connor had a mammoth local election in Tallaght and could squeeze through in a big field at the expense of Katherine Zappone or Paul Murphy.15. Dublin Fingal: The target is a Fine Gael seat. A five percentage-point boost is needed. On paper the party has a chance here of taking a second seat after getting 1.4 quotas in 2016. However, the Greens will now need to take it in a scenario where Fine Gael is winning no seats. A very tall order.16. Galway West: A five percentage-point increase is required. Fianna Fáil won more votes here than Fine Gael in 2016 but still returned only one TD. One of the Fine Gael TDs could be vulnerable but the disparity between Eamon Ó Cuív’s votes, and his running mates’ have always been too high. Against that, the party had a good local election in the city, and Ollie Crowe is an experienced candidate. His chances are remote though given the crowded field, and the strengths of other newish candidates such as Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats, Pauline O’Reilly of the Green Party, and (perhaps) Mairéad Farrell of Sinn Féin.17. Limerick City: A Labour Party seat is the target. Fianna Fáil has a strong ticket in Willie O’Dea and James Collins, a cousin of Niall’s. Sinn Féin’s Maurice Quinlivan looked on shaky ground a month ago but no more. Jan O’Sullivan might be more precarious.18. Dublin Rathdown: The target is the Independent Seat. An eight-point increase over 2016 is required. This was going to be the only constituency in the country where Fianna Fáíl had no seat. But in the last week, Shay Brennan has been talked up as a possible challenger for Shane Ross’s seat, which has come as a huge surprise.1. Wicklow: Could miss out to Greens, Social Democrats or Independents. Stephen Donnelly won almost 21 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but as a Social Democrat. With 13 per cent of the vote in 2016, Fianna Fáil would need to add at least 9 per cent to have any chance of taking a second seat. The big unknown is how Donnelly’s vote will be impacted by him being a Fianna Fáil candidate. It will certainly be a negative drag despite his profile as his party’s health spokesman. Valerie Cox’s candidacy will not be a help.3. Sligo-Leitrim: Again Fianna Fáil won two out of four here on 32 per cent of the vote. Fine Gael had a good local election in Sligo but Fianna Fáil is still a little stronger. Marian Harkin’s entry into the race has upset all that planning. If she knocks out a sitting TD, the most likely is one of the two Fianna Fáil deputies. But there is a scenario where Fine Gael – which again messed up its candidate strategy here – could end up with zero seats.4. Kildare North: Could lose to Greens or Labour Party. Fianna Fáil won the second seat here on the back of a lowish first preference. The Green Party candidate, Vincent P Martin, might pose a threat, as might Labourveteran Emmet Stagg. Now Sinn Féin could also be a player here. On balance, it could be a hold, especially if vote management remains as disciplined as it was in 2016.5. Roscommon-Galway: Fianna Fáil is potentially vulnerable to Fine Gael in the only constituency where it has no representation. Fine Gael’s Aisling Dolan is based in Ballinasloe and not widely known in Roscommon. Fine Gael had a poor local election in Roscommon. Besides Denis Naughten is still regarded as proxy Fine Gael. It will be interesting to see if the addition of the high-profile Órla Leyden will affect the dynamic between herself and sitting TD, Eugene Murphy. On balance, a hold.6. Dublin Bay South: Labour poses a threat. Jim O’Callaghan got elected with just over half a quota in 2016. He has been helped by having a high profile but if he fails to add to his first preferences, he might find Labour’s Kevin Humphreys breathing down his neck. He relied a lot on transfers from Chris Andrews of Sinn Féin in 2016 and may not get as many. The absence of Michael McDowell from the slate will help his cause. Very unlikely to lose.1. Donegal: Target is an Independent seat. It needs a one-point increase in vote share over 2016. Pádraig Mac Lochlainn narrowly lost out to Thomas Pringle in 2016 using an ill-advised three-candidate strategy. This time there is just two candidates and the party has high hopes it can win back its second seat. Will be tight though.2. Dublin West: Target is Labour PartyS-PBP. A two percentage point increase needed over 2016. Paul Donnelly has been knocking on the door in Dublin West and was the last remaining unsuccessful candidate in 2016. However, Sinn Féin did not have a great local election but it is in constituencies like this that it has a gale wind behind it. Ruth Coppinger looks in real trouble, as does Labour. A certain win.3. Wexford: Target is Fine Gael. A two-point increase is needed. Another constituency where Sinn Féin came close to winning a seat in 2016. There have been mixed messages this year, a poor local election and a slightly better byelection performance. However, the momentum has returned and Johnny Mythen might be the fit. He is located to the north of the constituency which might be a handicap.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six-point increase is needed. This is one of the few constituencies where Sinn Féin has the potential to win a second seat. Cavan has always been a bit of a challenge for it but this time Pauline Tully is highly experienced and has a chance alongside Matt Carthy.5. Mayo: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Rose Conway-Walsh is an excellent Senator but always seemed to be coming up a little short in Mayo. But the surge in party support will certainly make her a contender here, and if she is ahead of the Greens’ Saoirse McHugh, which is likely, her transfers might push the Sinn Féin candidate over the line.6. Longford-Westmeath: A new planet is discovered in the galaxy. Sorca Clarke was seen as a mid-table finisher until a fortnight ago but now Sinn Féin can challenge in this constituency. I still see the final seat going to either Fianna Fáíl or Fine Gael.1. Dublin Mid-West: to Fine Gael. This was almost certain before the campaign started but the party will now be in the mix to retain its two TDs in this four-seat constituency. Its challenge will be to stay ahead of Gino Kenny, the Greens and Paul Gogarty.2. Louth: to the Labour Party. Possibility is medium to low. The party always had a tall order on its hands retaining two seats in Louth following Gerry Adams’s retirement. And while it won more than 24 per cent of the vote in the local elections, it needs a higher volume of number ones to compensate for lack of transfers. A fortnight ago, I would have said No. Now, I would say it has a good chance of holding.3. Cork East: to Fianna FáilFine Gael. This a bit of long shot. Pat Buckley looked a goner last May after the party bombed in the locals. But it’s bounced back and so has he. While Sinn Féin not showing up as highly in Munster, he can ward off the challenge from Fianna Fáíl and Fine Gael.Other constituencies: I had another eight constituencies marked as potential losses for Sinn Féin. But that was a fortnight ago. And the world has changed since then.1. Louth: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. A two percentage-point increase is needed compared with 2016. Despite coming out of government, Labour very narrowly lost a number of seats and this was one of them. Ged Nash will be buoyed by the party’s strong showing in its stronghold of Drogheda and is in contention to take a seat, although it will be a scrap.2. Dublin Bay North: The party is targeting seats vacated by Independents. A two-point increase in vote share is needed. This constituency is always unpredictable because of the huge number of candidates. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin’s passage to regain a seat is helped hugely by the retirements of Finian McGrath and Tommy Broughan. If he does not win, Labour can pack up and call it a day.3. Kildare South: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six point increase is needed. The addition of a seat will favour Mark Wall to take a position once held by his father, Jack. However, he needs to spread his support beyond his Athy base and may be vulnerable to Fianna Fáil’s Suzanne Doyle, or an asymmetric challenge from two strong Independents.4. Cork North-Central: Target is Solidarity-People Before Profit. Five per cent increase needed compared to 2016 election. Solidarity’s Mick Barry will struggle to recapture 15 per cent of the vote from 2016 but will not lose his seat easily. Labour’s John Maher performed well in the byelections and has established a profile after winning a council seat. Labour has not really recovered fully here after being floored in 2016. Maher may be in contention for the last seat but confidence has ebbed a little since start of campaign.5. Waterford:  Target is an Independent seat. A four-point increase is required. With John Halligan’s resignation, there will be a spare seat here. The big parties each have one seat and Labour looks the best placed of the small parties to benefit, through John Pratt. He will have to fend off Marc Ó Cathasaigh of the Greens who are growing here but also – more immediately – Cllr Matt Shanahan, the Independent who has led the high-profile campaign to improve services at Waterford hospital. Pratt may be behind the curve a little here.6. Dublin South-Central: Target is Fine GaelPeople Before Profit. A four percentage-point boost is needed. Like Dublin Bay North, this constituency will involve a scramble for the last seat. If Labour stays ahead of Greens and other left-leaning candidates, Rebecca Moynihan could come close. She is a very impressive candidate but it’s a slightly long shot.7. Kildare North:  Target is Fianna Fáil. A four-point increase is needed. Veteran Emmet Stagg was not that far away in 2016. He will need to stay ahead of the Greens and then rely on heavy transfers from them. Marginal.8. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat here. A five-point increase is needed. Another veteran Joe Costello is the Labour standard bearer and will be in the mix in the final shake-up. Might not happen this time though. Unlikely.9. Dún Laoghaire: Cllr Juliet O’Connell has had an impressive breakthrough year after getting elected as a councillor last year. She’s still comparatively new though and might suffer a slight profile deficit, given her late entry into the race. It must not be forgotten Labour held a seat here for many years but to win she would really have to dislodge Richard Boyd Barrett, who holds the sole left-wing seat in the constituency. Very slim chance.1. Longford-Westmeath: Potential loss to Fine GaelFianna Fáil. Possibility is high. Willie Penrose is retiring having defied all odds, and laws of gravity, in 2016. It’s hard to see Labour retaining this seat even though former county footballer, Alan Mangan, has a high profile.2. Dublin West: to Green PartySinn Féin. Possibility is high. The Greens look poised to win a seat here, with Fine Gael seeking a second seat, and Sinn Féin is also poised to take a seat at the expense of Ruth Coppinger. Joan Burton held the seat here in 2016 against the odds but you sense the tide might have run out on her.3. Limerick City:  Jan O’Sullivan looked comparatively safe until Sinn Féin managed to get back on the pitch. If Fianna Fáíl gets a second seat here it could be at her expense. She survived in 2016 and she is likely to survive again.1. Dún Laoghaire: Extra seat. A 10-point boost is needed. If the party does not win a seat here, there will be no Green surge. It had a big local election here and should win its first seat in the constituency.2. Dublin West: Target is LabourSolidarity Party. An eight-point increase is required. Green Party chairman Roderic O’Gorman has been its candidate here for some time now and is expected to win a seat on the back of a really strong local election performance by him and colleagues.3. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. An eight-point rise is required. The party was nowhere here in 2016 but again the momentum is with it after the local elections in a constituency where it did particularly well. David Healy won’t get it easy though and will have to fight it out with the Social Democrats, Independent John Lyons, and Labour for two seats.4. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A seven percentage-point increase is needed. The party did well in both local election areas with Ciarán Cuffe topping the poll in the north inner city. Its leader on Dublin City Council Neasa Hourigan is the candidate. She is impressive. She seems slightly ahead of Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats in the race for the final seat.5. Dublin South-West: Target is an Independent seat. An eight-point increase is needed. The party will have an impact on Fine Gael and the Independent Minister Katherine Zappone. It elected councillors comfortably in all the middle-class areas of the constituency and Cllr Francis Noel Duffy (the husband of deputy leader Catherine Martin) is favoured to take a seat.6. Cork South-Central: Target is Sinn Féin. A six point boost is required. Lorna Bogue will need to mount a huge challenge to dislodge Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire for the last seat in a constituency of heavy hitters Micheál Martin, Michael McGrath and Simon Coveney are the other TDs. She is very much on the left of the party and will compete for transfers from smaller groups and left-leaning Independents.7. Wicklow:  Target is Fianna FáilFine Gael. A six-point increase is needed. The party is hardly above five per cent in Wicklow but can benefit from transfers in a constituency where there are always multiple candidates. Fianna Fáil (Stephen Donnelly) and Sinn Féin votes are both expected to drop somewhat and the Green candidate Steven Matthews had an impressive haul of votes in the locals last year. With so many candidates, including Valerie Cox, it might be too big an ask.8. Galway West:  Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A six-point increase in vote share from 2016 is required. Pauline O’Reilly is a strong candidate who will be in the mix after the party had a good local elections in Galway City and in Connemara. The question is how strong the vote will be outside the city. She is also competing against Catherine Connolly for votes who is very strong in the city. There is also the impressive Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats and Sinn Féin’s Mairéad Farrell is now back in the frame. No certainty at all.9. Waterford: Target is an Independent seat. A six-point increase is required. There is a seat for the taking by a smaller party in Waterford with Halligan standing down. Former senator Grace O’Sullivan would have been a strong favourite if she had not run for Europe. Her replacement Marc Ó Cathasaigh will need to battle hard to break through against a strong challenge from Labour and from Matt Shanahan. He might just snatch it.10. Kildare North: Target is Fianna Fáíl. A seven-point increase in vote share is required. A commuter constituency where the Greens made a big breakthrough in the local elections winning three seats on the council. Naas-based Vincent P Martin, brother of deputy leader Catherine Martin, is a smooth campaigner and will give Fianna Fáíl a run for its money in the battle for the last seat.11. Louth: Target is Independent. A five-point increase of vote share is required. There were high hopes a decade ago that Mark Dearey might make a breakthrough for the Greens here. The former senator is a popular figure but would need to double the party’s vote in the constituency.12. Clare: This is another constituency which has seen a candidate or party emerge out of nowhere. There’s definitely a seat for an Independent or smaller party here following the retirement of Michael Harty. Róisín Garvey is a straight-talking west Clare woman who has made a big impact and will be vying with Michael McNamara for that seat.1. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A one-point increase is needed. Gary Gannon changed local electoral areas in the locals and was comfortably elected. He came very close in 2016, enjoys a high profile and will be in a battle with the Greens, Fianna Fáil and Labour for one of the final two seats here.2. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependents. Another very solid Social Democrats performer is Cian O’Callaghan. The forward momentum of the Greens and John Lyons might stymie his chances though.3. Galway West: Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A five-point increase in vote share required. Niall Ó Tuathail was another Social Democrats’ star in 2016 with a strong showing in Galway West. Has he maintained the progress? Some would consider it ill advised for him not to have contested the local election. Council seats are seen as springboards for national politics. Still in with a strong chance.4. Wicklow: Target is Fianna Fáil. Jennifer Whitmore had a very good local election and topped the poll in Greystones, Donnelly’s stomping ground. He got 20 per cent last time when he ran for the Social Democrats. But a lot of that was a personal vote. Wicklow can be very unpredictable. Nobody knows how well Donnelly will do flying under the Fianna Fáil banner. Valerie Cox is an unknown quantity. Whitmore could very well be in contention for the final seat if she manages to capitalise on her local election performance.1. Cork North-Central: to Labour Party. Mick Barry had 15 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but the signs in the local elections, and in the recent byelection, were ominous. He is going to struggle but his vote will certainly be higher than the locals suggested. Facing threats from Labour and, possibly, the Greens.2. Dublin South-Central: to Fianna Fáil. Bríd Smith won with only a handful of votes to spare in 2016 and could be vulnerable this time to Fianna Fáil, the Greens, the Social Democrats and Labour. Some see this as a battle between her and Joan Collins in that left-wing space, even though both are based in different parts of the constituency.3. Dubin Mid-West: to IndependentGreens or Sinn Féin. Gino Kenny came from nowhere to win a seat in 2016 and this popular and sincere TD might just hang on, partly on the back of his championing medicinal cannabis, which has given him a national profile. There are two left-wing seats in the constituency, and Sinn Féin is now looking to win a second. Another threat will come from an Independent candidate, possibly Paul Gogarty.4. Dublin West: Vulnerable to Sinn Féin. Ruth Coppinger has been an indefatigable worker and has a national profile. But so do the other TDs, Leo Varadkar, Burton and Jack Chambers. Her seat is under huge threat.5. Dún Laoghaire: To Fianna Fáil or the Greens. There has always been a left-wing seat in this constituency, and Richard Boyd Barrett might just hold on to it. However, that would mean getting in ahead of one of the two big parties, or the Greens.6. Dublin South-West: to Fianna Fail or Greens. It’s very hard to predict how Paul Murphy will fare, in his new role as the sole Rise TD in the Dáil. He did very well in 2016 on the back of the water protests but might find it difficult to maintain his support levels in the constituency. The decision by Solidarity to run Sandra Fay against her former party colleagues sounds ludicrous and could have an adverse impact on him. Both are running under the S-PBP banner.1. Dublin Mid-West (Paul Gogarty): Target is People Before Profit. Gogarty could take the fourth seat on the back of a reasonably good outing in the byelection.2. Sligo-Leitrim (Marian Harkin): Target is Fianna Fáil. The former MEP and TD has a very big cachet in the constituency and was wooed by Fine Gael. That offer might play a bit against her but she will be a threat to Fianna Fáíl.3. Wexford (Verona Murphy): Target is Fine Gael. Murphy is as well-known as she is controversial and early in the campaign was seen poised to take a seat at the expense of Paul Kehoe. However, Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen might top the poll and that might put paid to her chances.4. Clare (Michael McNamara): Target is IndependentFine Gael. There is an outgoing Independent TD, Michael Harty, who is retiring. Clare has a tradition of electing Independents and it might prove lucky for the former Labour Party TD.5. Waterford (Matt Shanahan): The “hospital candidate” has a very high profile locally and loss of hospital services is always a touchstone issue. Shanahan is in with a chance and will be vying with the Greens and Labour for the final seat.5. Dublin Bay North (John Lyons): The former People Before Profit councillor has an excellent track record on Dublin City Council and could cause an upset here against one of the three smaller left-leaning parties vying for the final seat.1. Laois-Offaly (Carol Nolan): Laois and Offaly were two separate three-seat constituencies in 2016. Now, it’s a five-seater and former Sinn Féin TD Carol Nolan could be the obvious loser.2. Tipperary (Seamus Healy): to Fine Gael. Healy has been a great survivor but a change of mood might see him struggle.3. Donegal (Thomas Pringle): to Sinn Féin. Pringle has also been a solid vote-getter but Sinn Féin has been working really hard since 2016 to regain a seat.4. Galway East (Seán Canney): to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Canney is a Minister of State and a hard constituency worker but will find it hard to resist the two bigger parties. His best hope is to stay ahead of their Tuam-based candidates.5. Dublin South-West (Katherine Zappone): to GreensFianna Fáil.Very hard to gauge how the Minister for Children will do. She benefitted from anti-establishment transfers in 2016 but may be able to trade on her performance as Minister with another set of voters.6. Dublin Rathdown (Shane Ross): to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil: This is a very fickle constituency and this year’s poll topper is next year’s also-ran. Ross’s star has been waning here and his is under strong pressure from Neale Richmond and (surprisingly) Shay Brennan. However, he seems a little stronger now than at this time last year, having considerably upped his performance as Minister.8. Louth (Peter Fitzpatrick): to Fine Gael. It’s hard to know how the Independent TD, formerly of Fine Gael, will do without a party banner. He is the chairman of Louth GAA this year and that is always a boon. But there are some very big hitters among his rivals and it will be difficult for him to survive.Harry McGee is political correspondent with The The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4163924.1580997828!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"left parties should not squander support in coalition boyd barrett","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople Before Profit press conference. Richard Boyd Barrett, Brid Smith, Paul Murphy and Gino Kenny. Photograph Nick BradshawRichard Boyd Barrett, who is seeking to retain his seat in Dún Laoghaire, said the “disastrous mistakes” of the Labour Party and the Greens in entering government with Fine Gael of Fianna Fáil “must not be made again.”Speaking at the radical left wing grouping’s final press conference of the election campaign outside Leinster House, Boyd Barrett said the party was “appealing for an absolutely huge turnout” from voters. “We’re also appealing for other parties of the left to have the same courage and ambition as is clearly being expressed by people on the doorsteps for a breaking of the cycle of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael rule, and to stay left,” he said. Boyd Barrett called on Sinn Féin and other smaller centre left parties not to “squander this historic opportunity” by supporting either of the traditional centre right parties in forming a government after the election. “We will keep pressure on other parties to keep moving left, to stay left … The best guarantee to keep the other left parties honest is to vote People Before Profit - Solidarity, and keep that momentum for change going,” he said. Paul Murphy of Rise party, who is standing in Dublin South West under the PBP-Sol banner, said the grouping was in a position to hold its six seats.“If you do the maths Sinn Féin have 42 candidates in this election, in order to have a Dáil majority you need to have 80 TDs plus. “If there is to be an alternative government formed, one that excludes Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, well then a whole number of candidates from Solidarity - People Before Profit and other principled lefts need to be elected,” Murphy said. The left wing grouping were the only ones who would use their Dáil seats to “block the return of any government involving Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael,” he said. “It’s like a Repeal moment only it’s much more exciting in a way, because everywhere you go people are talking politics and young people are very much engaged in the political agenda,” she said.

The West Belfast MLA was in Magennis’s bar in central Belfast the night in January 2005 when Robert McCartney was stabbed and beaten to death. Photograph: PAThe latest fallout from the Paul Quinn murder may make it problematic over whether such a liaison could happen but it is worth examining how Sinn Féin has acquitted itself in the Northern Executive – when it was sitting.There is no escaping the fact that Sinn Féin’s links to the IRA and also to what some have described as “unelected backroom figures” has frequently made government in the North difficult, and sometimes impossible.Between December 1999 and October 2002, the Executive was suspended four times, with Sinn Féin central to those breakdowns, first over the IRA’s failure to fully decommission and over “Stormontgate” in 2002, an alleged IRA spy ring operating at the heart of government.It took another five years until the Executive and Assembly were up and running again. That Executive, with the DUP and Sinn Féin in charge, lasted nearly to 10 years but collapsed in January 2017, again with Sinn Féin in the spotlight. Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in a row over the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme, bringing down the administration,It took three years to build it up again.Decommissioning won’t be, and spying shouldn’t be, relevant to any Dáil coalition involving Sinn Féin. But there is still the old question of who pulls the strings.A senior Stormont ex-civil servant who worked with many ministers from across the political ide said that in the initial years of the Executive and for quite a period thereafter, much of what Sinn Féin was doing at ministerial level “seemed to be constantly referred back to Connolly House (the party’s HQ on the Andersonstown Road in west Belfast) to be washed through a committee system there.“There was that smell of former combatants still having a huge impact on the whole thing,” he said. “No matter what policy paper was put forward it tended to find its way back to Connolly House.”That most recently came to the fore in the row over the RHI scheme, dubbed “cash for ash”.Although three senior civil servants by then had told him the cost-saving plan was legitimate, Ó Muilleoir still consulted with Howell to ensure he was content with the proposal. He was, and the minister approved the scheme the following day.Howell, a Belfast man who is in his early 70s, keeps a low profile, but Ed Moloney, author of A secret history of the IRA, has described him as “a reticent but enormously influential activist who doubled as chairman of the party’s think tank, the body that directed the peace process for the SF leadership”.Moloney also portrayed him as Gerry Adams’s “most trusted adviser and counsellor” and “a highly secretive figure” who was “arguably one of the most influential figures in the Provisionals”.Sinn Féin also has other backroom people with senior IRA pedigrees who appear to wield considerable influence. They include Padraic Wilson and Martin Lynch, whom Ó Muilleoir also consulted about RHI, and Sean “Spike” Murray and Bobby Storey.The incident with Ó Muilleoir and Howell caused political upset but no great surprise in Northern Ireland because politics is done differently there.But would a coalition in the Dáil survive if it emerged that Sinn Féin ministers were refusing to sign off on particular proposals until they had clearance from unelected veteran IRA figures?Pressing for unityFor example, Mary Lou McDonald said in August 2018 that pressing for unity against the turbulence of Brexit would be unwise. But he following day she retreated, saying she wanted a Border poll and the sooner the better.The accusation by unionists and others was that she was got at by the Belfast brigade, so to speak, and instructed to change her tune. Any repetition of claims that she is a mouthpiece for shadowy sources could cause problems if she were in a coalition government.In all, Sinn Féin has had 11 ministers in various Executives. Leaving the sinister stuff aside, they performed no better and no worse than you would expect from ministers working in, say, the Dublin cabinet.McGuinness is generally regarded as by far the most imposing and impressive of them. He worked well with Ian Paisley snr – the pair of them were dubbed the Chuckle Brothers – with the DUP leader viewing his Sinn Féin colleague as something of a prodigal son. The relationship with Paisley’s successor Peter Robinson, the great pragmatist, also was reasonably productive. They had major rows but somehow managed to surmount most of the obstacles.Some, such as the abandoned proposed peace and reconciliation centre at the Maze site, they couldn’t solve, leaving a festering wound that also contributed to the collapse of Stormont three years ago.As health minister, Bairbre de Brún faced rows over the proposed rationalisation of the health service and the downgrading of a number of hospitals . But before she could get anything major done matters were taken out of her hands with the collapse of Stormont in 2002.Michelle Gildernew was one of the most popular agriculture ministers with, to quote one source, “some of the uber Prods in the Ulster Farmers’ Union describing her as ‘our minister’.”Current Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill was criticised over the RHI scandal after it emerged that when she was agriculture minister, her department organised scores of workshops for farmers to highlight the scheme’s benefits. She insisted the DUP solely was to blame.As health minister in 2016, she was more sure-footed when she introduced the Bengoa report, a radical plan to transform the health system in Northern Ireland. But because of the paralysis of the last three years, it never really achieved lift-off.No Martin McGuinnessO’Neill is no Martin McGuinness but there is a sense of her growing into the job. The sceptics might see it as “just for the optics” but she appears to have developed a businesslike and relatively cordial relationship with First Minister Arlene Foster, which is important if the new administration is to succeed.Newry and Armagh MLA Conor Murphy is at the centre of the current storm over the Paul Quinn murder. But as finance minister it must be said he carries authority and presence in the Executive.He had some other problems, however. As regional development minister his department lost a costly high-profile discrimination case after he appointed a Catholic as chairman of Northern Ireland Water ahead of four Protestant candidates. Sinn Féin also lost an £80,000 libel case in relation to a director of Northern Ireland Water who Murphy sacked.Newly appointed Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey barely had her feet under the desk before Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was complaining about her appointment. The West Belfast MLA was in Magennis’s bar in central Belfast the night in January 2005 when Robert McCartney was stabbed and beaten to death.Martin said the appointment of Hargey – who claimed she saw nothing of the incident and had co-operated with the police investigation – showed Sinn Féin had no “real contrition” for the killing.While these incidents often put Sinn Féin ministers in the headlines for the wrong reasons, the Executive functioned tolerably well, when it was sitting. But there was a feeling that a lot more could have been done.Northern Ireland is still transitioning from the past and that continues to thwart useful politics.The “peace walls” remain up because the dangers and isions that created them haven’t gone away, you know.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Politics latest news: Boris Johnson to nominate Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond for peeragesComment: Reforming the undemocratic House of Lords is the next step in the Brexit projectCoronavirus in the UK: Third patient tests positive for deadly illnessComment: At least Richard Burgon actually believes in mad, far-Left Corbynism.

The gay, half Indian medical doctor was the changing face of modern Ireland.A year after taking office he oversaw the abolition of strict abortion laws and on the international stage he bravely stood up to the British over Brexit. All the while, the economy boomed.But as Ireland heads towards an election this Saturday the 41-year-old progressive -  often mentioned in the same breath as Justin Trudeau in Canada, Emmanuel Macron in France and Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand - is facing defeat.While success on the international stage has won him plaudits, critics at home claim that Mr Varadkar has become arrogant, aloof and not interested in key domestic issues, like healthcare and housing.In Dublin’ cranes swing overhead and the streets are clogged by the movement of hundreds of construction workers employed at what is supposed to be Ireland\u0027s state-of-the-art National Children’s Hospital.Part of a key pledge by Mr Varadkar\u0027s Fine Gael party to fix Ireland\u0027s broken healthcare system, the facility was supposed to open this year for a cost of €650 million.Three years behind schedule and with costs spiralling into the billions, the hospital is one of the reasons that the sheen has come off Mr Varadkar’s premiership.The debacle at the National Children’s Hospital is symptomatic of chaos across the healthcare sector.Hospital waiting lists have reached record levels. There is also a chronic shortage of housing. Young people are unable to get on the housing ladder and quite often cannot afford spiralling rents in Dublin and other cities.Homelessness has also become a major campaign issue. Last year, a photo of a young boy eating his evening meal on a pedestrianised shopping street in the centre of Dublin captured the human cost of the unfolding crisis.In the working class area around the proposed children’s hospital, there is anger at the escalating cost of the project.Maureen O’Mahony, 74, says her main concerns are “jobs for my grandchildren and somewhere they can live”. She used to vote for the Labour Party, but on Saturday she is thinking of going with Sinn Fein or the hard Left.Maureen\u0027s wider constituency is rapidly gentrifying. Cian O’Riordan, 28, a computer science graduate who works in an IT start-up in the area should be the young millennial that fits the mould as a Varadkar voter.Angry about being squeezed out of the housing market by rapidly rising prices, he says he hasn’t made up his mind yet what way he will vote - except that it definitely won’t be for Fine Gael.It has become a rubric of all elections that they are won or lost based on the state of the economy. This is clearly not the case in Ireland.When Fine Gael came to power in 2011 Ireland was in an EU-IMF bailout programme following a spectacular property market crash unemployment was more than 15 per cent, and the national debt had ballooned from 25 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 123 per cent in the space of four years. Also, in 2011, the budget deficit hit 32 per cent of GDP following the rescue of the banking system.Ireland has been the fastest growing economy in the EU for the past six years. Unemployment is at a thirteen year low of 4.8 per cent, national debt is 63.6 per cent of GDP and there was a budget surplus of just under 1 per cent for last year.Mr Varadkar’s handling of Brexit negotiations helped push his popularity to record levels. His implacable resistance to any border on the island of Ireland risked becoming the gordian knot of talks to secure a Withdrawal Agreement. In the end he prevailed.But the Withdrawal Bill was agreed last October. If a week is a long time in politics, then three months is an eternity.Fine Gael traditionally draws its support from urban middle class voters and farmers. But its appeal to these voters has ebbed in recent months. The failure to roll out broadband has provoked a backlash from rural Ireland. The government has also clashed with farmers over beef prices. And even the middle classes are not immune to problems in the housing and health sectors.“On paper the Fine Gael-led Government has done well on key economic indicators,” Eoin O’Malley, professor of politics at Dublin City University, says. “But people have greater expectations of government now, and the housing policy has failed - or it has not succeeded quickly enough. The rent crisis is real and felt by a whole generation.” Mr O’Malley says the other problem for Fine Gael is that it’s been in government for nine years.In a poll released on Monday, Fine Gael was in third place on a rating of 20 per cent, behind Fianna Fail on 23 per cent and Sinn Fein on 25 per cent. If these support levels pan out on election day, then Fine Gael faces a meltdown at the polls.Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have given Sinn Fein a boost, in part by cosying up to other parties such as the Greens as potential coalition partners, Mr O’Malley says. “They’ve taken the edginess off the Greens, and so a vote for other ‘protest’ parties doesn’t look like change, only Sinn Fein does. So I’m not sure we can say Sinn Fein has run a terribly good election, it just became the party to vote for if you are sick of the other lot.”Unless Fine Gael has a Lazarus type recovery in the final days of the campaign before voters go to the polls on Saturday, then Leo Varadkar will be heading to the opposition benches. That is unless Fianna Fail and Fine Gael set aside their historical enmities and form a grand coalition for the first time in the history of the state.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/27/13/Greta-Thunberg.jpg","title":"children climate change parents sustainable family greta thunberg","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.After pledging to become a more sustainable parent, I wasn’t expecting one common response: I shouldn’t have had a child in the first placeAhh, nothing like some words of encouragement to help you achieve a new year’s resolution, is there? Some moral support, if you will some assurance that, yes, you can do this, you absolute hero.So, I was naturally delighted with the online response to my first 2020 pledge blog. In it, I’d outlined plans to become a more sustainable parent in a bid to do my bit for the environment.“Best way to help the planet,” noted one cheerful commenter almost immediately upon publication, “is to have no children.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“By producing another human being,” came another, “you are making the climate change emergency worse. We need to have forced surgical sterilisation to bring the population to manageable levels.”They weren’t alone, either. Of five online contributions, four essentially told me I was selfish for having a child in the first place. A fifth lampooned my name and appearance.Well, gee, THANKS, LADS! Aren’t you quite the inspiring bunch? Forgive me for being so selfish.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

Whatabout-ery, I think they call it.Sure, you might have sold your car but what about the fact you went on holiday abroad last year? Sure, you might eat only vegan but what about the fact you use a gas oven to cook? Sure, you might, while still a teenager, have single-handedly inspired your entire generation to rise up and put climate change on the global agenda — but what about the fact you allowed yourself to be interviewed by a BBC journalist who took a flight to conduct it?All fair questions perhaps but, then, I can do a bit of whatabout-ery myself.I’m promising to be a more sustainable parent to save the planetThat is to say: unless the people who ask these questions live in electric-less, hand-woven wigwams, eat only foraged plants and drink nowt but stream water, what about them slinging their hooks and letting the rest of us do our bit in the rational, everyday way we can? What about that, fellas?There is a serious point here. Such criticism — with its purer-than-thou platitudes and virtue-signalling standpoints — is the quickest way to achieve mass turn-off, when, in fact, dealing with the climate crisis is absolutely dependent on mass buy-in. Indeed, dependent on a million people like you and I making the small changes that will ultimately equate to huge differences.Which is why, despite being a monster who brought a resource-guzzling, air-polluting, land-filling person into the world, I’m still going to try and, you know, recycle a bit more, maybe use the car a bit less, eat a bit of veggie here and there.

That means we don’t use single-use plastic, for example. We try not to buy any new plastic at all in fact, including synthetic material. There isn’t a single bin in our house.\u0026nbspAt first, with two very young children and both of us working full time, the shift felt extreme. Sometimes it still does.\u0026nbspWe don’t bother with supermarkets, corner shops or service stations anymore because everything is wrapped in plastic. We buy our food in jars, metal containers and bags we take with us to shops where we weigh out what we need. Overnight we stopped buying any pre-prepared food and most takeaways, everything is cooked from absolute scratch.\u0026nbspIn the bathroom, we switched to soap from shower gels and bottled shampoo, our toothbrushes are bamboo, my son wears reusable nappies (a revelation as it turned out) and we make our own cleaning products (easier and more effective than I expected).If we buy things for our home, they are secondhand and made from natural materials if at all possible, including clothes, furniture, electrical appliances if we can’t fix what we have or borrow something, DIY materials like paint, you name it.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

We now do it a better way, I believe, for my family’s health, my children’s future and the local, national and global environment they will still be calling home long after I’m food for worms.\u0026nbspTaking matters into our own hands has been empowering to the point of intoxicating. It has helped curb a fair bit of eco-anxiety, we’ve lost a few pounds and, contrary to popular belief, it has already saved us a small fortune.\u0026nbspUpping the ante on our waste has also refocused our minds on other damaging aspects of our modern life, so we don’t fly anymore, our diet is increasingly plant-based and our car is electric.

It’s normal, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be because it’s normal. We’ve got over the hurdles of our first zero waste Christmas, holiday, birthday party. This is how it is going to be, how we believe it needs to be for the rest of our lives.\u0026nbspOur families and friends, work colleagues and schoolmates have stopped assuming this is a phase, or just ignoring our wishes, and have started asking for support as they cut down waste themselves.\u0026nbspWhy eating with the seasons in January is harder than it soundsAnd yet at the back of my head I’ve got doubts. I can’t shake the idea that I’m kidding myself over what we’re really achieving with all this.\u0026nbspIt’s not that we’re too insignificant to make a difference. We get that thrown at us a lot, mostly from people who somehow think our lifestyle decisions are all about judging them and get defensive.I obviously don’t agree anyway. I have two tiny children and I refuse to believe that I can’t help protect their future. My usual response is “It’s only one plastic bag, said 7 billion people”. I think I stole it off Instagram or something.\u0026nbspNo, my nagging doubt is about what truths I might find if I dig a bit deeper.\u0026nbspTake something simple, like recycling. Most of the nation does it in some way. Ours is almost exclusively metal and glass, and there’s a lot less of it than there used to be.\u0026nbspBut I know the recycling process requires transport, energy to transform the material and more energy to reintroduce the renewed item back into the consuming system. Should we be “zero recycling” too?And, if you start thinking about it, what about the environmental impact of the restaurants we go? The places we stay away from home? How our friends make the food we eat when we visit? If I really want to see this through, should I be asking our local café what they have had to throw in the bin to make me that sandwich? If they have, should I stop using it? Should I stop supporting my local economy, adding to the risk that it closes and people who live in my little town have to start driving miles for a cuppa and a cake?\u0026nbspWhat about all the non-physical consuming I do? What’s the carbon impact of the email I’ll send my editor about this blog post?If I pursue zero waste to its limits, will I ultimately find that there are almost no services I can use? Will a truly zero waste life effectively mean dropping out of society? And if so, which compromise is one too far? Where do I draw the line between looking after the environment and looking after my family and myself? How much effort am I willing to make and at what cost?Because these last two are the questions I suspect we’re all asking about our environmental responsibilities right now, here’s my 2020 pledge. I’m going to up my game, I’m going to go for true zero waste to see what that really means.I’ll review the decisions that have got our family to where we are now, do the research on our real life impact and then take it to extremes to find out what is possible for your average household.\u0026nbspSo, as I say, I’m not sure this is a great idea.\u0026nbspBut I have to try.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell.

(AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape.

And then it suddenly stopped.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat rapid and unexplained death has puzzled astronomers, who say the vast galaxy does not fit with our existing models of the early universe.Even before the universe was 2 billion years old,\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbsphad already formed a mass of more than 300 billion suns, making it an\u0026nbspultramassive\u0026nbspgalaxy, said Benjamin Forrest, the lead author of the study, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It challenges our models of how the early universe exists, they say, and could lead to dramatic changes in our understanding of how stars form – and stop forming.Nasa to add ‘hotel’ capsule to International Space StationIn this epoch, very few galaxies have stopped forming stars, and none are as massive as\u0026nbspXMM-2599, said Gillian Wilson, a professor of physics and astronomy at University of California - Riverside, where the research was conducted.The mere existence of\u0026nbspultramassive\u0026nbspgalaxies like\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbspproves quite a challenge to numerical models. Even though such massive galaxies are incredibly rare at this epoch, the models do predict them. The predicted galaxies, however, are expected to be actively forming stars.What makes\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbspso interesting, unusual, and surprising is that it is no longer forming stars, perhaps because it stopped getting fuel or its black hole began to turn on. Our results call for changes in how models turn off star formation in early galaxies.At its peak, the galaxy was forming stars equivalent to\u0026nbspmore than 1,000 of our own suns each year. That is incredibly fast for any galaxy, with our Milky Way forming about one star each year.Because the galaxy is so far away, it has been spotted from a time when the universe was very young. That means that by the present day it could have become something altogether different, and likely equally spectacular.We have caught\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbspin its inactive phase, Wilson said. We do not know what it will turn into by the present day.We know it cannot lose mass. An interesting question is what happens around it. As time goes by, could it gravitationally attract nearby star-forming galaxies and become a bright city of galaxies?Now the team behind the discovery hopes to use the high-tech equipment at the Keck Observatory to delve more into the galaxy, and hopefully answer the questions thrown up by the bizarre clump of stars.We identified\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbspas an interesting candidate with imaging alone, said co-author\u0026nbspMarianna\u0026nbspAnnunziatella, a postdoctoral researcher at Tufts University. We used Keck to better\u0026nbspcharacterize\u0026nbspand confirm its nature and help us understand how monster galaxies form and die.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The road will remain closed for a short time while the vehicle is recovered. Local people and motorists are thanked for their patience.”Footage posted on Twitter showed a police robot taking items from a car parked on the pavement shortly before police gave the all-clear.Earlier, crowds of people had streamed out of offices as police evacuated buildings in the area.Trains stopped calling at East Croydon for two hours and operator Southern said disruption was likely to continue until later in the day.

That has brought major breakthroughs as researchers have looked more deeply and in more detail at the universe than ever before.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut researchers continue to run up against the problem of dark matter and dark energy, which makes up most of the universe but can only be observed indirectly. Nobody has been able to understand its nature or how it fits into any possible model of the cosmos.Some scientists have hoped to move towards solving this problem with a greater understanding of the structure of the universe. If astronomers are able to understand how our cosmos is made up – generating a full picture of the filaments where galaxies cluster together, and the voids that appear to be empty – then they may be able to give a better picture of what it is made of, and how it works.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

If they were able to build a picture of that journey, it could help iluminate the mystery of dark matter and dark energy.Now a team of scientists has built a new tool called the Dark Emulator, described in a recently published paper in the Astrophysical Journal. They hope it could use artificial intelligence to shed more light on how that structure came about.The technology was built by scientists who used supercomputers belonging to the\u0026nbspNational Astronomical Observatory of Japan. They were able to use that emulator on data taken from many of the world\u0027s largest surveys of the sky, allowing them to examine how the cosmic structures of our universe could have been formed.We built an extraordinarily large database using a supercomputer, which took us three years to finish, but now we can recreate it on a laptop in a matter of seconds. I feel like there is great potential in data science, said lead author\u0026nbspTakahiro\u0026nbsp​Nishimichi\u0026nbspin a statement.Using this result, I hope we can work our way towards uncovering the greatest mystery of modern physics, which is to uncover what dark energy is. I also think this method we\u0027ve developed will be useful in other fields such as natural sciences or social sciences.The tool works by relying on machine learning to create hundreds of virtual universes. They were able to alter important parts of the universe, and generate a picture of how they might have changed the cosmos.The Dark Emulator is able to learn from each of those simulations, allowing it to guess how changes in those characteristics would affect the results. That means it does not need to create entirely new simulations, allowing it to generate another virtual universe far more quickly than ever before.In the paper describing the findings, the researchers describe how it was able to accurately predict specific effects in their virtual universes in just seconds. Similar simulations would take days without using the Dark Emulator, they say.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is unclear how many of those are affected, but the problem does not appear to be present on all Windows 10 computers.The issue appears to be a consequence of the fact that the search bar connects to Microsoft\u0027s online services, despite being used to search the local computer. When people search, the computer communicates with Microsoft search engine Bing, and many have suggested a problem in that connection could be the cause of the problem.Microsoft will pay up to $20,000 to people who find problems with XboxReddit users – large numbers of whom have reported the issue in recent hours – have found a workaround for the issue. Many suggest that following the steps involved does fix the problem.But it involves making changes to the computer\u0027s registry, which can cause problems for the PC and in extreme cases cause it to break entirely, and so that fix is not recommended.The problems come just days after Microsoft Teams – the company\u0027s online service for office workers to collaborate – went down.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was actually close to repossession at the time.They were going to repossess my home. So I dug myself out of that one.”Ronnie, who now lives in Bristol, told how he planned on never selling his prized honour.He said: It was something I said I would never, ever do. I am so proud and honoured to have done such a thing and be involved in it that I would never, ever sell it.I have always believed from that day on that the le of a member of the royal family was more valid and important that mine.I still considered it was well worth my while getting shot as opposed to Princess Anne.What I would like is whoever does eventually buy the medal, I would hope they might invite me somewhere to tell them an after-dinner story about what happened on the night.The medal - which will be auctioned off at Dix Noonan Webb in central London next month - is expected to sell for between £, and £,.Princess Anne was just -years-old when she was almost abducted in .The princess was in chauffeur-driven limo - with her then-husband Captain Phillips - driving down the Mall to the palace, when a car swerved in front of them.An armed and masked man, Ian Ball, shot at Annes car as royal police protection officer James Beaton and driver Alex Callender got out of the car tofire.During the attack James’s weapon jammed and Ball shot him three times.Alex was also shot in an attempt to disarm Ball, along with journalist Brian McConnell who tried to intervene.The attacker then got in Annes limo and told her to get out - but the Queen’s only daughter gave a ballsy response. She replied: Not bloody likely.Eventually, Anne did actually get out, with Ian following close behind.However, he was then punched by passerby Mr Russell, and police were able to arrest him.Ball had planned to abduct the princess and demand £m ransom from the Queen, but ended up being sentenced to le in prison and detained in a mental hospital.Recounting the attempted abduction, Mr Russell said: It was very fast moving but it is as clear to me now as it was the day it happened.I punched him twice. The first time was when I got out of my vehicle and I thought it was a road rage incident.He shot PC Hills and I went to hit him around the back of the head, and he turned and shot at me and it went through the windscreen of a taxi.And he praised Princess Anne for her bravery.He said: She was very, very together, telling him, Just go away and dont be such a silly man.He stood there glaring at me with the gun and I hit him. I hit him as hard as I could -he had been a tree he would have fallen over - and he was flat on the floor face down.PC Edmonds then ed on top of him and he was arrested.Auctioneer Oliver Pepys, from Dix Noonan Webb, said: We have sold several George Medals in the past but most have been linked to the Blitz and bomb disposal in the Second World War, so to be offering this peacetime medal, with such a cracking story, is a huge honour.A wide iety of gallantry medals were given to the Magnicent Seven after the event but to my knowledge this is the first to come to auction.It is expected to be sold with other items including a telegram from Princess Anne and a letter from the Met Commissioner.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What is the future of the BBC  Should China build our telecoms network Seldom has the political news agenda been so packed. But what is the story gaining traction at Westminster  For the latest, let’s go straight to our correspondent outside  Downing Street - who, oh dear, is stomping away in protest like Dick Emery’s Honky Tonks, having just had a blazing row with Boris Johnson’s media strategist.Yes, the big story, crazily, is the stand-off between political journalists and the PM’s media advisers. The reporters, hardly the most delicate bunch of dahlias, are wailing that the Government is being beastly to them.In the blue corner we have Downing Street’s press officers who, in an unusual interpretation of the Trade Description Act, are refusing to speak to the Press. When newspapers write about themselves, readers are entitled to roll their eyes.Political news, like the mass-production of pork bangers, is a manufacturing process best conducted away from the view of consumers. Not unless you want to turn the whole country vegan.I’ve been in newspapers since the mid-s, much of the time at Westminster, and have met drunkards, liars, gropers, cheats — and that was just the religious-affairs writers. Don’t let’s pretend journalism or politics attracts innocent hayseeds. Which makes the over-reacting on both sides of the ide in recent days so ridiculous.Creative tension between reporters and politicians’ media handlers is a healthy thing, but the system has suddenly snapped. This follows a general election in which it sometimes felt as though the media, particularly broadcasters, niggled Boris Johnson more effectively than Jeremy Corbyn did.When Boris won a thumping majority, his aides may have thought: “Right, now we can exact revenge on our media tormentors.” If so, they are foolish and unprofessional.First, they started mucking about with the daily briefings to the Westminster press lobby, the club of accredited journalists who report on politics.Then, on Monday, they tried to bar some members of that lobby from a briefing by David Frost, Boris’s main adviser on the European trade negotiations. Some scribes were told they could attend, others were told they were barred.Downing Street claimed that the briefing was too specialised for general politics writers to appreciate. The reporters took a dferent view.They reckoned Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and his sidekick Lee Cain were trying to ide and rule, and to winnow out the journalistic troublemakers. In a rare moment of solidarity among hacks, the newshounds upped and left. Walkout!This squabble is now headline news. Urgent questions were raised in the Commons and many papers and broadcasters are protesting that the Government is trying to censor the free Press in a “sinister” way.They compare this tactic to Donald Trump’s denunciation of mainstream US media for spreading “fake news” . Sir Keir Starmer, would-be leader of the Labour Party, joined the outcry, siding with the journalists. We could have done without that slippery little bit of opportunism.The same Starmer boasted recently that he would refuse to talk to reporters from The Sun, presumably because this paper is not in his pocket.Attempts to neutralise awkward reporters are not exactly new. During the  election, as a scurvy political sketch writer, I was locked out of a Tony Blair campaign event in The Wrekin.Gordon Brown’s people stopped me attending a media event with the president of South Africa.Tory party cronies barred me from witnessing a leadership debate between David Cameron and David Davis in . In the last election, non-sympathetic journalists were not given access to Jeremy Corbyn’s battle bus. Mind you, we were lucky. As one Leftie reporter told me: “You couldn’t get on Corbyn’s bus but I couldn’t get OFF it!”Despite some of those historic precedents, the current “lobby war” is more problematic because it looks more concerted and because it comes at a time when traditional news sources are under challenge from the internet.Online news sites can be shady and unreliable. Traditional lobby journalists, for all their faults, are at least reasonably accountable.Both sides should cool it. The lobby should admit that its clique is unacceptably clubby for st-century politics. And Boris’s henchmen should drop the macho posturing. Why are they picking this fight at a time when the Government is so popular  Never a better time for it, they might say. They want to show who’s boss.You could compare their aggression to that of an inmate who on arrival in prison butts the first guy he meets in order to show other prisoners he’s a tough guy. In my experience, journalists respond badly to this approach.Look at the damage Tony Blair’s thuggish spokesman Alastair Campbell did to the government he served.It is not beyond the wit of ministers to palm favourable stories to selected journaliststhey so wish. But the central media unit at No should remember — as they have repeatedly told us — that they are “the people’s Government” and not merely the servants of Boris Johnson.Their juicy salaries come from the taxpayer and the taxpayer does not expect them to abuse their privileged position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future.

Shipley, , admitted fraudulently gaining a £, investment in his financial recruitment company by altering his bank statements to inflate his earnings. Bespectacled Shipley appeared at Southwark Crown Court in a smart blue suit and remained expressionless as he was jailed for three years and nine months. Gareth Munday, prosecuting, earlier told the court: Between  and June  Mr Shipley was employed by a firm specialising in financial recruitment. He worked to place people in employment within a financial institution. After leaving, he proposed a new business venture which was a recruitment and financial advice firm. In order to fund the start up of the business he sought funding from the company Resourcing Capital Ventures. It was a Dragonaposs Den style pitch. Shipley was asked to prove his own income which would also be used to finance the business, as well as proving his expertise in financial recruitment.  He used his P to show a salary of £, and that £, had been put in his bank account which he said was from commissions. On that assurance they agreed to fund Spitfire and it was created, Mr Munday said. However the bank statements and the P were . He later admitted that he photoshopped the documents but denied that he had done anything wrong. Mr Munday told the court his salary was less than £,, describing Shipley as an underachiever. He said: Between the years of  and  the only commission he had earned was £,.  Essentially he had not placed people and he had in fact left his previous employment under a cloud. He had failed to turn up for his employment and when asked, he said his dad had died. The company found out about the lie when they phoned his house to express their condolences and spoke to his father. When interviewed by police Mr Shipley said he had not done anything wrong, simply photoshopped his statements, it was a white lie. Benjamin Narain, defending, said the Tory activist showed genuine remorse. He felt guilt and embarrassment, he is genuinely sorry for being involved in this offence, he said. He accepts the forged bank statements and P were wrong, he said.  However all losses from this business do not stem from that fraud. Losses happen because businesses fail but it did not fail solely because of Mr Shipley. The barrister said Resourcing Capital Ventures had only lost around £, as they had reclaimed a great deal of the money by selling their shares back to Shipley. But reading a statement from a representative of RCV, Judge Martin Grfith said: This man said that without the bank statements we would not have touched him with a barge pole. They say they would not have even taken the meeting. Mr Narain had urged the court to aposread between the linesapos and consider that Shipley was in aposa lot of pain.apos He had an MRI on Tuesday for a bowel problem, he has seen several doctors and in his experience with the NHS they have been quick,apos Mr Narain said.  We can read between the lines here but he is in a lot of pain, using the bathroom in double figures, often needing to shower and wash himself afterwards. Mr Narain added that Shipleyaposs career in politics was over forever. He has undergone extensive tests for an undiagnosed illness in his throat and was recently awaiting the results for an MRI scan on his bowel. It must have been perfectly clear to you that that was a load of old rubbish, the judge said about Shipleyaposs defence that photoshopping the P was a aposwhite lieapos. You must have known you were guilty of the offence. Judge Grfith added: As far as Iaposm concerned medical reports show that youaposre perfectly well for me to sentence to custody.

Ronnie Russell, now , tackled gunman Ian Ball after he shot four people in the  London drama. The ex-boxer revealed police visited him before he was given a medal and said she would pay for his house “as a gt”. Ronnie told how the Queen got him out of a big financial hole by paying off his mortgage after his Princess Anne kidnap heroics. But,  years on, the former boxer has revealed he is again struggling to make ends meet and is reluctantly putting the George Medal he received for bravery up for auction to pay for his funeral. Breaking his silence for the first time since, Ronnie recalled the Queen’s ­kindness in helping him out after he bravely stepped in and saved Anne’s le – as the Palace insisted the cash would have come from private funds. Crazed gunman Ian Ball, then , had already shot the Princess’s chauffeur, minder, a policeman and a passing Mirror reporter as he tried to drag her from a car in Central London in . But in recent years the -year-old has suffered a string of serious health ­problems and run up a mountain of debt due to being unable to work. Ronnie said: “I’ve been very, very unwell, it’s rough. I have been realising I have to make provision for a funeral at some stage. I want to know that’s all done for and not leave that burden to someone . “It was something I said I would never, ever do. I am so proud and honoured to have done such a thing that I would never, ever sell it [the medal].” Ronnie recalled the moment he discovered the Queen was going to rescue him as he stood on the brink of losing his home in Strood, Kent, because he could not pay the mortgage. He was visited by police before he was due to receive his medal at ­Buckingham Palace. Ronnie added: “They were looking round my home and saying, ‘Oh this is a nice house.’ They askedI had a mortgage and I said yes, yes, why  “They said, ‘Well we are really telling you this a bit early but the Queen is going to pay off your mortgage as a gt for what you have done.’ “I thought that was wonderful. I was actually close to repossession at the time. They were going to repossess my home. So I dug myself out of that one.”  Ronnie, who lives in a rented Bristol council flat with partner Mandy and runs Swindon Speedway club, kept details of the Queen’s generosity to himself - until now. And a royal source said: “This would have been a deeply private matter and certainly no publicity would have been sought from the Palace or the Queen.” Another added: “Any such instance of generosity would have been made from the Queen’s private funds.” Dad-of-three Ronnie told of the dramatic day he helped save Princess Anne on March , , when he was , weighed st and was super fit. He came across the drama by chance after taking a shortcut down the Mall on his way to work with a cleaning firm. Ball had blocked Anne’s car and fired several shots through the rear window.  Armed with two revolvers, he shot her protection team and passing Mirrorman Brian McConnell.Ronnie said: “I wasn’t ­frightened. I had no idea who was in the car but I when I saw him shoot the copper I thought, that’s taking the p*ss, so I went for him.“I went to hit him around the back of the head and he turned and fired. It went through a taxi windscreen.” Ronnie, who has beaten cancer twice, had seven strokes and has arthritis, told how Ball tried to grab Anne, who was , while husband Mark Phillips pulled her away. He said: “There was banging and smashing going on. He had Princess Anne by the arm. There was a tug of war. “She was calm. She said: ‘Go away you silly man.’ I saw a door was open. I said: ‘Come this way, Anne, you will be safe. Ronnie then realised Ball was behind him with a loaded gun. He said: “At that point I thought it was now or never. I hit Ball very hard, square on the chin.“He was flat on the floor face down. I jumped on his back for good measure. I could have died, yeah, but I knew what I was doing. The only person I did not want to get shot was Princess Anne.” Ball was detained under the Mental Health Act and remains in Broadmoor high-security hospital to this day. Ronnie’s medal will be sold in London by Dix Noonan Webb next month. He said: “I just hope whoever buys it will invite me to lunch or something, where I could tell the story properly.” Mirror man shot tackling the gunman  Ronnie Russell was not the only hero that night, and Mirror reporter Brian McConnell was shot in the chest trying to save the Princess from kidnap. Brave McConnell, who was , saw the incident unfold while in a passing cab. He jumped out as the gunman threatened the Princess’s bodyguard. He stepped between the royal and the gunman and tried to reason with him. In a gripping first-person account from his hospital bed, McConnell told the Mirror about his experience.

Before she left she asked for an hour alone to come to terms with the heartbreaking loss of her dad, before committing herself to her public duty and discussing the practicalities of herhome. As they sat on the plane home on February , , Prince Philip took an intimate video of his we, which shows her looking deep in thought and emotional. The -second clip shows her eating lunch with Lady in Waiting Pamela Mountbatten and three male aides at the start of the BOAC flight from Entebbe, Uganda to London. When she realises she is being filmed by her husband, she breaks into a warm, brave smile - an early sign of the inner strength and resolve to put duty first she has shown many, many times since. A few moments later she looks more emotional - her sad expression a reminder that this is a young woman who has just lost her father and at the same time inherited the huge responsibility for the Crown. Aged just , she was now Sovereign of  countries, ruling over an estimated  million people worldwide, who were now looking to her to lead the way. This unprecedented glimpse into one of the most intimate moments of royal le had not even been seen by Prince Charles until it was unearthed for his televised tribute to his mother, shown on BBC in . When the enormity of the moment he was witnessing on screen dawned on him he said in shock: Oh... That must be on the aeroplane.  I presume itaposs my father taking the photograph. Iaposve never seen this before. So these must have been the first pictures taken of my mama after she knew she was Queen. Charles looked emotional as he contemplated the huge constitutional responsibility that had fallen on his mother in a moment of such personal sadness. He appeared to be choking back tears as watched his mother - dressed in a simple navy blue suit that she later swapped for black clothes on arrival in London - contemplate her destiny.  He said: One of my greatest regrets is not having known him- and I really mind that. As soon as news reached them of King Georgeaposs death the new Queen and Philip hastily flew home from Africa - just six days into their trip - to Charles and Anne, who were then just three and one.

Innocent people lost their lives because terrorists were released from jail even though they continued to pose a threat. Ministers are now in a race against time to get new laws through Parliament before another potentially dangerous jihadi is let out of prison. The Government is acting with the right intentions but we have learned from experience that rushed laws are not always the best laws. While we understand the need to act quickly, it is also important that the Government comes up with a response that will stand the test of time. It must have the support of the Muslim community and it needs to recognise that current de-radicalisation programmes are not working. Ministers should also explorethere are more effective measures than indeterminate prison sentences such as bringing back the control orders the Coalition government abolished in . This problem requires more than a knee-jerk response but a comprehensive plan that addresses the everything from the crisis in our prisons to more police on our streets to building trust in our communities. Kidsapos joy cut There are few greater gts you can give to a child than the joy of reading. Through books you can discover new worlds, spark an interest in a career and fire the imagination. For many young people the gateway to a le of reading is their local library.  But that door is being increasingly closed to children because of Conservatives cuts. Not only are there fewer libraries, they have fewer books on display. Figures unearthed by Labour show that more than  million books have been cut from libraries in England since the Tories came to power in . In that period we have also seen  libraries closed.

James Brown, her boyfriend, was close to her family and the couple lived together at a previous address in Crookedholm in KIlmarnock, Scotland. However, in  Nicole’s world came to a halt when she discovered Brown had been sexually assaulting her in her sleep and filming the ordeal on his camera. Last month, -year-old Brown, of Lanehead Terrace, New Cumnock, was sentenced to  months in prison and placed on the sex offendersapos register for  years after admitting the offences at Kilmarnock Sherf Court. Nicole, , has bravely decided to waive her right to anonymity and share her ordeal in the hope it might inspire others. “It was the worst day of my le, she said. I thought I could move on but it’s constantly on my mind. I see him in my head all the time – how do you erase that ”  Speaking to the Kilmarnock Standard during Sexual Abuse and Sexual Violence Awareness Month , Nicole told how she felt “horried, “violated” and “mortied” following the discovery of a USB containing images and video of her body, taken during her sleep without her consent.  Brown pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting Nicole while she was asleep. He also admitted recording a video and images of Nicole’s body while she was asleep.  The court heard how the pictures and video were contained on a USB belonging to Brown and had been discovered by his brother and eventually passed to Nicole in , a year after the couple had separated. Nicole said: “I was shaking when I put the USB in the TV. I finally plucked up the courage and that’s when I watched the video.  “I put the volume up to  and you can hear that I’m snoring – I’m a deep, deep snorer.”  Nicole said having to view the files made her feel “sick” and described her lack of control as “looking like a dead person”. She said: “I don’t move at all. It’s like I’m dead. “I started to remember small signs in the relationship.  “One morning I woke up and felt sore and when I told him he laughed, but then I saw the video and he is violating me while I’m asleep. “The penny just dropped and I realised any time I have been sore that’s what has happened.  “I watched everything in full. With the pictures, it’s ashe is trying to tell a story. “He took the time to put them together in a sequence like a picture story – that’s what the police told me.”  For two months, Nicole battled with the decision over what to do with the files before finally gathering the courage to seek help.  After speaking with a member of STAR Centre Ayrshire, who offer free and confidential support to anyone who has experienced sexual violence, the matter was reported to police. Nicole said: “I remember standing near the bus stop outside Kilmarnock police station and I just broke and felt like I couldn’t do it. “The interview went on for hours and hours but then at the end a female officer came in and told me they had enough information to charge him.”  Nicole then faced the prospect of having to give evidence during a trial. “I was mortied to think that I would have to stand up there,” she said. “It would have gone before a jury. But I was ready to do it”. Thankfully Nicole received the news that Brown had pleaded guilty but she said: “I hope no one has to go through what I went through”.  Nicole, a former carer, believed Brown’s actions show a disregard for consent in a sexual relationship. Former carer Nicole added: “He is a predator. He took my dignity away. He doesn’t understand consent. Consent means everyone involved is willing. You are not sleeping – you’re not snoring – there is communication.” "},{"url":null,"title":"friend spots creepy detail girls","story":"NewsFriend spots creepy detail in girls selfie who failed to notice shes not aloneOlivia Nunn, who was feeling slightly worse for wear after a big night out with the girls, sent a selfie to the group chat - but had failed to notice an unwelcome guest hiding in her hoodShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsOlivia didnt notice something  lurking in the photo - but her friends did \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

His replacement Osman Sow was stretchered off on Saturday. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’ll sit out the rest of the campaign as well.But it’s a sign of the quality they have in their squad that Clark and Sow can be missing and you still have a striker of the calibre of Lawrence Shankland to lead the line. vw, px\"  Sow being out leaves a great chance for youngsters like Declan Glass and Chris Mochrie to show what they can do in the No  position.It’s unfortanute for people to get injured but also a great chance for some of United’s youngsters to impress.On top of Sow’s injury, Paul McMullan, Louis Appere and Calum Butcher have been carrying injuries recently, too.This week is an ideal time to give the players a bit of a break and recharge the batteries for the run-in.The Tangerines want to get that title wrapped up as soon as possible but this breather couldn’t have been better timed.Once again, other teams weren’t really able to make up any ground on the runaway leaders – Inverness clawed one point back at home to Alloa.United are the only team that have managed any sort of consistency this season – a wee break is just what they need to get going again."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.45893062-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.45893062-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.45893062-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.45893062-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundees gin fest promising to be bigger and better","story":"Dundee events boss Carrie Shannon is to stage the city’s fourth gin festival.And she revealed a generous chunk of this year’s takings will go to charity.Carrie, , is planning a host of events in the city this season, although the Gin Fest at Bonar Hall has become a key date for many fans.This is set to be the biggest and best so far with a few changes from last year’s line up.She said: “I have a new partner to link up with for this Gin Fest and they have a charity which we will be giving a percentage of the ticket sales to.“The confirmation for all that has still to be finalised, but it will all be announced very soon.“Once again a lot of the focus will be on local products with local gins included.“But this time we will be introducing Scottish vodkas and rums to the occasion.“There was a prosecco bar last year, however, it did not take off as much as expected.“But you can never tell until the day with new ideas.”Tickets for the festival, which is being held on May , are now on sale and full details are available at theginfestCarrie added: “We had more than  people attend last time over the two sessions and again I want to support local products, but there will be others from around Scotland.“So hopefully everything goes to plan and we bring a lot of people into Dundee.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3a89398efbe7.12644030-831x564.jpg ","title":"elliott happy to be utility man if it means upturn in dee fortunes","story":"New boy Christie Elliott says he’s happy to arrive as Dundee’s utility man – as long as it means the Dark Blues can get their act together in their promotion play-off push.The former Partick Thistle player takes on his old side this weekend in what’s likely to be his home debut.After last weekend’s -

That happens in football.“I want to play and I’ve played the majority of my career in Scotland so when the opportunity came up to join a massive club, there was only one thing on my mind and that was to come up here and get it sorted.“I came up to Dundee last Friday and was in the stadium the majority of the day getting things sorted.“I knew a few of the boys from before but Saturday was the first day I actually met the team so it’ll be good to have a full week together before this weekend’s game.“It is hard to come into a team like that, you just have to adapt quickly.“It can actually be a good thingyou don’t know many people because you have to make an effort to get to know them and their game.”And Elliott has been impressed with the quality in the Dens Park squad, evenhe felt they should have done better in his debut at Cappielow last Saturday.“There are big players in this team.

debts","story":"Aberdeen council chiefs have revealed plans to recover £, in school meal debts from parents in the city.It comes as a new report exposed a loophole in Aberdeen City Council’s system which means it has not been telling some parents when primary school pupils spend more money at lunchtime than is available on their ‘Kidz’ meal payment cards.The council’s system allows for debt to be discovered when children start secondary school, but the council has decided not to take parents to task – until now.Members of the council’s audit, risk and scrutiny committee will meet next Wednesday to decidethe council should “establish a process for identying and recovering debts arising from non-payment of school meals”.Explaining the loophole, the report said: “When the system was set up schools were advised that,the account went into debt, parents would automatically be advised through the balance alerts system.“However, not all parents will receive these alerts, since parents can opt out of receiving them and have to re-register for the alertsthey change email address or mobile phone number.“As a result, some of the debts owed to schools have become signicant – £,.”The report added that secondary school pupils cannot spend more than is on their cards so new starters “would not able to use the card until the debt was cleared” but the council’s education service “made the decision to freeze debt related to Kidz Cards”.The committee’s vice-convenor Ian Yuill said: “Clearly I would expect the council staff to seek to recover debt whatever that is for.“Equally, it is important systems work properly to ensure debt doesn’t build up.”Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden, of the Conservatives, said: “It is clear we can do better on this, but the key point is we would never allow a child – particularly a primary school child – to go unfed at school.“We could never turn them away.“This committee does some good work in scrutinising and looks to suggest potential savings for the council.”SNP group leader Alex Nicoll said: “The council must ensure a pragmatic approach to the debt collection as I wouldn’t want us chasing parents for a few pounds, however this is a large sum of money.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/5e3a6969d30090.05273328-846x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen road closures announced for

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved. He is survived by his we, Anne, two daughters, mother, his two brothers and his two sisters.Irreplaceable but not forgotten in Lilliesleaf, Kelso and the Borders, William Graham Douglas, his father Bill, his grandfather, Willie, and his great grandfather, William.Ron Wilson"},{"url":null,"title":"alleged-stalker-remanded-custody","story":"A -year-old man has been remanded in custody at Jedburgh Sherf Court after being accused of stalking a former partner.Vincent Cardle - who gave an address in Roxburghshire - made no plea during a private hearing and the case was continued for further examination.Bail was refused and he was remanded in custody and is due to appear in court again later this week."},{"url":null,"title":"douglas-crawford-announced-2020s-melrosian-elect","story":"LEADING as this years Melrosian-elect,is -year-old Douglas Crawford.Douglas, who is currently studying a Masters degree in Performance Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, was revealed as the new Melrosian at the annual Ex-Melrosian Burns Supper last weekend.Douglas told us: \"Im really excited, Im looking forward to the summer now.\"It was a really good night, the speakers were fantastic, last years Melrosian, Ben, spoke well.\"I had a lot of family there so it was really special to be announced.\"Douglas will join other members of his family, including his father, who have taken up the role of Melrosian in the past, which he said makes the honour \"even more special.\"He added: \"I and my family are so grateful for this opportunity.\"Im just looking forward to the festivities getting underway.\"The Corn Exchange played host to the sell-out evening on Saturday, January , celebrating the Bards birthday where guests were entertained by an outstanding lineup of speakers and entertainers.Stephen Amos gave the Immortal Memory and the Toast to the Lassies was made by Melrosian , Ben Magowan, which was matched by an excellent reply from Rev.

I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoon-pubs-tell-parents-children-can-two-drinks","story":"Its a question thats sparked a debate on social media after it was revealed Wetherspoon pubs limit parents to two alcoholic drinks eachthey have children with them.The rule came to light after a picture was taken of a poster in a pub in Kent.The poster, which has since been taken down, read: \"As part of our licensing it is our responsibility to ensure that we are protecting children from harm.\"Therefore adults in charge of children will be allowed to have one alcoholic drink and a further alcoholic drink with a sit-down meal.\"It has been a crime since  to be drunk in charge of a child under the age of seven in a public place.The offence can be punished by a fine or up to a month in jail.A spokesman for Wetherspoon,which has a pub on Musselburghs Bridge Street, The David Macbeth Moir,said: \"The manager took the decision to put the poster in the pub to emphasise to customers that she would not allow parents to drink while their children were running round uncontrolled in the pub.\"The notice had a positive effect, with mostly good feedback.\"Wetherspoonadded: \"There is a guideline, though not a policy, that we will serve the adult a maximum of two alcoholic drinks with their meal.\"The reason is that we dont want children being unruly in the pubs and parents thinking they can continue to drink while this happens.\""},{"url":null,"title":"car-plummets-20ft-off-dunbar-sea-wall-onto-beach","story":"Thankfully,no-one was in the Vauxhall Zafira when it suffered suspected handbrake failure and plummeted onto Dunbars East Beach from the towns Lamer Street at about .am.There were walkers on the beach but they were not nearby.The Courier understands the cars owners were on a day trip to Dunbar from Edinburgh.One passer-by said: \"Luckily, no-one was in the car at the time - it was not the day out that the car owners had planned!\"A tow truck appeared later in the day to take the battered car - which had flipped onto its roof - off the beach."},{"url":null,"title":"east-coast-buses-fares-rise-weekend","story":"Adult singles fares will rise by p across all zones.

In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

Whether in the town or on the motorway, hybrids feel no dferent to drive than a petrol car, offering a quiet and relaxing ride and still delivers the power you need.Speaking about the increase in hybrid orders, Kirsteen McGuire, Helensburgh Toyota Sales Manager said: ldquoThe hybrid message across the car industry is finally hitting home. More and more people are making the switch to hybrid and in turn benefitting from lower tax and petrol costs. Where other car manufacturers are playing catch up, Toyota has been a trusted advocate of hybrid technology for many years. The reality is that manufacturers are moving to eventually producing only hybrid vehicles.

Taking experience in renewable energy using Solar PV and a passion for zero emission transport, they decided that an independent company not linked to any manufacturer of cars, charge points or energy provider, would allow them to offer impartial advice to customers choosing to go electric for the first time.When plugging in the car at home, the smart charge point automatically decides when it is cheapest to charge. Paying just p per kWh overnight, which means you can travel up to , miles for just pound, compared to over pound in an efficient mpg petrol or diesel car. Even using typical electricity tarfs, customers are travelling over , miles per year for less than pound.To encourage EV drivers to charge safely at home rather than relying on the pin plug adaptor, the UK Government offers pound OLEV grant towards the cost of installing a home charge point. In Scotland, a further pound cash-back is available from Energy Saving Trust , reducing the cost further and in some installations covering the cost completely.

And then Johnson decided to ban media he doesnrsquot like from official briefings.Trump had the press by the throat from day one. It was either lick his boots, or suffer. Strongmen wannabes like to keep critics quiet. Erdogan in Turkey, Orban in Hungary ndash like Johnson, theyrsquore big Trump buddies ndash and like Trump they want a tame press.Once the press is dealt with, then itrsquos time to start tinkering with other inconveniences which check power, like judges. Johnson has hinted that the judiciary will have a price to pay for meddling in Brexit.So buckle up for a bumpy ride, while Johnson gets Brexit done.How will the Scottish Government and the SNP deal with this  Strongmen-types also like an enemy. Thatrsquos the role Johnson wants the SNP to play.Johnson is an agent of chaos. He wins by creating drama and then letting his rivals drown amid a welter of headlines as they try to figure out what the hell is going on. He causes chaos, others step in to clean up the mess, and they take the bullet for their troubles. Just ask David Cameron and Theresa May. Or cast an eye over what remains of the Labour party.The SNP may think being pitted against Johnson is good for them, but is it also good for Scotland So far, the SNPrsquos response to Johnson has been to shout \"independence\" at every opportunity. Party managers might believe this to be a great strategy ndash that it keeps passion burning in the hearts of true believers ndash but itrsquos already getting wearying.Throughout the torture of Brexit ndash in fact, in response to almost anything that ever happens at Westminster ndash itrsquos looked to the public asall the SNP does is simply shout independence.The tactic is beginning to suffer from the law of diminishing s. The more itrsquos heard, the more meaningless it becomes. And the more itrsquos shouted, the more one wondersthe party has any other ideas.Johnson knows the public in Scotland is as tired as the public where on these islands after Brexit. The idea of more endless constitutional warfare is far from appealing. Every time the SNP shouts independence at Johnson, many voters wince at the thought of more ision. Johnson also knows that all the SNP can do is shout ndash as, like it or not, he decidesand when therersquos a referendum.If the SNP continues to endlessly shout independence when we all know there wonrsquot be a referendum any time soon then it will appear not just like a grievance machine, but weak. Even worse, the SNP will look like itrsquos playing the public for fools.Endless cries of independence will also achieve little in Scotland. The Yes and No side are polling pretty evenly. Only clever, original politicking will change minds.Nicola Sturgeon has admitted there may not be another referendum until after the next Scottish elections. Everyone  knew this was the case, but to the marchers and flag-wavers, it was betrayal. You can see why ndash they were led by the nose, the mantra of independence fed to them daily. Now they feel cheated. So, the strategy of endlessly crying independence has already caused harm within the party.To many average Yes voters, the endless calls for independence are now like background static. The SNP risks becoming boring, a one-note tune that everyone knows. In modern politics, boredom means defeat. Itrsquos not that the Yes movement is boring, we expect the Yes movement to play one instrument and play it well. But with a party, you want an orchestra.Of course, the party would say that it does much more than shout about independence. True, but impressions matter, and it seems the SNP has only one word as answer to every question.The party itself is tired. Itrsquos record in government is increasingly anaemic when it comes to big domestic issues like health and schools.Perhaps, the party thinks concentrating on independence takes the focus off poor hospitals and education  Well, maybe it would,the SNP could stick to one message on independence.Therersquos constant mixed messaging. Some take pots shots at the leadership. Others are loyal. Some fancy wildcat referendums. Others donrsquot. Some say stop marching. Others wave their Saltire. Some cosy up to online bullies. Others decry them.Then lsquoexcitementrsquo around Nicola Sturgeonrsquos much-awaited speech last week on the future of independence turns anti-climactic. It was staid, managerial. She called for patience, said therersquod be no shortcuts, and urged the party to build the case for independence.Voters would be forgiven for asking whatrsquos going on  Run the country, quit bickering, and stop leading us all on. Outside the twin bubbles of politics and the press, and the echo chamber of social media, the public cares about jobs, schools, cops on the beat, and hospitals.Sturgeon also plans a Constitutional Convention and a series of papers on independence. This work needs done, but it will also add to the narrative that all the SNP talks about is independence.And whisper it, unlikely though it is, Brexit may not usher in a new Dark Age. It might go OK. It might just be a bit awful. If the cataclysm doesnrsquot appear, what does that mean for independence The one thing which will help independence  Good government. Run this country well and No voters may slowly but surely switch to Yes.Noel Dolan, Sturgeonrsquos former senior adviser, made clear yesterday that itrsquos pointless to simply demand that Johnson grants another referendum. Dolanrsquos right. The only path to another referendum is for the SNP and Labour to cut a deal in order to get the Tories out of power. The SNP supports the next Labour government, and then Labour agrees to a second independence referendum.Itrsquoll take time, but the strategy is correct: donrsquot just talk ndash do.

Which begs the question: why in the name of Ena Sharplesrsquo hair net has it lasted for  years  What is there about the storylines and characters that continue to draw us in  How can cobbled-street dialogue seduce so deliciously Now, I hate Coronation Street. Or rather I hate myself for watching it three times a week, although I attempt to allocate it as a guilty pleasure.Yet, between you and me, Irsquove been having a think about its pulling power.Coronation Street is an education in social psychology. It makes us consider societyrsquos paradigms of the bully, the idiot, the matriarchal woman, for example.The Streetrsquos multi-layered textures enable us to flit between complexity and stupidity, which is exactly what we encounter in our everyday lives.Itrsquos a gentle intravenous injection of reality, itrsquos homeopathic medicine, a mild poison that we can gradually introduce into our system, rather like watching a weekrsquos episodes of Loose Women.Now, I like to think I can see the storylines coming a mile off, the well-worn tropes. Yet, such is the skill of the writing wersquore gradually seduced, prepared to buy into this heightened reality.In amongst tales of how car mechanic Abi can fire up a knackered engine within minutes, for example, therersquos usually a plot line of wrenching pathos, which you know will result in her heart breaking very, very soon.In soap we are taught the lesson that everything has to go wrong. Indeed, in the Street the perfect relationship is an oxymoron. In the Street crime is almost always a constant, and where there is no criminal act there is the suspicion of same, which leads to wonderful  accusations, prosecutions and often jail. Tragedy abounds.And the complex, but often daft, storylines allow us to debate moral value systems. The Ken Barlow ergent theory, for example, is all important in helping us contend with those with mixed personality traits: the boss who can be kind ndash and a monster in equal measure, the man who adores his we ndash and yet has had a series of mistresses. And he makes us evaluate the concept of the patriarchy.Meanwhile, we can hate Gary Windass because hersquos a loan-sharking thug, but we also know he suffers from PTSD, from his army stint.Context plus personal decoding equals continued interest.This hermeneutic space between comprehension and interpretation is delicious. While Kirk Sutherland is clearly a couple of dog biscuits short of a dinner, this reality is suffused cleverly by the autodidactic Roy Cropper, who will readily quote Wordsworth, or Kant. As will Mary Taylor during her soliloquies. Meanwhile, Gail Platt does little more than bleat like Bo Peeprsquos herd.And how can we not wallow in a show in which the smug and the pompous, the likes of Percy Sugden and Maurice Cole, arenrsquot found out Thatrsquos not to say Corrie always gets it right. To be honest, I wouldnrsquot careTyrone Dobbs and Fiz Brown never saw their dficult child again ndash shersquos a case for the reintroduction of orphanages. And I think the writers have created some plot stinkers, and jumped the shark all too often with the introduction of Lorraine Kelly and Status Quo.Now, you may argue other soaps should be mentioned in the mix. Itrsquos fair to say BBC Scotlands River City manages a neat balance between gratuitous Glasgow gangsterism and illicit affairing.EastEnders, however, is simply awful, full of horrid people.Emmerdale seems to be too inbred. And Hollyoaks is a  minute selfie.Anyway, soaps are like lovers: you should confine yourself to one at a time.But whatrsquos really great about Corrie is that all genders are allowed to be rotten. Wersquove had female monsters, female irritants, transsexual robbers, and they come in all shapes and colours. Coronation Street is clearly very comfy in its own skins.It also has excellent writers who can provide brilliant barbs for its ndash usually female ndash characters such as Elsie Tanner, Blanche Hunt and more recently Maureen Lipmanrsquos Evelyn Plummer.I like the description of Steve McDonald and Tracy Barlows relationship: \"Like Burton and Taylor in a terrace.\" Or Tracyrsquos passing remark: \"Mary found a downstairs hair in the tagine.\"Coronation Street works because it realises our lives are a work in progress.

The Bioersity Challenge Fundspecically encourages applicants with innovative projects that improve bioersity and address the impact of climate change, increasing the resilience of our most at-risk habitats and species and creating large areas of brand new or restored habitat.Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We all have a central role to play in combating bioersity loss and tackling the global climate emergency.“Bioersity loss and climate change are intimately bound together. Nature plays a key role in defining and regulating our climate and climate is key in shaping the state of nature.“People and communities who want to be at the forefront of pioneering work to restore our habitats, protect our species and promote nature can now apply for additional support through the Bioersity Challenge Fund.”Scottish Natural Heritage chief executive Francesca Osowska has been excited by the very high quality of applications received so far, and would love to hear even more bright ideas.“People know that climate change is a big issue but not as many know that bioersity loss is also a global and generational threat to human well-being,” she said. “Pollinators are a vital part of the building blocks of le on earth, and we need to support all of Scotland’s bioersity, from bees and butterflies to pondle and peatlands, because enriching our nature is also an important part of the solution to the climate emergency.“Nature is at the heart of what we do, and we will continue to deliver the transformational change needed to bring a nature-rich future for Scotland.”More information about the fund can be found at Bioersity Challenge Funddata-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The fire service is eager for us all to avoid the devastating consequences of white goods catching fire in our homes.\"  Fires caused by white goods are a daily occurence viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog ellon visitor centre plan approved","story":"Plans to create a new bar and visitor centre in Ellon have been approved.Brewing giants BrewDog submitted plans to Aberdeenshire Council in November last year for the creation of a new bar and visitor centre next to its Ellon headquarters.The new bar and visitor centre will be located inside the existing building at Balmacassie Industrial Estate that previously belonged to Power Jacks.The brewing firm will change part of the unit from office accommodation and production space to a new ‘DogTap’ public house and visitor centre.BrewDog took ownership of the building in  after Power Jacks moved to Westhill. It was initially proposed that BrewDog would transform the building into ‘The DogHouse’ Hotel but the plan never came to fruition.The new proposal will see the relocation of the existing ‘DogTap’ bar which is “oversubscribed” and no longer suitable to meet customer demand.The new bar will also feature a ‘BottleDog’ retail area where customers can buy bottles of beer and other merchandise. As with the existing bar, food will continue to be served on the site.A dedicated events space and beer museum will be created to give visitors the chance to see how the brewing process works.External changes will be made to the existing site including the addition of an outdoor seating area and children’s play area.Aberdeenshire Council planners approved the plans stating that the proposal is “appropriate” for the site given and “is in keeping with the character of the wider area in that it provides s directly related and ancillary to neighbouring sites”.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpeg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gillian Martin MSP with Ron MacDonald, Secretary of the Newburgh  Ythan Community Trust, at Ythan Estuary\"  MSP welcomes Ythan Seal Viewing Project cash viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new appointment for inverurie orchestra","story":"Inverurie Orchestra has welcomed Ignasi Sol# as its new Conductor and Music Director.The appointment comes following the departure of Dr Paul Tierney last year who led the -strong orchestra from its inception in .The Orchestra played its last concert with Dr Tierney before Christmas to a packed Acorn Centre delivering \"The Snowman\" to considerable acclaim.Dr Tierney is moving on to embrace other responsibilities and continues as Music Director at Haddo.Ignasi was born in Catalunya and began his cello studies at the age of  tutored by the cello disciples of Pablo Casals, Jacques Doué and Peter Thielemann.During his youth Ignasi won several prizes for young musicians.At the age of  he was accepted at the prestigious Liceu of Barcelona to study cello performance with the principal cello of the Spanish National Symphony Orchestra, Angel Luis Quintana.At the same time he took up a place as solo cello at the Young Opera of Catalonia.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In them, he calls the youngster \"really cute\" and invites him to a rugby match.The First Minister also said he will be kicked out the SNP Parliamentary group in an emergency statement to MSPs today.\"His conduct fell well short of whats expected as a minister,\" Ms Sturgeon told MSPs in a statement in the Scottish Parliament.Mr Mackay quit as Finance Secretary this morning after the allgegatisn came to light: FMQs LIVE: Nicola Sturgeon reveals she has suspended Derek Mackay from SNP: Derek Mackay: Finance Secretary resigns amid allegations he sent inappropriate messages to -year-old boyMs Sturgeon added: \"DerekMackay has apologised unreservedly for his conduct and recognises, as I do, that it was unacceptable and falls seriously below the standards required by a minister.\"I can also advise that he has this morning been suspended from both the SNP and our Parliamentary group pending further investigation.\"She also confirmed that the Government will continue with the budget which Mr Mackay was scheduled to deliver this afternoon. It will instead be delivered by public finance minister Kate Forbes.Ms Sturgeon was then questioned on what she knew about Mr Mackays actions. Scottish Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw about the impact on the reputation of the parliament, and politics generally and whether the First Minister knew of any other similar behaviour by Mr Mackay, andthe government was supporting the boy involved The First Minister said she would \"not minimise in any way the seriousness of this\", and that once she had read the full transcript of the messages Mr Mackay had been suspended from the SNP and parliamentary group \"pending further investigation\".She added: \"Its reasonable and important to let that investigation take place without me pre-empting that outcome. \"I am not aware of any further allegations of conduct of a similar nature but I was not aware of this until last night. \"I want to make clear, and I hope members will accept this, I do not condone in any way shape or form conduct of this nature. We need to say that when it is our opponents or people in our own side, and we have to be consistent.\"Im not away of the identity [of the boy involved] or the contact details of the family, howeverthey want to speak to me I would be happy to do that.\"All of us have to be prepared to apply high standards when these allegations are made, and make sure action we demand of our opponents is actions we would take ourselves. Clearly there are issues that Derek Mackay has to reflect on. But Derek Mackay remaining in government is simply not an option.\"No matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations theres a need for due process. I believe its right and proper for that to happen.\"Mr Carlaw then read out the NSPCC definition of child grooming. It states: \"Grooming is when someone builds a relationship, trust and emotional connection with a child or young person so they can manipulate, exploit and abuse them.\"It is when someone builds a relationship of trust with a young person so they can manipulate and exploit them. Young people can be groomed online... and may not understand theyve been groomed.\"He asked how the reputation of the parliament \"can be maintained with the full confidence of the publicMr Mackay remains a member \"Ms Sturgeon responded: \"I am in no way minimising the seriousness of this, I am not deferring to an investigation, action that has been taken already it should be obvious to everyone how serious I and my government are treating this matter. Where others have to consider future action, theres a process to go through.\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard also mentioned Mr Mackays resignation, before he raised questions about NHS Tayside. He said: \"Derek Mackay, this morning, described his own behaviour as foolish. But his actions are beyond foolish. They are an abuse of power. Theyre nothing short of predatory. This is serious. While his suspension from the SNP is welcome, he should go as a member of this parliament.Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added:\"These are troubling and alarming events. Derek Mackay should step down as an MSP.ldquoWe must support the young person and his family, who have been targeted by a person in a position of power.\"ldquoItrsquos important that we understand what went on, what action has been taken so far and what action will be taken now by Parliament, Government and the SNP.Scottish Greens parliamentary co-leader Alison Johnstone branded Mr Mackays behaviour \"utterly unacceptable.\"She added: \"His persistent and unwanted approaches represent an abuse of power, and the impact on the family cannot be overstated.

Matthew Taggart, , who is in the first year of a foundation degree apprenticeship in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Translink in Belfast, said he believes the opportunity to gain qualications with no fees while getting paid to work is something that all young people should consider.Workplus, which helps employers develop talent through apprenticeships, estimates that almost poundm will be earned by the successful candidates over the period of their apprenticeships, some of which will last up to six years, with the possibility of permanent jobs.Those successful will take up positions at companies including Farrans, Translink, Atkins, Liberty IT, Jacobs and McAdam Design in the autumn to gain on the job training in career areas including engineering, construction, IT, administration and accountancy.Matthew said: “After my AS Levels at Ballymena Academy I went straight into a Workplus apprenticeship with Translink and spent two years doing a Level  BTEC. “Now I’m in the first year of a foundation degree, working on projects at Translink which are both interesting and challenging four days a week and attending classes at South West College in Omagh one day a week.“The greatest benefit of being an apprentice is that I’m able to work and learn on the job, while also working towards the qualications I need to apply for jobs within the industry.“Some of my friends who are at university wish they’d taken the same path as me because I’m earning a wage and as my fees are being paid I’ll have no debt at the end. I’d recommend that all young people considering higher education take a look at the apprenticeship opportunities available with Workplus.”Gavin McFarland, Programme Manager at Translink, said: “Workplus gives us access to a large pool of talented young people. Our Civil Engineering apprentices are valued members of our Infrastructure and Projects team. They take full advantage of opportunities to develop their academic learning and professional qualications, while earning an attractive salary. We are pleased to support Workplus and would recommend it to other employers seeking to attract talented young people. “Richard Kirk, Director of Workplus, explained: “Many of the young people who are applying for Workplus Apprenticeships are telling us that full time study along with the debt and career uncertainty at the end is not the right route for them.“Our apprentices get real jobs, good pay with a starting salary between pound, to pound, depending on entry level, as well as access to training and professional networks that will transform their lives.”Applications for this year’s Workplus scheme are open until February  at www.workplus.app "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2720501.jpg--.jpg?1580387586000\n","title":"psni investigate burglaries at new housing development","story":"POLICE in Ballymena are appealing for information following the report of burglaries at three new build houses on the Sand Road on Wednesday, January .It is believed that entry was gained to the building site sometime between .pm on Tuesday and am on Wednesday morning.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"edmund rice to host an evening of light","story":"EDMUND Rice College in Glengormley are inviting the public to attend a special night to support mental health across the North Belfast community.The Evening of Light will take place at the school tonight Wednesdayat pm featuring music and reflection.Music will form a reflective and peaceful atmosphere for the evening, delivered by the Edmund Rice College School Choir, current Year  pupil Robert Hamilton and musicians Two Tempo.There will also be an opportunity to hear from two key speakers from Alpsand Mind Skills and information on their respective programs on mental health, resilience and suicide prevention.The first guest speaker, Frank Diamond is an integral part of the team at Live and Learn Alps, a not for profit organisation, working directly with communities offering support, guidance and education around mental health awareness and suicide prevention.The organisation was founded in September  and has trained upwards of , people in QPRtraining.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ambulance bosses sorry for craigavon pensioners three hour wait","story":"Criticism: Thomas Larkham FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCriticism: Thomas LarkhamGillian HallidayFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Northern Ireland Ambulance Servicehas apologised to a pensioner who waited nearly three hours for an ambulance after breaking her hip.The NIAS said the ordeal endured by the -year-old, who was forced to lie on ice-cold tiles while waiting, was unacceptable.A review into how the service handled the call will now be carried out. The woman broke her hip in a fall at a shopping area in Legahory in Craigavon last Friday.Members of the public, along with staff from a nearby medical centre, came to her aid after the incident.With an ambulance nowhere in sight, they resorted to using pieces of cardboard to keep her warm.She was reported to be on the mend on Tuesday after undergoing surgery at Craigavon Area Hospital. SDLP councillor Thomas Larkham, one of the people who helped the woman after she fell, welcomed the apology from the NIAS.I hope that this lady makes a full recovery, he said.However, Mr Larkham also stressed the episode was not an isolated incident and that the number of such cases was growing.I have the greatest regard for our ambulance service and staff, who work tirelessly day and night, Mr Larkham explained.But senior management need to explain why these situations where people are left waiting for hours on an ambulance are becoming more frequent.Mr Larkham said that he and his party colleagues would be raising the issue directly with Health Minister and Ulster Unionist Party MLA Robin Swann.The NIAS said in a statement that a  call was received just before pm and a emergency crew was despatched to the scene.However, the statement did not state what time the crew arrived, only explaining that the patient was taken to hospital after a medical assessment was carried out.We always prioritise our response to those patients who are most seriously ill and injured, the statement read.

The resident has three options - Yes, No and Don#t Care. At least two thirds of the people surveyed must be in favour of the proposal to erect a second street sign in a language other than English.If the resident gives a #Don#t Care# reply, ora letter is not ed, it is considered a negative response by the council.Sinn Fein councillor for Collin, Seanna Walsh, brought a motion to this week#s meeting of Belfast City Council proposing changes.Sinn Fein is proposing the council continues with the policy of a third of the eligible electorate in the street initiating the process, but amends the policy so that % plus one of respondents would determinethe petition is successful.The party also wants non-respondents and #Don#t Care# responses to be treated as void votes, and not to be considered negative responses, as with current practice.The motion states: This council has one of the most restrictive policies of any council in the North in regards to Irish Language Street Signage Policy.It adds: If we, as Elected Members, were held to the same standard as this policy in the Local Government elections, not one Member would have been ed to serve on this Council, as we would not have met those restrictive parameters.Sinn Fein councillor Ronan McLaughlin told the council: The move we are proposing would bring us in line with the vast majority of other councils, including Lisburn and Castlereagh. We#re not trying to change the parameters in which the petition for an Irish street sign is triggered. We are still clear it would require a majority for this to happen.He added: I don#t think any party around this chamber would put Irish language signage where it is not wanted.Meanwhile two streets in west Belfast are getting new Irish language signs at a cost of around £.

Over the decade-and-a-half, the industrial and shipbuilding legacy that once dominated the space within the city centre has gradually been stripped away, as commercial and tourism industries shape the planning and development of Belfast.While some of the most dramatic changes over the years have been the development of the docks in the city, there have also been signicant alterations to the Cathedral Quarter, Victoria Square and the Ulster University site among others.Clare Mulholland is a professor at the Queen#s University School of Natural and Built Environment. She explained that the pace of change in such a short period of time can be traced to a number of factors including the de-industrialisation of the city and the legacy of the Troubles.Since the Good Friday Agreement and in the last  to  years there has been huge changes in the city, but obviously the urban environment particularly, she explained.The city centre has become a shared space. The best comparison for the development of Belfast would maybe best be to somewhere like Sheffield and Bristol.Ours was more pronounced though because it was people fleeing the city and living where. The urban environment of Belfast changed because of the Troubles.The regeneration of the Cathedral Quarter changed what was previously a very local area into a vibrant part of the city.What can happen with those larger scale developments is that they have great potential to act as a catalyst in the community.While bright new buildings and hotels have popped up, Professor Mulholland does strike a cautionary note about the importance of adequate connection and ensuring Belfast meets future challenges, particularly around climate change. Going forward, she believes we should have an eye on how to ensure the city is sustainable.It depends on careful city planning to make sure the infrastructure is there, she added. There has to be a focus on building a connected city. One that is accessible, particularly by walking and cycling routes.One thing which could be really exciting for Belfast is Stormont declaring a climate emergency, which creates a focus on what is good for this city.I am a big believer that Belfast could be one of the most beautul cities in the world. It is a really beautul size in terms of everything being in walking distance.

In addition, , people are waiting to access psychological therapies. No patient is supposed to wait longer than thirteen weeks, however,  have done so - the longest wait recorded  weeks.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With  minutes gone in the second-half Claudy led by a point. With their defence beginning to get the upper hand the momentum was turning in their favour. Then everything changed. The Claudy bench asked referee Mickey McCarron for clarication on the scoreline. The reported - to - was instantly changed on the scoreboard to the officials - to -, in the Monaghan sides favour. googletag.cmd.push The winning margin was more than the two point swing and there was ample time for the Derry men to recover but the remaining theme of the story was of uncertainty. The young Claudy players lost their focus at a critical conjuncture and by the time Matthew Marrons nd minute penalty hit the net, their grip on the cup was almost gone. After the game, Brian Rainey hailed his sides spirit and although they battled back against the odds. For the most part, it was a terric contest between two well matched teams but Claudy will always look back on this game with regret. They will ponder how the game wouldve panned out had the score not been changed during their spell of dominance. googletag.cmd.push When you have team of young lads fighting for every inch of the game, they look up at the scoreboard and they have been docked two points, it is hard for those young cubs to take, Rainey commented after the game. Still, they battled on and still they gave everything. Unfortunately, that decision, which wasnt explained - I dont know how it happened or how it came about - I am just very frustrated that something like that can affect the game in such a way. Claudy carried the underdogs tag but a ninth minute goal from Niall McGonagle gave them the perfect confidence boost. Oisin Kearns-Madden won a kick-out and it was Tiarnan OConnors high ball that found McGonagle on the edge of the square before he slotted home. Matthew Marron, who finished with -, notched two early Blayney points but it was Claudy who held the upper hand and were full value for their - to - lead after  minutes. A mark, called by referee McCarron, saw Niall Rice reply for the Monaghan men who swtly scored again after McGonagle spilled a kick-out and Joseph McMahon passed to Rice for another score. An energised Castleblayney side were level though Marron before centre-back Liam Martin put them into the lead for the first time after  minutes. However, it was Claudy who finished the half strongly. McGonagle, who played at midfield for the second quarter, floated a perfect ball to OConnor who cleverly snaked inside the Blayney cover before firing to the roof of the net, helping his side go in at the break - to - ahead. Like he did at the start of the first-half, OConnor won the breaking ball from the throw-in but Claudys move broke down. It was Blayney who hit the first two scores of the second-half, from Rice and Marron. A touch of McGonagle magic from an acute angle saw him squeeze over a point before the Monaghan men hit the net. Dylan McKenna made the catch at midfield and at the end of the move, Rice raced clear. Despite the clutches of Ben Cooke, he blasted to the net, giving goalkeeper McCormick no chance. In the next play, Claudy almost found the net and couldve had a penalty. Adam Murphy passed to Niall Barr who squared the ball for the in-rushing Keelin Hasson who was impeded by goalkeeper McCully in the goalmouth. Play continued before Claudy were awarded a free in and Hasson was replaced with a head injury. McGonagles free tied the game once again. The Dungiven man then slotted over the bar, with a hint of goal on, and Claudy were back in the lead. Or so they thought. After the score was changed, Claudy were shell-shocked and Castleblayney took full advantage. Marron slotted home a penalty, with defenders Nathan and Zachary McArdle chipping in with points. McGonagle had a close range free blocked by a wall of Blayney players and OConnor saw a late shot blocked by keeper McCully as the brave Claudy fightback came up short.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

However, in recent years, the number of teams have fallen. Changes in society and working patterns are among some of the reasons put forward for the decline in teams. googletag.cmd.push However, the time has come for the organisers to decide whether they will continue on with the league. The DD committee say that unless they can register enough teams to form a league by February , the association will cease to exist.

The small group of volunteers who have been keeping the league alive for the past few years say that they have had enough. The league, known locally as the DD, has been one of the best local sporting organisations for many decades. It was set up in  and some of the top players in Ireland have played in the league. However, in recent years, the number of teams have fallen. Changes in society and working patterns are among some of the reasons put forward for the decline in teams. googletag.cmd.push However, the time has come for the organisers to decide whether they will continue on with the league. The DD committee say that unless they can register enough teams to form a league by February , the association will cease to exist. Match Secretary, Liam Smyth, described the situation as heartbreaking. “I have put everything into the DD and its soul destroying to be honest and it will be a real shame to see it go,” he said. In tomorrows Derry News, sports editor Gary Ferry speaks to long-standing members of the DD committee and reveals how much it will hurt them to see the demise of the league. googletag.cmd.push    If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

Other local issues highlighted included tackling litter , mental health , drug misuseand protecting the local environment . These were followed by building a bridge between Strangford and Portaferry .The results were detailed in a report written by Cormac, who said he was ldquodelighted to have been able to recognise the dedication of young volunteers across South Down in helping their peers have their voices heard.He added: ldquoOrganising Make Your Mark for the past two years has been a challenge each time but one which I enjoy greatly and am privileged to be faced with. Itrsquos now time for politicians and decision makers to act upon the issues raised by local young people.Cormacrsquos role in seeking out the opinions of his peers was praised by Baroness Ritchie, former South Down MP.She said: ldquoCongratulations are due to Cormac for his tenacity, ingenuity, hard work, enthusiasm and attention to detail. He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief.

It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child. We share that we are united by angels, which is our motto.John said that there are now over  men who have joined the club and he and Pat hope to welcome more throughout the year.The first match will be held at Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch on Friday, February  at pm. Men who have been affected by the loss of a child are invited to come along to spectate.Further details can be found on the Sands United County Down Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 In Demand.jpg","title":"Newcastle super gran loving life with ten grandchildren attending primary school  ","story":"MEET Newcastlersquos super gran Karen Cunningham.The  year-old is grandmother to ten pupils who all attend the townrsquos St Maryrsquos Primary School and nursery unit.The eight boys and two girls mdash who include a set of twins mdash are the sons and daughters of Karenrsquos three eldest children.While it may not be an official record, St Maryrsquos believe that this is the first time this has happened for as long as staff can recall.With a  week-old baby boy and another baby due in April, it looks like St Maryrsquos can rest assured of having one of Karenrsquos grandchildren at the school for the next decade at least.Karenrsquos son Andrew and his we Kristen have four children at St Maryrsquos mdash Reece in P, Keelie in P, Kai in P and Emie in nursery daughter Charlene Hamill and husband Dominic have four boys, Dara Hamill in P, twins Tiernan and Riley Hamill in P and Morgan Hamill in P and have a baby on the way daughter Kerrie-Louise Aspel and her partner Gary Kearney are parents to Nathan Kearney in P and Keegan Kearney in nursery school and  week-old Carly.While the mother of four, whose -year-old son Corey Madden still lives at home, admits to not always remembering the ages of her grandchildren, she could not be happier with her brood.ldquoMy grandchildren are the light of my le.

Elliersquos father Peter, brother-in-law Kieran and a neighbour were also quickly on the scene to help. Ellie sustained broken arms, legs, eye sockets, cheeks and teeth and had severe swelling on her brain.Due to the critical state of her injuries, the air ambulance was dispatched to the scene.When the medical team arrived at the family farm, they put Ellie into an induced coma to protect her brain ndash a procedure usually only done in a hospital environment.But, because the medical team includes both a doctor and a paramedic, they are able to carry out urgent medical care immediately at the scene.The air ambulance subsequently transported Ellie to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast where she spent eight weeks, two of which in a medically-induced coma.Her family had been told to prepare for the worst as the extent of her injuries left doctors unsure of whether she would ever be able to walk or talk again.Discharged from hospital on September  last year, Ellie is now back at school studying for her GCSEs with plans to pursue a career in medicine.Ellie said: ldquoI donrsquot remember much about that day.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10967245.jpg","title":"bandstand malcolm mcdowell","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to perform and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If they have any decency, Conor Murphy should be required to resign or be sacked.\"His comments follow a similar message on Twitter from DUP MLA Paul Frew, who is chairman of Mr Murphys Assembly scrutiny committee.\"The Quinn family have lived through a tortuous period of grief at the tragic loss  murder of their son compounded by the slur, alienated by the Republican movement. If the Quinn family say Conor Murphy should resign, he shouldnt have time to get his coat.\"That tweet was subsequently retweeted by fellow DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley.Mr Quinns parents Breege and Stephen have said Mr Murphys apology did not go far enough and have called on him to explicitly state that their son was not a criminal.Fianna Fail candidate Jim OCallaghan also called on Mr Murphy to resign over his controversial claims.Speaking in Dublin on Thursday, Mr OCallaghan said: \"Yes, I think Conor Murphy should resign.\"If his apology was genuine he would have issued it to the Quinn family  years ago.\"His apology was designed to protect and promote the interests of Sinn Fein in the run up to the General Election.\"What it reveals is that whenever there is a conflict between the chance of a family seeking justice on the one hand or people seeking justice on the one hand or the people in the provisional IRA or people involved in crime on the other hand, Sinn Fein always opts for the latter.\"try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementMan stabbed in face - PSNI deny tongue cut from mouth after gruesome image appears on social mediaStorm Ciara to batter NI with mph gales - weather warning upgraded to amber - possible impact on travel and electricity supplyBody of man found outside Antrim during search for missing Patrick Gibbons - post mortem to take placeThe funerals have taken place for the three McGinley children who were found leless at their west Dublin home last week        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"People\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"ni singers follow in footsteps of taylor swift and garth brooks  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
