(Picture: Cavendish)Fancy seeing the world via five-star luxury in Mexico, Bali and St Tropez?Why not be like Gweneth Lee, 47, and make your way from (five star) resort to (five star) resort by bedding unfaithful married men.She calculates her boyfriends have spent £100,000 in total funding her holidays, and she’s now hoping for more to add to her harem.‘Why pay for an expensive foreign holiday when you can get your lover to do so? That sums up my attitude,’ she said. ‘I’ve been doing more air miles than Richard Branson and loving every minute of it over the last year.’‘I worked out that I had travelled more than 50,000 miles for various liaisons with my lovers. I managed to join the Mile High Club on a private jet with one of my regulars – a wealthy shipping magnate.’She’s looking forward to more trips with married men this summer (Picture: Cavendish)‘But most of the time I travel on my own and link up with them at the hotel because they are meeting me in secret when they away on business trips.‘They will be in Silicon Valley near San Francisco on a work outing and they will jump on a quick flight and join me in Las Vegas. Or they will be meeting business contacts in Paris and then join me by the Mediterranean for a long weekend.‘I had one lover who insisted I shadowed the holiday he was having with his wife and children at Martha’s Vineyard near New York. So I stayed in a hotel ten miles down the road for the second week of their stay. He nipped over to my hotel for sex three days running by explaining that he was going on fishing trips.’Living the dream, eh?Gweneth on a luxury yacht in St Tropez (Picture: Cavendish)She insists on flying first class, naturally, funded by her BFs who include a jeweller, a stockbroker and a technology investor.Now 47-year old Miss Lee of Chelsea, West London is looking forward to packed summer of free trips on some of Europe’s finest beaches with other married men.‘I’m off to Marbella next month with an industrialist and then I’m going to Croatia with a gorgeous married man who owns health clubs.’Business consultant Miss Lee meets all her lovers through IllicitEncounters.com, a dating website for married people.She joined the site a decade ago after the death of her oil executive husband Robert and has had more than 100 affairs with married men since then.And one having cocktails in St Tropez (Picture: Cavendish)Spokesman Christian Grant claims Gweneth is ‘typical’ of many glamorous female members on the site.‘We find the spring and summer are among the busiest times of the year,’ he insists.‘There is nothing like a long holiday to make you realise you married the wrong person.‘That is when people come on to our site – looking for someone more exciting to enjoy the sunshine with.’Miss Lee said: ‘This was last June last year. I have been seeing a fabulously wealthy jeweller who has clients in all of Europe’s fashion capitals – Milan, Paris, London. He was on business in Paris and insisted I join him on the French Riviera which only is only an hour away from the capital by plane.‘We stayed on his private yacht – it was absolutely incredible. He had a staff of 20 people ready to cater for our every whim. He is married and loves his wife but she can’t keep up with him sexually and he really does have a girl in every port – he is insatiable!’Miss Lee said: ‘My lover has made a fortune investing in tech start-ups based in Silicon Valley around San Francisco. He was an early investor in Facebook, Uber and lots of other household names.‘He lives with his wife in London but spends a lot of time on the American West Coast. He was there for two weeks and insisted I join him in Vegas for a long weekend.‘He is a gambler so there was a lot time spent watching him playing the tables. It was a lot of fun. We stayed at the Wynn – the best hotel in Vegas.’Miss Lee said: ‘My lover made the mistake of marrying his teenage sweetheart. He’d got to his 40s and realised he didn’t want to spend the rest of his life sleeping with only one woman. I am one of several women he sees.‘He was in Hong Kong for business and asked me to join him in Bali on his way home. It was a long way to go but he made it worthwhile. We stayed at the Bulgari Resort which has to be seen to be believed.’Miss Lee said: ‘This was my most recent trip and was probably the best. We stayed at the Casa Malca – one of the finest hotels in the world. My lover was on a business trip to Wall Street in New York and joined me for a long weekend.‘He is devoted to his wife but she has gone off sex – that’s where I come in!’MORE: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle look happy and relaxed as the one month countdown to the royal wedding beginsMORE: New British blue passports will be made in France after firm drops appeal"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_8107763.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"already hotter yesterday sizzling spring kicks","story":"It’s already hotter than yesterday as sizzling spring kicks in (Picture: PA)Unless you’ve got a BBQ planned for this evening, cancel all your plans immediately and go outside. With temperatures hitting 26C, it’s already the hottest day of the year so far.And it’s only going to get hotter.According to Met Office forecaster Graham Madge, the mercury is expected to soar later today,He said: ‘We are not expecting that that is the maximum temperature – it will go higher than that.

What can you talk about to ensure that there are no awkward, staring-at-the-menu silences? And most importantly, how can you impress her enough to get a second date?It can feel like a complete gamble. But don’t panic – here are some stressbusting tips to help you make sure everything goes smoothly.We know, you want to be romantic and original. You don’t want to take her to a boring bar or restaurant, so you’re thinking of a mid-day picnic in the park. Perhaps a hike to a place you’ve never been before? Ice-cream on a rollercoaster?The whole point of first dates is that you’re getting to know a stranger – you have absolutely no idea what they like. At this point, you don’t want to suggest a quirky, offbeat date that they might not enjoy (besides, ants crawling all over the two of you on a blistering July day in the park is not exactly conducive to romance).No, no, there’s a reason the classics are classics.Take her to a restaurant and just talk. Order your signature drink, ask her if she wants to split a starter. Once you know her likes and dislikes better, you’re free to plan inventive dates.First dates can feel like a job interview, in the sense that you’re both trying to see if you’re a good match. You want to skillfully highlight your time spent doing charity work in Uruguay, your extensive knowledge of Russian literature, or your piano-playing ability.But that doesn’t exactly put people in the mood for romance. Take off your interview hat and relax, so you can put her at ease.Instead of talking, listen. Ask her simple questions: ‘What’s a typical weekend like for you? Ah, do you enjoy that? That must be difficult – tell me more?’Good listeners are rare enough to be impressive.Above all else, she wants to feel that you take an interest in her, and that she’s an interesting person. If you spend the entirety of the date lecturing her on all the wonderful things about yourself, she’s going to go home bored out of her skull – no matter how varied your CV is or how funny you try to be.Sure, that’s not how you’ve seen it on TV and movies. Onscreen, first dates are filled with sexy innuendo and knock-em-dead lines. But this can easily backfire, or come off cheesy, or (worst of all) leave her feeling uncomfortable – the kind of uncomfortable where she calls for the bill and texts her friends saying: ‘Oh god, complete disaster. He was being creepy and overtly sexual the entire night.’When in doubt, keep it subtle. Maybe lay off that filthy joke you heard around the office last Friday. Don’t go straight to the pick-up line you read in some men’s Internet forum.Do compliment her: ‘You look beautiful in that dress.’ A tasteful compliment does the heavy lifting –it lets her know that you’re attracted to her, without being OTT. Remember, you can always flirt outrageously later when you know more about her preferences.It’s natural to be curious about the other person’s relationship history, or their current status. You want to swap horror stories of online dating, or talk about dealbreakers. You might both be thinking: ‘Heshe is so great, why are they single?’All of that is fine. With one notable exception: Do not talk at length about your exes. There’s just no reason to do it on the first date, no matter what. Even if you thought they were ‘crazy’ because they keyed your car.Don’t talk about why you broke up with them, or do a post-mortem of that relationship. Don’t point out that your ex’s favourite band is playing in the bar. Don’t talk about them, period. This is a date between two people, not a therapy session with the ghost of your ex in attendance.Keep the ex references to zero – and if that’s tough, question why. If you can’t go on a date without bringing up Jenny who you loved four years ago…maybe you shouldn’t be dating.Okay, let’s skip ahead to the final five minutes of the evening. You’ve split the check after she refused to let you pay, you’re walking her to her car, and you feel so tense you can’t move. What do you do? Do you kiss her? Do you say goodbye? Do you do the stiff one-arm hug before disappearing?Relax. Watch her cues. If you’ve been flirting heavily for hours, it might be the propitious moment to lean in slightly and say ‘I’ve been thinking about kissing you the whole night.’Whatever you do, don’t lunge – it’s hugely offputting.If a kiss happens organically, fantastic. If not, don’t stress it. Handle any rejection with grace. It might not be the right time. Maybe it’ll happen on the second date, when you finally go on that picnic in the park.This is your chance to be polite and sweet. Tell her that you had a lovely time, and ask her to text you when she gets home safe. That way, she’s much more likely to say ‘Yes please’ when you text ‘Can we do this again?’MORE: How to avoid unintentionally being a d*ck to women in the street at nightMORE: How to compliment a woman without being a creepMORE: A guide to birdnesting, the hot new orce trend"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/610794096-e1523542866250.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"dogs really do resemble their owners but not in the way youd expect","story":"Who wouldn’t want to look like this cute doggo?

He added: ‘I feel I will live with this for the rest of my life.’Victim statements from the second man said he had been left in dire financial straits, had to take out pay day loans and spent some inheritance from his grandfather on his debts.He added: ‘I feel I can’t trust anyone and I’m paranoid I will be taken advantage of.‘The difficulties will remain with me for some time yet and may never go away.’Bain, who has now been jailed for six years, met one of his victims on wasteland in Newcastle while waiting for a male escort who failed to show up.Bain pretended to be the male prostitute and they walked away together.But then He said he was from anti-paedophile group Protectors of the North and told him ‘you are going to get caught, you are a paedo, a nonce’ before demanding cash.The victim gave him £200 and hoped that Bain would go away but he turned up at his house and demanded more money.Prosecutor Mark Giuliani told the court: ‘He said things would be put on the internet that would identify him as a homosexual man.‘He said to him he was going to put things online and in the Evening Chronicle, saying he was going to out him, he was going to say he was a paedo, a nonce, and f****t.’The court heard the victim had handed over a total of £1,260 when Bain turned up at his home again and demanded more money but this time the brave complainant refused to pay.Mr Giuliani said: ‘Having stood up to the defendant, the complainant went home and effectively broke down and told members of of his family what had been happening to him.‘He felt it necessary to inform his family he was, in fact, gay. He had to out himself.’The victim said in a statement he was ‘frightened and terrified’ during the ordeal and added: ‘I feel I will live with this for the rest of my life.’The court heard the second gay victim was convinced Bain was ‘also homosexual’ and initially freely handed over loans as their friendship grew, in the belief they would be paid back.As Bain’s requests for cash started to increase, he said he had a sick son and that they ‘needed money to travel to Scotland’, which made the victim feel sorry for him.The court heard when victim started to become reluctant to hand over more cash, Bain changed tactics.Mr Giuliani said: ‘He became more openly threatening, saying if he didn’t hand over money a gang called the Conroys could come calling for looking for him and smash up his home and car, saying he knew where his family lived and they would be hurt.’Bain even penned a letter, claiming to be ‘contract’ from one of the ‘Conroys’, saying money had to be handed over by 2pm as a ‘guarantee to be the end’.By the end of the man’s ordeal, Bain had pocketed £15,797.The court heard the victim’s credit score was badly effected by him having to find large cash sums and take out taking out high interest pay day loans.Bain, of Gateshead who has no fixed address, admitted two charges of blackmail as well as fraud and theft in relation to the second man.Bain also pleaded guilty to a fraud charge after taking £295 from a disabled man’s account, who had handed over a cash card in exchange for having his windows cleaned.Judge Simon Batiste sentenced Bain to six years behind bars and said his behaviour was ‘wicked’.The judge said: ‘Eventually, one man, went inside and told his family what was happening and the fact he was gay.‘As a result of this offence he, in fact, had to out himself to his family.’Rachel Hedworth, defending, said Bain has a long term drug habit, which is at the root of his long criminal record, and is ‘extremely remorseful’ for his actions.Miss Hedworth said Bain ‘pretended he was also homosexual’ and added: ‘He, in fact, led both of these men on to believe something would happen, that he would embark on a relationship with both of them in the first instance.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-455259480.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"rafael reveals bust louis van gaal led manchester united exit","story":"Louis van Gaal ended Rafael’s career at Manchester United.

It did catch me off guard.\u0027He added: \u0027She kissed me. She made the move. And I think I was like, OK – we\u0027re at that phase of our relationship right now, we\u0027re kissing. That was what happened.\u0027There were other kisses after that moment. She definitely made the first move and initiated the first act of affection in that way.\u0027Silverstein, who still lives in Los Angeles, said the duo had previously hugged and held hands but had never gone further until the actress, now 36, took matters into her own hands.Meghan later recounted the moment during a 2013 interview with Larry King, telling the veteran host: \u0027I was 13, it was a summer camp and I kissed him!\u0027Silverstein added: \u0027We had already become a couple. We had held hands prior - I\u0027ve always been affectionate, so we\u0027d already hugged. But the kiss was definitely her, her initiative absolutely.\u0027The teenage romance began after the pair met at a drama-focused summer camp organized by the Agape International Spiritual Center.Silverstein has grown up to be a star in the US as he is an actor, comedian and rapper who appears on The Late, Late Show.

Silverstein said that he believes Meghan will continue her activism work once she marries Prince Harry.

But what is GDPR?What is GDPR?The General Data Protection Regulation has been created over the course of four years in order to strengthen data protection in an era in which people are continuously giving social media websites permissions to use their personal information in exchange for ‘free’ services.GDPR will be replacing the Data Protection Act 1998, which itself was brought into law so that the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive could be implemented and give people more control over how organisations use data.The regulation also introduced penalties for those who do not comply with the new rules and in turn, suffer from data breaches. It also standardised all data laws across the European Union.A significant change in the new regulation is that if companies fail to provide adequate security to protect data, they could be fined heavily under GDPR.Why do we need GDPR?  The advent of the Internet and the emergence of the cloud led to organisations being able to use personal user data for their own purposes, which caused problems when iniduals wanted to know how their information was being used.  GDPR was planned because of the EU’s need to align data protection law with the 21st century, a time where people use free services like Amazon, Google, Twitter and Facebook and offer their information openly.Alongside this, the EU wanted to align data protection law across all member states so that companies are clear about what they need to comply with.          The General Data Protection Regulation will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member statesWhen will the GDPR be implemented?The GDPR  will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member states automatically, without the need for each country having to draw up their own legislation.While businesses have until May 25 to ensure they have applied the new rules, the directive came into force on May 24, 2016 after the EU agreed to the final text.Who does the GDPR apply to?GDPR will apply to those who decide how and why personal data is processed, the controllers, as well as those who actively process the data, otherwise known as the processors. This means that GDPR could apply to anyone working in a company, charity, government or IT firm.It will also apply to controllers and processors that are based outside the EU, but deal with data that belongs to EU residents. Controllers are responsible for ensuring that processors abide by the new law and process data lawfully, who themselves are required to maintain records of their activities.After the GDPR is put in place, data must be processed with consent and transparently, for a purpose and once it is no longer needed, data should be deleted. Alongside this, consent must be granted in an active fashion by the user, not passively with pre-ticked boxes.What is personal data?Under the GDPR, the European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other online identifiers such as IP addresses, mental health, cultural and economic information about an inidual.Iniduals already have the right to access information that a company has obtained and to know how and why their data is being processed, as well as who will see it. Data can also be rectified, changed or deleted at any time by the person it belongs to.          The European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other identifiersHow much are GDPR fines?When a data breach occurs, the people who are at risk of being affected must be told within 72 hours of the company being aware of it. Those who do not meet this deadline could face a penalty of two per cent of their annual worldwide revenue, or €10 million (£8.7m), whichever is higher.Then, the data protection authority should be contacted and in the UK, this means the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, or the ICO. The authority should be given information about the nature of data breach, how many people have been affected, what the consequences could be and what measures have been actioned.If people’s rights are ignored, the fine could reach up to €20 million (£17m) or four per cent of your global annual turnover, whichever is higher.Does Brexit affect GDPR?With Article 50 being triggered in March 2017, the UK has two years in which to leave the European Union, but this means that the GDPR will be implemented before this time. In August 2017, the UK government put forward a new Data Protection Bill, which replicates the requirements of GDPR ahead of Brexit. The new bill allows the ICO to issue fines of up to £17 million, or four per cent of global turnover, whichever is highest.Maniac: Everything

hit especially hard by the death of her last Welsh corgi Willow (who appeared in the Olympic opening ceremony with Daniel Craig), that had to be put to sleep at Windsor after suffering from cancer and other related illnessesLike all 30 of the corgis she has owned — and other royal pets including gundogs, labradors and cocker iels — Willow\u0027s time as part of the Queen\u0027s menagerie will be recorded in the traditional manner.It has been like this since 1959 when the death of Susan, the Queen\u0027s first corgi, given to her as a puppy on her 18th birthday by her father King George VI, was marked with a headstone.On it are engraved the dog\u0027s dates of birth and death along with the moving epitaph: \u0027For almost 15 years the faithful companion of the Queen.\u0027The same words appear on the gravestones of two of Susan\u0027s descendants, Sugar and Heather. And, because Willow is the last of the line, the 14th generation traced back to Susan, the elegy is likely to be just as heartfelt.There is only one unwritten rule — wherever possible, the animals are buried where they died, which means the final resting place of generations of the Royal Family\u0027s pets can be found at Windsor, Balmoral and Sandringham.These pet cemeteries have one thing in common: they are all in a secluded and peaceful spot with special resonance for the Queen.Willow is believed to have been interred close to Frogmore House, the royal retreat in Windsor Great Park where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will celebrate their wedding with a party on May 19.Other corgis have been buried closer to Windsor Castle, but Frogmore is where the Queen likes to walk, often with her dogs, far from any public access.          The death of Willow represents the final act in a story that began one spring day 85 years ago when the Queen\u0027s father — then Duke of York — brought home a Pembroke corgi called Dookie from kennels in SurreyBy far the largest animal cemetery is at Sandringham, in a tidy corner of the 20,000-acre estate, but within view of the royal residence.It was started by Queen Victoria for her collie Noble, who died in 1887, and it is where Susan was buried more than 70 years later.There are also memorial plaques set into a stone boundary wall that separates the cemetery from the rest of the estate.One commemorates Candy, Prince Philip\u0027s yellow labrador, who died in 1958. Another bears the name Sandringham Slipper, a black labrador who died in 1980 after eight years as a royal pet.Sandringham Brae, another black lab, is described as \u0027a gentleman amongst dogs\u0027 on his stone, while a roan cocker iel called Sandringham Fern is celebrated as a \u0027tireless worker and mischievous character\u0027.When Holly, the Queen\u0027s penultimate corgi, died at Balmoral 18 months ago, she directed that he must be buried in sight of the castle\u0027s drawing room windows.\u0027Even when they are no longer with her, the Queen likes to feel she is still surrounded by her corgis,\u0027 says a friend. \u0027That is why they are buried at all of her main private homes. They have been such a huge part of her life.\u0027The Queen is not, of course, without four-legged companionship now she still has her two dorgis — corgi-dachshund crosses Candy and Vulcan — along with a new addition to her canine family, Whisper, a corgi who used to be owned by a Sandringham gamekeeper.But the death of Willow represents the final act in a story that began one spring day 85 years ago when the Queen\u0027s father — then Duke of York — brought home a Pembroke corgi called Dookie from kennels in Surrey.In her 1983 biography of the Queen, Elizabeth R, the Countess of Longford wrote: \u00271933 was the year of the corgi.\u0027          At one stage there were said to be 13 corgis — memorably described by Princess Diana as a \u0027moving carpet\u0027 — lolling in the Queen\u0027s private sitting room, and nipping the heels of footmen, prime ministers, ladies-in-waiting and diplomats          Princess Elizabeth, then only seven, had fallen in love with a corgi she had played with in Hyde Park. It belonged to the family of Viscount Weymouth, a future Marquess of BathPrincess Elizabeth, then only seven, had fallen in love with a corgi she had played with in Hyde Park. It belonged to the family of Viscount Weymouth, a future Marquess of Bath.The breed was little known outside South Wales, but the young princess and her sister Margaret pleaded with their parents for one of their own.The Duke and Duchess of York needed little persuading and Mrs Thelma Gray, breeder of the Weymouths\u0027 dog and a pioneer of the breed, supplied the first royal corgi, Rozavel Golden Eagle — or Dookie, so-called by Mrs Gray because, she claimed, he acted \u0027aristocratically\u0027.Three years later Dookie acquired a wife called Jane but this royal marriage of convenience proved unproductive.Jane did produce two puppies with another mate, however, and Crackers and Carol joined King George and Queen Elizabeth\u0027s household during World War II.In 1944, Susan arrived as Princess Elizabeth\u0027s birthday present. Mistress and pet were inseparable. She even accompanied the Princess on her honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947, hidden from view under a blanket in the royal carriage.The following year, when the Princess gave birth to her first baby, Charles, newspaper columns were full of advice on how she could prevent Susan from becoming jealous of the infant prince.A year later, Susan followed her royal mistress into motherhood, producing a pair of puppies: Sugar, who belonged to Prince Charles, and Honey who, in later years, lived with the Queen Mother. It marked the beginning of a new royal dynasty.Over the years, the Queen became one of the most experienced breeders of Pembrokeshire corgis in the country. She always chose the sire herself, aiming for good-looking puppies that maintain the red colouring of the original Pembrokes.At one stage there were said to be 13 corgis — memorably described by Princess Diana as a \u0027moving carpet\u0027 — lolling in the Queen\u0027s private sitting room, and nipping the heels of footmen, prime ministers, ladies-in-waiting and diplomats.Every few years, a fresh litter arrived and older dogs passed away. No puppies were ever sold instead the Queen ensured that they went to good homes. Susan\u0027s descendants have gone to Australia and America.Then came the dorgis, a cross-breed resulting from an unplanned liaison between one of the Queen\u0027s corgis and Princess Margaret\u0027s dachshund Pipkin.In 2009, it emerged that the Queen had stopped breeding the dogs. It was perhaps the first public sign that our monarch was growing old.She worried about puppies and lively young dogs around her feet, and the fear that she might trip over, hurting herself or them. But what was not clear then was that she no longer wanted any new four-legged companions to replace those that died.Then, three years ago Monty Roberts, the Californian cowboy who inspired the Hollywood film The Horse Whisperer, disclosed what many had suspected: the Queen, who will be 92 on Saturday, did not wish to leave any of her beloved pets after her death. Corgis have an average life of 12 to 13 years, though some can reach 18. Willow was just a few weeks short of her 15th birthday.Inevitably, perhaps, it took a plain-speaking American to give this first intimation of the Queen\u0027s sense of her own mortality.Roberts — after whom the Queen named Monty, one of the corgis that appeared in the James Bond spoof she made with actor Daniel Craig for the London Olympics — was an informal adviser to her on horses and dogs for more than 25 years.He said that when Monty died in 2012, he offered to find the Queen a replacement puppy. \u0027But she didn\u0027t want to have any more young dogs. She didn\u0027t want to leave any young dog behind. I understood we would discuss it further at a later date.\u0027Well, we never did, and I have no right to try to force her into continuing to bring on young puppies if she doesn\u0027t want to.\u0027          Often the dogs are taken to the Queen\u0027s private sitting room when she is having breakfast, and clamour for scraps, slices of toast and marmalade, fed to them from the tableFor now, life for Candy, Vulcan and Whisper will continue as usual. Each day starts with a brisk walk with a footman in the Buckingham Palace gardens and, because of their age, they are relatively easy to handle. The days when former royal butler Paul Burrell, then a Palace page, was knocked unconscious when nine leashed corgis pulled him over on the steps of Sandringham House are long past.When their mistress is at the Palace, the dogs sleep in raised wicker baskets in a boot room near the royal apartments, through which they are at liberty to wander.Often the dogs are taken to the Queen\u0027s private sitting room when she is having breakfast, and clamour for scraps, slices of toast and marmalade, fed to them from the table.Whenever possible, the Queen feeds the corgis herself — their menu includes steak, poached chicken, liver and rabbit.According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, who spent 11 years in the Palace kitchen, the corgis had a \u0027wonderful diet. One day it might be chuck steak, boiled and diced and served with finely chopped boiled cabbage and white rice. The next they\u0027d have poached chicken or liver. Or rabbits shot by William and Harry which we\u0027d clean and cook\u0027.Kate and Wills WON\u0027T know if they are having a boy or a girl...South Korean kills and COOKS his neighbour\u0027s dog then...Kate Middleton and Prince William launch Royal Baby webpage In over his head!

Prince Philip has referred to this as her \u0027dog mechanism\u0027 therapy.And she is very hands-on with their personal maintenance, de-fleaing them and administering medicine. Nothing is too much trouble. When she is being fitted for a new dress, the Queen produces a special magnet to pick up pins to ensure the dogs do not prick their paws.No world figure has been as identified with an animal as the Queen has with her corgis.Over the years they have brought a warmth to her public image, being photographed at her side receiving statesmen in formal situations, or on a tartan picnic rug with the Royal Family at Balmoral, or being bundled by a flunky up the steps on to a royal plane.In a life governed by protocol, they are also a simple way to break the ice with strangers. The line may now have ended, but Willow, like each and every one of her corgis, will be remembered.Reacting to news of Willow\u0027s death yesterday one royal fan, Angela Cox, recalled visiting Sandringham just after the Queen had been there.In a tweet she said: \u0027There was a small posy on each of her dogs\u0027 graves. It made me cry.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/22/4B4B223C00000578-5631741-image-a-13_1524086711879.jpg","title":"Is Britains magnificent magnolia picture better one win 500","story":"    This magnificent magnolia was photographed in Kew Garden in London earlier today as temperatures soared           To enter the competition you need to be a UK resident aged 18 or over and have taken the photograph this yearWhile some blossoms are now at their best and others are still to thrill, Radio 4’s John Humphrys remarked sadly yesterday that all the petals on the specimen in his London garden have already dropped. Despite becoming a fixture in Britain, the trees have strong French ties, having been named in the 18th century after botanist Pierre Magnol.

She might have been a relative. ‘It wasn’t until I saw the news that I realised Dale had died. It’s a shame as he seemed a nice man. I recognised him from the television\u0027. Dale started his career in local radio and had little work for eight years until he spent nearly a decade hosting Supermarket Sweep before fronting the National Lottery show In It To Win It on BBC1 for 14 years and the Pick of the Pops show on BBC Radio 2 for ten years.But the star, known for his sunny disposition, bright smile and tan, disappeared from public life two years ago admitting he ‘wouldn’t leave the house’ because of depression and regrets that he had failed to admit he was gay until he was 45.A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders. But this year he relaunched his career with a US travel show on Channel 5 called Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive.  Last night Winton\u0027s agent confirmed his death at home at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious. He adored being in show business \u0026amp loved meeting fans. He devoted his life to making everyone else happy, his friends, the public \u0026amp his godsons, even though he found it hard to be happy himself. I pray he has found peace\u0027. In June 2016, two months before he was last seen in public, he said: \u0027I would not leave the house for five years. I didn’t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, “I want to withdraw.\u0027A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027Comedian David Walliams also said he was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to hear of the death of his friend, who spoke openly about his battle with depression two years ago.But describing how much fun he was to be around he said: \u0027One night Dale \u0026amp I were going out to dinner \u0026amp he stopped off on the way to buy diet lemonade from a corner shop. He was in there about 20 minutes. When he finally got back in the car I asked ‘what took you so long?’ \u0026amp he said ‘sorry David I am very big with the Indian community!’In another anecdote he said: \u0027One afternoon Dale \u0026amp I were out shopping \u0026amp some policeman were standing on the street corner. He gave them a huge wave \u0026amp called out ‘hello loves, hello darlings!’ I asked why he was saying hello. He replied ‘always wave at policemen David. You never know when you might need one!’ Winton was a household name in the mid 1990s and early 2000s while fronting shows like Supermarket Sweep and The National Lottery: In It To Win It, but had kept a low profile in recent years.   He was born in Marylebone,London, in May 1955 to Gary and Sheree, an actress.Writing in his autobiography, Dale Winton: My Story, in 2002, the much loved star touchingly described his relationship with his beloved mother.\u0027In truth though, I always felt my Mum would forgive me anything. She believed in boundaries and was strict, but her love for me was real and unconditional.\u0027  Mr Winton left his Marylebone flat (pictured today) three weeks ago but died on Wednesday at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given          Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive - Ep 4 - Dale and biker Carl at a Harley Davidson biker rally before Dale has a ride on the Harley - it would be one of the very last shows he would ever make  Pals: Davina, pictured with the late star in 1998, counted herself among his many showbiz palsPrecious moment gorilla kisses her baby seconds after birthTV legend dies: Fan favourite Dale Winton in his top TV showsCCTV shows schoolgirl hiding from men with baseball batsFed-up farmer puts up sign to warn off his complaining neighboursDramatic chatter between Southwest flight 1380 pilot and ATCShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeGreat white shark circles father and his sons before BITING boatNail-biting CCTV shows schoolgirl hiding from gang behind low wallPolice threaten to crush vehicles of those caught \u0027hare coursing\u0027Experience the sights and sounds of New York City in 1911Tail between its legs!

He said that was the point he should have said, \u0027Mum, I\u0027ll tell you: I\u0027m gay\u0027.  In recent years the once prolific star disappeared from TV screens and in an interview earlier this year he claimed he was keeping a low profile after undergoing several rounds of surgery.In 2015 he sparked concern after failing to attend the funeral of Cilla Black, who was one of his closest friends.A year later, he appeared on TV\u0027s Loose Women and revealed he had been secretly battling depression after going through a difficult break up.He told the show: \u0027I should have taken myself off the TV but I didn\u0027t.

Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!\u0027 Pompeo has been paving the way for an expected meeting between Trump and Kim.The CIA director has a close relationship with the president, unlike former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who Trump fired last month in a tweet a few days after agreeing to an invitation from Kim to meet. Trump immediately tapped Pompeo to replace Tillerson. At a confirmation hearing last week that would have taken place after his trip to Pyongyang, Pompeo told senators on the Foreign Relations Committee that he was \u0027optimistic that the United States government can set the conditions for that appropriately so that the president and the North Korean leader\u0027 can have a conversation that \u0027will set us down the course of achieving a diplomatic outcome that...America and the world so desperately need.\u0027Referring to the testimony on Wednesday, Sen. Bob Menendez, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, scolded Pompeo for not being forthright with him even in their private talks about his Easter weekend tete-a-tete with Kim. \u0027After committing to transparency in his opening statement, he was not forthcoming when I questioned him about his involvement in the Russia investigation and I can tell you even his private conversations with me he didn\u0027t tell me about his visit to North Korea,\u0027 Menendez said at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event in Washington. The president confirmed Tuesday that a face-to-face meeting between himself and Kim was still on track to take place in the next few weeks.\u0027I look forward to meeting with Kim Jong-un. And hopefully that will be a success. And maybe it will be, and maybe it won\u0027t be. We don\u0027t know,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027But I can say this: They do respect us. We are respectful of them. And we\u0027re going to see what happens.\u0027Unless negotiations go offer the rails, Trump said the talk wold take place in late May or early June in one of five undisclosed locations he said are under consideration.\u0027We have had direct talks at very high levels, extremely high levels, with North Korea. And I really believe there\u0027s a lot of good will,\u0027 the U.S. president said. \u0027As I always say, we\u0027ll see what happens. Because ultimately, it\u0027s the end result that counts.\u0027Locations under discussion were thought to include Beijing, Geneva and Panmunjom, a city inside the Demilitarized Zone. Sweden has also offered to assist with a meeting, and Mongolia\u0027s former president recommended his country\u0027s summit city, Ulaanbaatar. Trump said Washington had been ruled out, affirming experts\u0027 expectations that the meeting would not take place on either of the leaders\u0027 home turf.   US President Donald Trump greets Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he arrives for talks at Trump\u0027s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday          DEATH GRIP: President Trump yanked Abe in for one of his famous locked and loaded handshakes           Trump said during the joint appearance that the U.S. and Japan \u0027are locked and we are very unified\u0027 in their approach to North KoreaTrump commented on the scheduled talks with Kim on Tuesday as he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago for a two-day summit.Trump said Japan and the U.S. are \u0027locked and we are very unified\u0027 when it comes to North Korea.  He delivered the remarks after welcoming Abe to his Palm Beach property for an afternoon meeting that both he and the Japanese leader said yielded great progress on the trade and security issues at hand.\u0027On those two points, we actually successfully forged a mutual understanding,\u0027 Abe said. \u0027So I\u0027m very happy to see the outcome of our one-on-one discussion.\u0027     Abe commended Trump on Tuesday for having the \u0027courage\u0027 to meet with Kim.  Still, he said he wanted to \u0027underscore the importance of achieving the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization, as well as the abandonment of missile programs of North Korea\u0027 in their talks.           US President Donald Trump greets Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he arrives for talks at Trump\u0027s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach on Tuesday          Conversation today with Abe centered on global security and trade will pick back up Thursday and apex with a joint press conference.

Tree pollens tend to be most active from March to May and weed pollens from early spring to early autumn.Symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes.                                                     DEFRA guidance for high air pollution said: \u0027Adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors.\u0027People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.\u0027Older people should also reduce physical exertion.\u0027Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.\u0027Around 29,000 Britons are killed annually by air pollution - 15 times more than the 2,000 who die in road accidents - Department of Health-backed research shows.With temperatures expected to hit a scorching 80F, the bookies have slashed the odds into just 14 that Thursday notches up the highest temperature of 2018. And the scissors have also been taken to the price that a whopping 86F (30C) is reached (64) anywhere in UK. It\u0027s also now a 65 shot that despite its sodden start, this April takes home the accolade as being the warmest ever. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: \u0027The gorgeous weather has got us feeling flush and we\u0027ve been forced to slash the odds of the sunshine sticking around. \u0027Bosses ought to expect workers to be pulling sickies left, right and center this week as the mercury rises.\u0027 Supermarket chiefs are stockpiling beer, cider and sun cream as the min-heatwave sweeps in.Sainsbury\u0027s predict a 300 per cent rise in demand for sun cream and a 100 per cent increase in sales of fake tan over the next couple of days – so punters can look ready-bronzed in the sunshine.They also estimate 70 per cent more sales of beer and cider, a 30 per cent uplift in Rosé wine and a 150 per cent increase in demand for ice cream.And as the BBQ gets dusted down for the first time this year, the supermarket believes sales of vegan and vegetarian food will soar by 130 per cent.A Sainsbury\u0027s spokesperson said: \u0027It seems the whole country has been eagerly awaiting the warmer weather, and we\u0027re expecting our customers to celebrate the return of sunshine by bronzing with fake tan, cooling down with ice cream and firing up the barbecue.\u0027 The high temperatures will not just be confined to one part of the country, with 68F-70F (20C-21C)  expected in Newcastle, 64F-66F (18C-19C) in Northern Ireland and 63F (17C) in Glasgow.Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: \u0027It\u0027s going to be a pretty nice day - it will be a slow start in places with cloud first thing.\u0027But by mid-afternoon there will be lots of unbroken sunshine.\u0027Thursday could see even higher temperatures - 77-80F  (25C-27C) in the South East - as warm air continues to come up through Spain and on to the UK.Saturday could see isolated showers in parts, while there is \u0027uncertainty\u0027 about what Sunday\u0027s weather will bring.Experts predict these warm conditions are likely to last for the rest of the month, with changeable conditions continuing in the northwest, while the southeast still has some decent dry and bright spells.Toasty temperatures will even be higher than those in Malibu, Athens and Rome. The start of the week should see warm weather in the south and the east, but the north and west have a high risk of rain and wind.The southeast can expect the best conditions in the country with the northwest seeing the bleakest.The African plume differs to the Spanish plume the UK experienced last summer which brought with it temperatures of 77F (25C). A Spanish plume is caused by cool Atlantic air being pushed towards Spain, which in turn pushes warm Spanish air towards the UK, bringing with it hot humid weather.   Get ready for two weeks of sun!

Although Copperfield (left in court yesterday) said it might be his fault if an audience volunteer who was participating in an illusion got hurt, the celebrated magician didn\u0027t acknowledge responsibility for injuries Gavin Cox (right) claims to have suffered when he fell      The illusionist (pictured in court on Wednesday) said he passed through the same outdoor alley alone while performing another illusion about 10 minutes earlier, and didn\u0027t notice any debris  The 61-year-old performer is due to return to the witness stand next Tuesday for more testimony in Clark County District Court Copperfield said he didn\u0027t know whether there as a powdery residue near a trash bin in an MGM Grand alley. He said he passed through the same outdoor alley alone while performing another illusion about 10 minutes earlier, and didn\u0027t notice any debris.\u0027If in fact there was construction dust, could that be your fault if someone fell and got hurt?\u0027 Morelli asked.Copperfield responded that he couldn\u0027t answer a hypothetical question before proceedings ended for the day.Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid giving away performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of the illusionist\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors. The performer is due to return to the witness stand next Tuesday for more testimony in Clark County District Court.          Gavin Cox (pictured) was overcome with emotion as opening statements were made in the case. He claims that on returning to Britain after taking part in the trick, he suffered chronic pain while a scan showed a lesion on his brain.He said Copperfield\u0027s assistants hurried him down a secret passage, through a door and outside into the open air. He said: \u0027It was like a fire alarm went off. They were saying Hurry! Run, run, run!\u0027It was total pandemonium. You don’t know where you are going. It’s dark. There are hands pushing you on your back. As I went around a corner, my feet slipped from underneath me and I hit the ground.\u0027Mr Cox says he fell as he ran around the side of the theater.In the interview, he said that he as now forced to wear an oxygen \u0027lung\u0027 at night because he stops breathing, and he spent three months in a Californian brain trauma centre. The couple claimed they had been forced to live in the US for years as the case dragged on.Mrs Cox said in 2016: \u0027We are too broke to go out and Gavin’s injuries prevent us from enjoying a normal life. Gavin once cooked for royalty but now he can’t even bake a muffin because he has nerve damage in his hands and no sense of smell.\u0027 Mr Cox said he blacked out after his fall but remembers the audience cheering at the end of the trick. An ambulance later took Mr Cox to hospital where his right shoulder was found to be dislocated.Two days later he filled out an accident report at MGM and hired a US personal injury lawyer.  Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid disclosing performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of Copperfield\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors Once back in Britain, Mr Cox said he began to suffer chronic pain, headaches and confusion. A scan would later show lesions on his brain. But Mrs Cox said NHS waiting lists were ‘too long and he needed immediate treatment’.So the couple returned to Vegas in February 2014. Their travel insurer refused to pay for ongoing treatment, but they were seen under a \u0027medical lien\u0027 – doctors agreed to treat Mr Cox and receive payment only when the lawsuit is settled.Mr Cox\u0027s career had once included years as a chef at London’s Buck’s Club, where he cooked for the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and Dracula actor Christopher Lee, and running a guesthouse in Broadstairs, Kent. But he said in the interview that he has been unable to work since the accident.Having had multiple operations on his back and neck, he said he had been diagnosed with permanent brain damage and a form of Parkinson’s. The Coxes were forced to sell their guesthouse for £515,000 at the end of 2014 and had been living off their savings. At the time of the interview, the Mail On Sunday quoted Copperfield’s lawyers as saying they denied all allegations but could not comment further due to ongoing litigation.They added: ‘This illusion has been performed for more than 15 years and with more than 100,000 participants.

But police believe he assaulted at least 105 between 2002 and 2008. The Parole Board made its decision while taking into account his 19 convictions, and not the 100 or more offences he is suspected of carrying out.

I accept responsibility, so I’m not hiding behind my advisers. It’s my responsibility entirely.\u0027The Justice Secretary refused to block the parole board decision as outrage mounted and instead waited for victims to launch a legal challenge.He added: \u0027I felt it ­sensible to take advice from a top barrister and I interrogated that advice and concluded it was right I don’t take the action.\u0027I was pleased it was successful and Worboys remains behind bars — I didn’t want Worboys released.

She later died of blunt force trauma to her head, neck and torso.Captain Shults calmly relayed details about the crisis to air traffic controllers, and passengers commended her handling of the situation. Friends at Mrs Shults\u0027 church in Boerne, Texas, about 30 miles northwest of San Antonio, said they were not surprised after listening to the recording and reading media reports about her actions.\u0027Everybody is talking about Tammie Jo and how cool and calm she was in a crisis, and that\u0027s just Tammie Jo,\u0027 Rachel Russo said. \u0027That\u0027s how she\u0027s wired.\u0027     A U.S. NTSB investigator is on scene examining damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane in this image released from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania          Investigators examining the damaged engine of Southwest Airlines flight 1380 after it exploded in flight sending shrapnel into the fuselage, breaking a window and causing the plane to make an emergency landing Veteran Navy combat aviator Linda Maloney said that she and Mrs Shults were among a small group of women who worked to see the combat exclusion rule repealed.\u0027Obviously it was frustrating,\u0027 said Ms Maloney, who became among the first women to join a combat military flying squadron and was deployed to the Arabian Gulf. \u0027We go through the same training that the guys do, and our hope was the Navy would allow us to fly in combat at some point.\u0027Mrs Shults was featured in Maloney\u0027s book Military Fly Moms along with the stories and photos of 69 other women US military veterans.Ms Russo and Staci Thompson, who has known Mrs Shults for about 20 years and was nanny to her two children when they were small, said she \u0027loved\u0027 her military career but has alluded to frustrations and challenges that came with it.They also said she embraced those experiences to make her stronger and guide her into a role as a mentor to young female pilots or girls thinking about a military career.\u0027She learned a lot about overcoming things as a woman in a male-dominated field,\u0027 Ms Russo said.Mrs Shults is from New Mexico, according to a personnel file from the Navy, and was a 1983 graduate of MidAmerica Nazarene University in Olathe, Kansas, where she earned degrees in biology and agribusiness.Mrs Shults\u0027 brother-in-law, Gary Shults, said her husband also is a Southwest pilot and told him she made the emergency landing.\u0027She\u0027s a formidable woman, as sharp as a tack,\u0027 said Gary Shults, a dentist in San Antonio. \u0027My brother says she\u0027s the best pilot he knows.\u0027Hero pilot who landed Southwest plane was once turned down by the Air Force"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/12/4B48D54A00000578-5633307-image-a-16_1524137758623.jpg","title":"NONE passengers pictured Southwest flight 1380 wearing oxygen masks correctly","story":"    Incorrect: Aviation experts have pointed out that the Soutwhest Flight 1308 passengers pictured in this image are not wearing their oxygen masks correctly.

the first fatal incident in US commercial aviation for nearly a decade. The Boeing 737-700 took off without incident but minutes into the flight, passengers heard an explosion in the left engine, which sent shrapnel flying through the window, shattering the glass and leading oxygen masks to drop.     Terrifying images shot from on board show the carcass of the ruined aircraft engine which malfunctioned mid-airJennifer  was nearly drawn out of the window which was next to her seat and had to be pulled back into her seat by other passengers.After the plane made a rushed emergency landing - she was taken to hospital for emergency treatment but later died.Seven other passengers were also treated for injuries, although it is unclear as yet whether any were suffering the effects of hypoxia or carbon monoxide poisoning. Marty Martinez, 29, began filming in selfie mode in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Martinez, who runs a Dallas marketing agency, said on Wednesday he wanted to communicate with loved ones, but many social media users attacked him in expletive-laced postings. The hero captain of the plane insists she was just doing her job after safely performing an emergency landing amid the crisis unfolding on board.Tammie Jo Shults showed \u0027nerves of steel\u0027 and kept calm even as she told air traffic officials that a passenger, Jennifer Riordan, had almost been sucked out of the depressurized cabin of the Dallas-bound Boeing 737.But in a statement a day after the mid-air drama, the 56-year-old and First Officer Darren Ellisor said: \u0027We all feel we were simply doing our jobs\u0027.\u0027On behalf of the entire Crew, we appreciate the outpouring of support from the public and our coworkers as we all reflect on one family\u0027s profound loss,\u0027 the two pilots said, adding that their \u0027hearts are heavy\u0027.It comes as it emerged that Shults was once turned down by the Air Force and had even been warned at a high school careers fair that \u0027there were no professional women pilots\u0027. Instead, Mrs Shults was commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and reached the rank of lieutenant commander, said Commander Ron Flanders, the spokesman for Naval Air Forces in San Diego.Women aviators were excluded from combat missions until the month after Mrs Shults got off active duty in March 1993, but Mr Flanders said Mrs Shults flew during Operation Desert Storm trainings as an aggressor enemy pilot.           Jennifer Riordan, 43, was the only person killed on the flight after a piece of shrapnel punctured the window next to her          Tragic images show where Ms Riordan was nearly sucked out of the open window and had to be pulled back in by passengers          A piece of the engine casing discovered by startled residents at the Heidelberg Country Club in Bernville, PA, approximately 60 miles from the landing site          Officials from the FBI have been called in to help investigate the cause of the incident and could be seen helping wrap up the evidenceSouthwest Airlines passenger, 29, trolled for LIVE STREAMING emergency landing | Daily Mail Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/09/4B4EB48900000578-0-image-m-21_1524125221116.jpg","title":"Baffled cat transfixed flame birthday candle","story":"This adorable cat was treated to a delightful red cake for its second birthdayAfter some deliberation the feline climbed towards the birthday cake. Yet the curious cat was hesitant to engage with the flame and so at first it simply waved its paw near the light.But then suddenly it swiped at the burning candle and managed to ‘blow’ out the flame.The video was captured on March 29 this year.Passerby shoves policeman off his motorbike and into the...Go way back in the Big Apple!

dubbed Alfie\u0027s Army - who are demanding he be released from hospital - of taking advantage of the family\u0027s grief. The consultant paediatrician, from the Countess of Chester Hospital, told Radio Five Live: \u0027What amazed me is what\u0027s going on outside Alder Hey.\u0027I\u0027m sure everybody out there feels they have Alfie\u0027s best interests at heart but comments being made that the doctors and nurses are somehow murderers?\u0027What we\u0027re seeing at Alder Hey is a wider reflection of what\u0027s going on in the world at large.          There has been a number of protests outside the hospital in Liverpool in support of the youngster\u0027s family          Dr Jayaram has accused protestors - dubbed Alfie\u0027s Army - who are demanding he be released from hospital - of taking advantage of the family\u0027s grief\u0027There\u0027s this lack of trust of people perceived to be in authority or establishment. Some of the comments are terrifying.\u0027Do these people genuinely think that children\u0027s doctors and nurses are deliberately lying and going out of their way to do harm?\u0027How the hell has it come to this in 2018?\u0027Remember the best interests and well-being of the child are paramount - not the doctors, the nurses, not even the family and certainly not the baying mob.

Dr Jayaram said he had \u0027no sympathy\u0027 for \u0027all the mob jumping on the bandwagon\u0027          Merseyside Police called for protesters to respect the safety of staff and patients at the hospital          Alfie is said to be in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition\u0027You\u0027re just taking advantage of a family\u0027s grief and not allowing them to have any kind of opportunity for moving on with the process of grieving.\u0027I\u0027m fully prepared for abuse to be hurled back at me by saying this in public but it needs to be said.\u0027Dr Jayaram said there was a debate around at what point Alfie should receive end-of-life care or whether treatment should continue in the hope of improvement.Explaining why Alfie\u0027s parents should not be allowed to take him to Rome, he said in the radio interview yesterday: \u0027The issue is that in UK law, doctors, nurses, health professionals have to act in the best interests of the child, not the parents, not themselves, not anybody else.          Earlier this week Mr Evans met the Pope to plead for more help to save his brain damaged son\u0027And the difficulty here is if the chance of any long term improvement is virtually nil then by actually putting Alfie at potential risk, because there are huge risks in transporting a critically ill babies.\u0027It\u0027s a question of dignity. It puts him at higher risk of dying.\u0027I can understand, as a parent myself, you want to cling on to any straw floating by in the sea to stop you from drowning.\u0027Dr Jayaram compared the case to that of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard last year whose parents were denied the right to take him to America for experimental treatment following court rulings.          Posting photos of himself kissing Pope Francis\u0027s hand, Mr Evans wrote: \u0027Your holiness save our son\u0027He said: \u0027Alfie has a condition that falls into the group of conditions called neurodegenerative conditions.\u0027Some of these have names and some have not got specific names.\u0027This is an important point because one of the arguments being put forward is that there isn\u0027t a diagnosis, there isn\u0027t a name to this neurodegenerative condition.\u0027But people know what it is and we know that the outlook is grim. The brain gradually effectively just dies away.\u0027Alfie\u0027s parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, from Liverpool, have lost fights in the high court, court of appeal, supreme court and European court of human rights (ECHR).They say \u0027the state\u0027 is wrongly interfering with their parental choice and want to move their 23-month-old son to a hospital in Rome for further treatment.Earlier this week Mr Evans met the Pope to plead for more help to save his brain damaged son after flying into Rome last night.He had a 20 minute private audience at the Vatican where the Pontiff agreed to ramp up the campaign to stop his life support being switched off.Posting photos of himself kissing Pope Francis\u0027s hand, Mr Evans wrote: \u0027Your holiness save our son.\u0027 Born on May 9 last year, Alfie is said to be in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition.Specialists at Alder Hey say life-support treatment should stop and judges have accepted evidence that shows further treatment would be futile.On Tuesday Mr Evans asked \u0027Alfie\u0027s Army\u0027 supporters to calm down and quit protesting for a while so they can enjoy time with their son in peace.He said: \u0027Can I ask that after tonight I would really appreciate if everyone has a break from the protesting please?\u0027Me and Kate need to focus on spending precious time with Alfie and focus on the next legal step, keeping the relationship with the staff at ease and peace and make sure no parents are being affected any more.\u0027Earlier this week Merseyside Police called for protesters to respect the safety of staff and patients at the hospital.Chief inspector Chris Gibson said: \u0027While many people have gathered to protest in a peaceful way, Merseyside Police is now investigating a small number of reports, some of which originate from social media, as well as instances of verbal abuse and acts of intimidation from those outside the hospital..\u0027This is extremely unhelpful for all concerned and we are investigating further to establish the full circumstances.\u0027They also expressed \u0027dismay\u0027 and \u0027concern\u0027 over reports supporters of Alfie\u0027s family had gone in to the paediatric intensive care unit at the hospital..An Alder Hey spokesperson said: \u0027We hope that staff will be allowed to continue caring for Alfie and all other children at Alder Hey without interference or disturbance.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/12/4B4E925C00000578-0-image-a-77_1524136882394.jpg","title":"Lion looks adopted hipster hairstyle","story":"    Who\u0027s a pretty boy?

And, because Willow is the last of the line, the 14th generation traced back to Susan, the elegy is likely to be just as heartfelt.There is only one unwritten rule — wherever possible, the animals are buried where they died, which means the final resting place of generations of the Royal Family\u0027s pets can be found at Windsor, Balmoral and Sandringham.These pet cemeteries have one thing in common: they are all in a secluded and peaceful spot with special resonance for the Queen.Willow is believed to have been interred close to Frogmore House, the royal retreat in Windsor Great Park where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will celebrate their wedding with a party on May 19.Other corgis have been buried closer to Windsor Castle, but Frogmore is where the Queen likes to walk, often with her dogs, far from any public access.          The death of Willow represents the final act in a story that began one spring day 85 years ago when the Queen\u0027s father — then Duke of York — brought home a Pembroke corgi called Dookie from kennels in SurreyBy far the largest animal cemetery is at Sandringham, in a tidy corner of the 20,000-acre estate, but within view of the royal residence.It was started by Queen Victoria for her collie Noble, who died in 1887, and it is where Susan was buried more than 70 years later.There are also memorial plaques set into a stone boundary wall that separates the cemetery from the rest of the estate.One commemorates Candy, Prince Philip\u0027s yellow labrador, who died in 1958. Another bears the name Sandringham Slipper, a black labrador who died in 1980 after eight years as a royal pet.Sandringham Brae, another black lab, is described as \u0027a gentleman amongst dogs\u0027 on his stone, while a roan cocker iel called Sandringham Fern is celebrated as a \u0027tireless worker and mischievous character\u0027.When Holly, the Queen\u0027s penultimate corgi, died at Balmoral 18 months ago, she directed that he must be buried in sight of the castle\u0027s drawing room windows.\u0027Even when they are no longer with her, the Queen likes to feel she is still surrounded by her corgis,\u0027 says a friend. \u0027That is why they are buried at all of her main private homes. They have been such a huge part of her life.\u0027The Queen is not, of course, without four-legged companionship now she still has her two dorgis — corgi-dachshund crosses Candy and Vulcan — along with a new addition to her canine family, Whisper, a corgi who used to be owned by a Sandringham gamekeeper.But the death of Willow represents the final act in a story that began one spring day 85 years ago when the Queen\u0027s father — then Duke of York — brought home a Pembroke corgi called Dookie from kennels in Surrey.In her 1983 biography of the Queen, Elizabeth R, the Countess of Longford wrote: \u00271933 was the year of the corgi.\u0027          At one stage there were said to be 13 corgis — memorably described by Princess Diana as a \u0027moving carpet\u0027 — lolling in the Queen\u0027s private sitting room, and nipping the heels of footmen, prime ministers, ladies-in-waiting and diplomats          Princess Elizabeth, then only seven, had fallen in love with a corgi she had played with in Hyde Park. It belonged to the family of Viscount Weymouth, a future Marquess of BathPrincess Elizabeth, then only seven, had fallen in love with a corgi she had played with in Hyde Park. It belonged to the family of Viscount Weymouth, a future Marquess of Bath.The breed was little known outside South Wales, but the young princess and her sister Margaret pleaded with their parents for one of their own.The Duke and Duchess of York needed little persuading and Mrs Thelma Gray, breeder of the Weymouths\u0027 dog and a pioneer of the breed, supplied the first royal corgi, Rozavel Golden Eagle — or Dookie, so-called by Mrs Gray because, she claimed, he acted \u0027aristocratically\u0027.Three years later Dookie acquired a wife called Jane but this royal marriage of convenience proved unproductive.Jane did produce two puppies with another mate, however, and Crackers and Carol joined King George and Queen Elizabeth\u0027s household during World War II.In 1944, Susan arrived as Princess Elizabeth\u0027s birthday present. Mistress and pet were inseparable. She even accompanied the Princess on her honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947, hidden from view under a blanket in the royal carriage.The following year, when the Princess gave birth to her first baby, Charles, newspaper columns were full of advice on how she could prevent Susan from becoming jealous of the infant prince.A year later, Susan followed her royal mistress into motherhood, producing a pair of puppies: Sugar, who belonged to Prince Charles, and Honey who, in later years, lived with the Queen Mother. It marked the beginning of a new royal dynasty.Over the years, the Queen became one of the most experienced breeders of Pembrokeshire corgis in the country. She always chose the sire herself, aiming for good-looking puppies that maintain the red colouring of the original Pembrokes.At one stage there were said to be 13 corgis — memorably described by Princess Diana as a \u0027moving carpet\u0027 — lolling in the Queen\u0027s private sitting room, and nipping the heels of footmen, prime ministers, ladies-in-waiting and diplomats.Every few years, a fresh litter arrived and older dogs passed away. No puppies were ever sold instead the Queen ensured that they went to good homes. Susan\u0027s descendants have gone to Australia and America.Then came the dorgis, a cross-breed resulting from an unplanned liaison between one of the Queen\u0027s corgis and Princess Margaret\u0027s dachshund Pipkin.In 2009, it emerged that the Queen had stopped breeding the dogs. It was perhaps the first public sign that our monarch was growing old.She worried about puppies and lively young dogs around her feet, and the fear that she might trip over, hurting herself or them. But what was not clear then was that she no longer wanted any new four-legged companions to replace those that died.Then, three years ago Monty Roberts, the Californian cowboy who inspired the Hollywood film The Horse Whisperer, disclosed what many had suspected: the Queen, who will be 92 on Saturday, did not wish to leave any of her beloved pets after her death. Corgis have an average life of 12 to 13 years, though some can reach 18. Willow was just a few weeks short of her 15th birthday.Inevitably, perhaps, it took a plain-speaking American to give this first intimation of the Queen\u0027s sense of her own mortality.Roberts — after whom the Queen named Monty, one of the corgis that appeared in the James Bond spoof she made with actor Daniel Craig for the London Olympics — was an informal adviser to her on horses and dogs for more than 25 years.He said that when Monty died in 2012, he offered to find the Queen a replacement puppy. \u0027But she didn\u0027t want to have any more young dogs. She didn\u0027t want to leave any young dog behind. I understood we would discuss it further at a later date.\u0027Well, we never did, and I have no right to try to force her into continuing to bring on young puppies if she doesn\u0027t want to.\u0027          Often the dogs are taken to the Queen\u0027s private sitting room when she is having breakfast, and clamour for scraps, slices of toast and marmalade, fed to them from the tableFor now, life for Candy, Vulcan and Whisper will continue as usual. Each day starts with a brisk walk with a footman in the Buckingham Palace gardens and, because of their age, they are relatively easy to handle. The days when former royal butler Paul Burrell, then a Palace page, was knocked unconscious when nine leashed corgis pulled him over on the steps of Sandringham House are long past.When their mistress is at the Palace, the dogs sleep in raised wicker baskets in a boot room near the royal apartments, through which they are at liberty to wander.Often the dogs are taken to the Queen\u0027s private sitting room when she is having breakfast, and clamour for scraps, slices of toast and marmalade, fed to them from the table.Whenever possible, the Queen feeds the corgis herself — their menu includes steak, poached chicken, liver and rabbit.According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, who spent 11 years in the Palace kitchen, the corgis had a \u0027wonderful diet. One day it might be chuck steak, boiled and diced and served with finely chopped boiled cabbage and white rice. The next they\u0027d have poached chicken or liver. Or rabbits shot by William and Harry which we\u0027d clean and cook\u0027.Kate and Wills WON\u0027T know if they are having a boy or a girl...South Korean kills and COOKS his neighbour\u0027s dog then...Kate Middleton and Prince William launch Royal Baby webpage In over his head!

Prince Philip has referred to this as her \u0027dog mechanism\u0027 therapy.And she is very hands-on with their personal maintenance, de-fleaing them and administering medicine. Nothing is too much trouble. When she is being fitted for a new dress, the Queen produces a special magnet to pick up pins to ensure the dogs do not prick their paws.No world figure has been as identified with an animal as the Queen has with her corgis.Over the years they have brought a warmth to her public image, being photographed at her side receiving statesmen in formal situations, or on a tartan picnic rug with the Royal Family at Balmoral, or being bundled by a flunky up the steps on to a royal plane.In a life governed by protocol, they are also a simple way to break the ice with strangers. The line may now have ended, but Willow, like each and every one of her corgis, will be remembered.Reacting to news of Willow\u0027s death yesterday one royal fan, Angela Cox, recalled visiting Sandringham just after the Queen had been there.In a tweet she said: \u0027There was a small posy on each of her dogs\u0027 graves.

She might have been a relative. ‘It wasn’t until I saw the news that I realised Dale had died. It’s a shame as he seemed a nice man. I recognised him from the television\u0027. Dale started his career in local radio and had little work for eight years until he spent nearly a decade hosting Supermarket Sweep before fronting the National Lottery show In It To Win It on BBC1 for 14 years and the Pick of the Pops show on BBC Radio 2 for ten years.But the star, known for his sunny disposition, bright smile and tan, disappeared from public life two years ago admitting he ‘wouldn’t leave the house’ because of depression and regrets that he had failed to admit he was gay until he was 45.A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders. But this year he relaunched his career with a US travel show on Channel 5 called Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive.  Last night Winton\u0027s agent confirmed his death at home at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious. He adored being in show business \u0026amp loved meeting fans. He devoted his life to making everyone else happy, his friends, the public \u0026amp his godsons, even though he found it hard to be happy himself. I pray he has found peace\u0027. In June 2016, two months before he was last seen in public, he said: \u0027I would not leave the house for five years. I didn’t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, “I want to withdraw.\u0027A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027Comedian David Walliams also said he was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to hear of the death of his friend, who spoke openly about his battle with depression two years ago.But describing how much fun he was to be around he said: \u0027One night Dale \u0026amp I were going out to dinner \u0026amp he stopped off on the way to buy diet lemonade from a corner shop. He was in there about 20 minutes. When he finally got back in the car I asked ‘what took you so long?’ \u0026amp he said ‘sorry David I am very big with the Indian community!’In another anecdote he said: \u0027One afternoon Dale \u0026amp I were out shopping \u0026amp some policeman were standing on the street corner. He gave them a huge wave \u0026amp called out ‘hello loves, hello darlings!’ I asked why he was saying hello. He replied ‘always wave at policemen David. You never know when you might need one!’ Winton was a household name in the mid 1990s and early 2000s while fronting shows like Supermarket Sweep and The National Lottery: In It To Win It, but had kept a low profile in recent years.   He was born in Marylebone,London, in May 1955 to Gary and Sheree, an actress.Writing in his autobiography, Dale Winton: My Story, in 2002, the much loved star touchingly described his relationship with his beloved mother.\u0027In truth though, I always felt my Mum would forgive me anything.

Tree pollens tend to be most active from March to May and weed pollens from early spring to early autumn.Symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes.                                                     DEFRA guidance for high air pollution said: \u0027Adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors.\u0027People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.\u0027Older people should also reduce physical exertion.\u0027Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.\u0027Around 29,000 Britons are killed annually by air pollution - 15 times more than the 2,000 who die in road accidents - Department of Health-backed research shows.With temperatures expected to hit a scorching 80F, the bookies have slashed the odds into just 14 that Thursday notches up the highest temperature of 2018. And the scissors have also been taken to the price that a whopping 86F (30C) is reached (64) anywhere in UK. It\u0027s also now a 65 shot that despite its sodden start, this April takes home the accolade as being the warmest ever. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: \u0027The gorgeous weather has got us feeling flush and we\u0027ve been forced to slash the odds of the sunshine sticking around. \u0027Bosses ought to expect workers to be pulling sickies left, right and center this week as the mercury rises.\u0027 Supermarket chiefs are stockpiling beer, cider and sun cream as the min-heatwave sweeps in.Sainsbury\u0027s predict a 300 per cent rise in demand for sun cream and a 100 per cent increase in sales of fake tan over the next couple of days – so punters can look ready-bronzed in the sunshine.They also estimate 70 per cent more sales of beer and cider, a 30 per cent uplift in Rosé wine and a 150 per cent increase in demand for ice cream.And as the BBQ gets dusted down for the first time this year, the supermarket believes sales of vegan and vegetarian food will soar by 130 per cent.A Sainsbury\u0027s spokesperson said: \u0027It seems the whole country has been eagerly awaiting the warmer weather, and we\u0027re expecting our customers to celebrate the return of sunshine by bronzing with fake tan, cooling down with ice cream and firing up the barbecue.\u0027 The high temperatures will not just be confined to one part of the country, with 68F-70F (20C-21C)  expected in Newcastle, 64F-66F (18C-19C) in Northern Ireland and 63F (17C) in Glasgow.Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: \u0027It\u0027s going to be a pretty nice day - it will be a slow start in places with cloud first thing.\u0027But by mid-afternoon there will be lots of unbroken sunshine.\u0027Thursday could see even higher temperatures - 77-80F  (25C-27C) in the South East - as warm air continues to come up through Spain and on to the UK.Saturday could see isolated showers in parts, while there is \u0027uncertainty\u0027 about what Sunday\u0027s weather will bring.Experts predict these warm conditions are likely to last for the rest of the month, with changeable conditions continuing in the northwest, while the southeast still has some decent dry and bright spells.Toasty temperatures will even be higher than those in Malibu, Athens and Rome. The start of the week should see warm weather in the south and the east, but the north and west have a high risk of rain and wind.The southeast can expect the best conditions in the country with the northwest seeing the bleakest.The African plume differs to the Spanish plume the UK experienced last summer which brought with it temperatures of 77F (25C). A Spanish plume is caused by cool Atlantic air being pushed towards Spain, which in turn pushes warm Spanish air towards the UK, bringing with it hot humid weather.   Get ready for two weeks of sun!

Although Copperfield (left in court yesterday) said it might be his fault if an audience volunteer who was participating in an illusion got hurt, the celebrated magician didn\u0027t acknowledge responsibility for injuries Gavin Cox (right) claims to have suffered when he fell      The illusionist (pictured in court on Wednesday) said he passed through the same outdoor alley alone while performing another illusion about 10 minutes earlier, and didn\u0027t notice any debris  The 61-year-old performer is due to return to the witness stand next Tuesday for more testimony in Clark County District Court Copperfield said he didn\u0027t know whether there as a powdery residue near a trash bin in an MGM Grand alley. He said he passed through the same outdoor alley alone while performing another illusion about 10 minutes earlier, and didn\u0027t notice any debris.\u0027If in fact there was construction dust, could that be your fault if someone fell and got hurt?\u0027 Morelli asked.Copperfield responded that he couldn\u0027t answer a hypothetical question before proceedings ended for the day.Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid giving away performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of the illusionist\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors. The performer is due to return to the witness stand next Tuesday for more testimony in Clark County District Court.          Gavin Cox (pictured) was overcome with emotion as opening statements were made in the case. He claims that on returning to Britain after taking part in the trick, he suffered chronic pain while a scan showed a lesion on his brain.He said Copperfield\u0027s assistants hurried him down a secret passage, through a door and outside into the open air. He said: \u0027It was like a fire alarm went off. They were saying Hurry! Run, run, run!\u0027It was total pandemonium. You don’t know where you are going. It’s dark. There are hands pushing you on your back. As I went around a corner, my feet slipped from underneath me and I hit the ground.\u0027Mr Cox says he fell as he ran around the side of the theater.In the interview, he said that he as now forced to wear an oxygen \u0027lung\u0027 at night because he stops breathing, and he spent three months in a Californian brain trauma centre. The couple claimed they had been forced to live in the US for years as the case dragged on.Mrs Cox said in 2016: \u0027We are too broke to go out and Gavin’s injuries prevent us from enjoying a normal life. Gavin once cooked for royalty but now he can’t even bake a muffin because he has nerve damage in his hands and no sense of smell.\u0027 Mr Cox said he blacked out after his fall but remembers the audience cheering at the end of the trick. An ambulance later took Mr Cox to hospital where his right shoulder was found to be dislocated.Two days later he filled out an accident report at MGM and hired a US personal injury lawyer.  Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid disclosing performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of Copperfield\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors Once back in Britain, Mr Cox said he began to suffer chronic pain, headaches and confusion. A scan would later show lesions on his brain. But Mrs Cox said NHS waiting lists were ‘too long and he needed immediate treatment’.So the couple returned to Vegas in February 2014. Their travel insurer refused to pay for ongoing treatment, but they were seen under a \u0027medical lien\u0027 – doctors agreed to treat Mr Cox and receive payment only when the lawsuit is settled.Mr Cox\u0027s career had once included years as a chef at London’s Buck’s Club, where he cooked for the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and Dracula actor Christopher Lee, and running a guesthouse in Broadstairs, Kent. But he said in the interview that he has been unable to work since the accident.Having had multiple operations on his back and neck, he said he had been diagnosed with permanent brain damage and a form of Parkinson’s. The Coxes were forced to sell their guesthouse for £515,000 at the end of 2014 and had been living off their savings. At the time of the interview, the Mail On Sunday quoted Copperfield’s lawyers as saying they denied all allegations but could not comment further due to ongoing litigation.They added: ‘This illusion has been performed for more than 15 years and with more than 100,000 participants. The history of the show speaks for itself.\u0027                        "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/08/05EA31B9000003E8-0-image-m-11_1524121343754.jpg","title":"Experts deemed John Worboys fit release blast public backlash","story":"    The decision by the Parole Board that John Worboys (pictured) was safe for release sparked a public backlashTwo experts who gave evidence that almost led to the release of black cab rapist John Worboys say the public backlash against them was wrong.The psychologists were slammed by the High Court at a hearing last month for failing to probe if the the serial sex attacker was being \u0027open and honest.\u0027In a letter in The Psychologist journal, the pair, who have not been named, hit out at the public approaching the case in a \u0027common sense fashion.\u0027They claimed that \u0027sometimes common sense let us down\u0027 and hinted Worboys posed less risk because he had repeatedly denied his guilt.In the letter, The Sun reports, they cited a 2015 study of 7,000 sex offenders in the UK, which showed that \u0027those who took full responsibility for their offence sexually re-offended at a significantly higher rate than those who took partial or no responsibility for their offence.\u0027The decision by the Parole Board in January that he was safe to walk free, sparked a huge backlash. Worboys, 60, was convicted of attacks on 12 women at his 2009 trial after \u0027sample\u0027 charges were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. But police believe he assaulted at least 105 between 2002 and 2008. The Parole Board made its decision while taking into account his 19 convictions, and not the 100 or more offences he is suspected of carrying out.

Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick was then forced to quit.   Justice Secretary David Gauke (left) has admitted he is responsible for the Parole Board\u0027s decision, which eventually saw its chairman Nick Hardwick (right) forced to resign when the ruling was overturned The Crown Prosecution Service  is facing mounting pressure to review the decision not to charge Worboys in connection with some of the 83 cases that police passed files to them on.A spokesman for the CPS said that every rape allegation which met the evidential test was prosecuted. No further charges have been brought forward and the CPS said ti would only review the cases should new evidence surface.  Two weeks ago Justice Secretary David Gauke admitted he is responsible for the Parole Board decision.He told the Sun on Sunday that he did not want the serial sex attacker to be released and that he was pleased the High Court challenge by two victims to overturn ruling was successful.He said: \u0027Clearly, things didn’t go as they should have gone. \u0027Look, I made the decision. I accept responsibility, so I’m not hiding behind my advisers. It’s my responsibility entirely.\u0027The Justice Secretary refused to block the parole board decision as outrage mounted and instead waited for victims to launch a legal challenge.He added: \u0027I felt it ­sensible to take advice from a top barrister and I interrogated that advice and concluded it was right I don’t take the action.\u0027I was pleased it was successful and Worboys remains behind bars — I didn’t want Worboys released. My focus now is ensuring we learn the lessons from the case.\u0027Mr Gauke has also faced calls to join parole board chair Professor Nick Hardwick in quitting his position after the U-turn was finalised.    John Worboys experts blast public backlash against them after deeming the rapist fit for release"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/01/4B4BD9FB00000578-0-image-m-59_1524097654750.jpg","title":"Truck carrying mobile home edges way tiny bridge INCH perfect","story":"This is the moment a brave lorry driver edged across a tiny wooden bridge ning a fast-flowing river despite towing a mobile homeIt is not known precisely when or where the footage was filmed. It is also not clear why the driver chose to use this bridge instead of a sturdier one, or where the house was being taken. That\u0027s my jam!

Put down the phone, stop with the selfies.. and LISTEN. **Cover your NOSE \u0026amp MOUTH.**\u0027 Aviation experts say the masks are essential in ensuring passenger safety during aircraft emergencies.The Federal Aviation Administration calls the masks \u0027the first line of defense against the potentially lethal effects of hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning.\u0027 Hypoxia occurs when a person isn\u0027t getting enough oxygen, which can cause dizziness, reduced vision, impaired judgment, unconsciousness and even death. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus say if a plane loses pressure at 40,000 feet, those on board have as little as 18 seconds of \u0027useful consciousness\u0027 without supplemental oxygen.According to flight attendants, at this point the masks should drop from the cabinets overhead and they can then be activated by tugging them towards you.Passengers then need to strap the masks over both their nose and mouth before fastening the white cords behind their heads. In the picture, at least three passengers can be seen pressing the masks to their own faces and only covering their mouths.Mr. Laurie\u0027s post has now been liked and re-tweeted over 20,000 times, as several others voiced their concerns over the passengers\u0027 actions. Jennifer Riordan, 43, a mother of two, was killed on the Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas on Tuesday morning - the first fatal incident in US commercial aviation for nearly a decade. The Boeing 737-700 took off without incident but minutes into the flight, passengers heard an explosion in the left engine, which sent shrapnel flying through the window, shattering the glass and leading oxygen masks to drop.     Terrifying images shot from on board show the carcass of the ruined aircraft engine which malfunctioned mid-airJennifer  was nearly drawn out of the window which was next to her seat and had to be pulled back into her seat by other passengers.After the plane made a rushed emergency landing -

But no longer. For the world’s wealthy, living a 100-year life is not an outcome they consider a mere possibility. It’s one they expect.”Numerous studies have provided evidence that wealth inequality is linked to health inequality. Last year, data compiled by the Department of Health showed that in the UK the gap between rich and poor in relation to “healthy life expectancy” – defined as a life free of disease or disability – had widened to almost 20 years. A University of Washington study in the US in 2017 came to a similar conclusion on a “life expectancy gap” between affluent and poorer areas of at least 20 years. However, even the wealthy worry about having enough money to pay for healthcare when they are older, according to UBS. There is more appetite to work longer and to spend less today to save for tomorrow, amid concerns about how to pay for end of life care.Nine in 10 say their health is more important than increasing their wealth and a similar number believe their wealth enables them to live a healthier life. Those with more than $10m spend four times more on health than their less wealthy peers. Ultra-high net-worth iniduals with $50m-plus claim they would part with nearly half their riches in exchange for an extra 10 years of healthy life. UAE investors are the most likely to sacrifice more while US investors are the least likely.The longer they live, the quicker the wealthy are going to give away their riches and the more likely they are to skip a generation and give wealth to their grandchildren rather than their children.Nearly two in three plan to give away more of their wealth while they are still alive to see heirs enjoy it, especially in Switzerland but less so in Mexico and the US, where people worry about outliving their assets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8780603e47df3809c0daffcb34dda488f1f1d777/0_18_3466_2080/master/3466.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b7b9a048bf51066bfe60ba448730f30b 1240w","title":"oil price rally commodities rally uk retail sales debenhams business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, as Brent crude hits its highest level since November 2014America’s jobs market continues to sizzle.The number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell to 232,000 last week, from 233,000.

As previously stated, Takeda intends to maintain its well-established idend policy and investment grade credit rating.Takeda also argues that merger with Irish-headquartered Shire would make sense:Building on Takeda’s existing momentum, the acquisition of Shire would accelerate its transformation and result in a global, value-based, R\u0026ampD-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan, with a balanced geographic footprint, a robust, modality-erse pipeline and enhanced financial strength.Reuters is reporting that Japanese firm Takeda Pharmaceuticals has made an ‘indicative takeover proposal’ for Shire - which produces the ADHD drug Adderall - worth £43bn, or £46.50 per share.Last month, Takeda said it was considering making an offer for Shire, so the City has been waiting for the next move. Under takeover rules, Takeda has until 25 April to bid, or walk away.Shire was founded in Hampshire, but is now based in Ireland for tax purposes. Takeda is particularly interested in its rare diseases portfolio, where it has 40 programmes in its drug pipeline.Shire are currently up 256p at £40.12, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.Russia has launched an attempt to win compensation over America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium.That’s an important distinction - as major exporters can ask for compensation under WTO rules if they are penalised by such safeguards.Although the United States presented the measures at issue as being adopted to address the threat that imports of steel and aluminium pose to the US national security, they are in essence safeguard measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards and Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) are applicable to them.The United States did not provide notification under paragraph 1(c) of Article 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards on taking a decision to apply the safeguard measures to the WTO Committee on Safeguards.The Russian Federation is a WTO Member that has a substantial interest as exporter of the products subject to the safeguard measures. Therefore, the Russian Federation requests consultations with the United States under paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards and paragraph 2 of Article XIX of the GATT 1994.So, Russia now joins China, India and the EU in opposing these tariffs: “With snow and rain right through March including in the critical run up to Easter, it’s no surprise that shoppers avoided the high street. So, while online retailers benefited to some extent, last month’s retail sales were particularly disappointing.“Footfall was significantly impacted by the weather, and the first of retailers’ springsummer fashion and home product ranges would have been of little consolation to shoppers looking to stay warm.“But, it’s not all doom and gloom.

Moreover, our most recent survey* shows that consumer sentiment is recovering and is higher than it was both in December and this time last year. This is particularly true of younger people, with more under 45s saying they think they’ll be better off next year.Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, also blames the icy blast of grim weather for keeping shoppers off the streets.“While Mother’s Day and an early Easter provided some respite for retailers in March, the impact of two Beasts from the East was brutal.“The high street felt the worst of the chill as shoppers simply stayed at home to avoid the snow.

And pretty clearly the U.S. has Russia in its sights for a number of reasons known to them,” said UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw.“A logical extension would be if you were to broaden sanctions, then Norilsk would fall under that remit.” Russia’s Norilsk Nickel, or Nornickel, is the world’s second-biggest nickel producer.An official for Nornickel this week dismissed the idea of the prospect of sanctions on the company driving up the nickel price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9cdc9bb8950bfa366bf4f7bf2637e74a4006972/0_0_3950_2370/master/3950.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af0ed96704e9ef195e6d382d98b90faa 2600w","title":"basel in the spotlight the city that learned to love lsd albert hofmann","story":"‘Bicycle Day’ on 19 April is the 75th anniversary of the day Albert Hofmann accidentally discovered LSD, changing his perceptions – and the city’s futureSeventy-five years ago, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann experienced the world’s first full-blown LSD trip on his way home from his lab in Basel. Hofmann had been researching the ergot fungus, hoping to develop a drug to treat fatigue. Among the compounds he was analysing was lysergic acid – Lysergsäure-Diethylamid in German, also known as LSD. On Friday 16 April 1943, Hofmann left the lab feeling a little dizzy: “I lay down and had these wonderful dreams – I saw every thought as an image,” he said in an interview for his 100th birthday. The chemist concluded that he had accidentally touched the substance, and was intrigued by its powerful effect.Three days later, on 19 April, he returned to the lab and swallowed a tiny amount just to see what would happen: “As it later turned out, it was five times too much and gave me a horror trip.” He asked an assistant to take him home by bicycle, and Basel transformed into a panorama of hellish and heavenly visions. The bike seemed to freeze to the spot a friendly neighbour turned into an evil witch. Hours later, Hofmann felt wonderful. “LSD called me, I didn’t seek it out,” he recalled. “It came to me.”Today, Basel wears its psychedelic history with pride. Locals point out that the city has for centuries served as a safe haven for rebels and free thinkers. An exhibition at Basel’s Kunstmuseum celebrates Hofmann’s discovery in the context of the city’s creative history, pairing it with nightmarish, horror trip-like prints by Old Masters such as Bruegel. Thousands of visitors are expected to flock to Basel to celebrate “Bicycle Day”, as 19 April is known among the cognoscenti. And researchers are studying LSD’s medical properties again, shrugging off decades of stigma. Switzerland’s relatively permissive regulations around researching LSD have helped the renewed effort to understand its medical potential. New methods, including advanced brain scanners, also give unprecedented insights into its effects. One study by the Swiss psychiatrist Peter Gasser has recently shown that LSD can be used to reduce a sense of existential fear. Its capacity to induce feelings of deep bliss raise the prospect of therapeutic uses, for example to treat depression. “LSD is a Baseler product,” said Matthias Liechti, a clinical pharmacologist at University Hospital Basel, who leads a research project on the effects of LSD on the human mind and body. “It’s tied to Basel’s history as a centre of pharmacology and innovation.”  250 micrograms – the amount of LSD Hofmann ingested before his bike trip 200 micrograms – the amount of LSD participants take in the study at University Hospital Basel 40 – number of museums in Basel, which has Switzerland’s highest museum density3 - percentage rise in housing costs (including rent and heating) in Basel over the last two years35 – percentage of foreigners living in Basel Basilia was first mentioned in 374 CE, having started as a small Celtic settlement by the Rhine. Its reputation as an innovation hub began in 1460, with the founding of Basel University, Switzerland’s oldest, which in 1661 acquired the world’s first public art collection – setting Basel’s other big theme, fine art. During the Reformation, silk dyers arrived, laying the foundation for Basel’s pharmaceutical and chemicals companies. In 1897, Basel hosted the First Zionist Congress under Theodor Herzl. In 1996, Sandoz – in whose labs Hofmann discovered LSD – and its rival Ciba merged to create the chemicals giant Novartis.Musically speaking, Basel’s most important contribution to pop culture may indeed be LSD. Countless songs have been inspired by Hofmann’s discovery at the Sandoz lab, and it’s hard to think of a chemical compound with a broader and deeper musical influence. “Well I met a girl called Sandoz, and she taught me many, many things ...” sang the Animals. Even in current LSD studies, psychedelic music is played to the participants. On the other hand, John Lennon tried hard to dispel the rumour that the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds was a nod to the substance and its acronym.Art Basel is one of the world’s most famous and extravagant art fairs, with off-shoots in Hong Kong and Miami Beach. But locals say there’s much more to Basel’s art scene than record prices. The city’s free-thinking legacy has inspired a robust counter-cultural tradition – with or without the help of mind-altering substances. Sebastien Pierre Portron, an art consultant, grew up here and returned to the city three years ago after some time abroad. “People from all over Europe have been coming here for centuries,” he said. “Not just artists but different people from all cultures, all religions. In the arts, people came to Basel from very early on. Holbein the Elder and the Younger came here to develop and promote their art, and many others followed – Picasso, and more recently, even Ai Wei Wei.”Portron works for Artstübli, a gallery set up by a local curator, Philipp Brogli, that promotes urban art. The gallery works with newcomers as well as more established urban artists. Among them is the French artist Invader, famous for his “space invader” mosaics in public spaces – of which there are 24 in Basel alone.Gen Atem, a Swiss urban artist based in New York and Zurich, remembers being one of the first contributors to Basel’s budding graffiti scene in the 1980s. “I used to take the train from Zurich to Paris or Amsterdam, because at the time, a lot of good sprayers were there,” he said. “My train passed Basel, and I looked out of the window and noticed that all the walls there were still empty. And that’s how it started.”He says now the urban art scene in Basel has overtaken that of Zurich, its longtime rival. Basel’s location helps – it sits between Switzerland, Germany and France, attracting artists from all over. And Art Basel is pulling in more and more graffiti artists as the boundary between commercial and street art increasingly dissolves. The seriously committed will have already bought their tickets to the special anniversary congress in Basel that features some of the world’s leading LSD researchers – the event is sold out. Basel Art Center offers a special LSD night as part of its psychedelic retrospective of HR Giger, the Swiss artist known for his terrifying designs for Alien, the movie. Basel Short Stories, an exhibition at the Kunstmuseum, honours Hofmann as well as other Basel luminaries such as Erasmus and the feminist Iris von Roten. And, more prosaically, there are the many cycling routes in and around the city.Gentrification. “In Switzerland’s cities, entire neighbourhoods are changing: first they are cheap and attractive, then the new residents bring in more money, and in the end the existing population can hardly afford the rising rents,” wrote journalist Benjamin von Wyl. He sees Basel as a particularly striking example: the supply of available flats has shrunk by two-thirds since 2005.Amid local protests over the rising cost of living, Novartis and BASF are now planning to turn a 300,000 sq m industrial site in the Klybeck area into a whole new neighbourhood. According to Von Wyl, a spokesperson for the Baseler canton said the new community would not become an “urban monoculture for the better off” – without revealing concrete steps for preventing this from happening. Local papers Basler Zeitung and bz Basel, and Zurich’s Neue Zürcher Zeitung have run several in-depth features and interviews on the anniversary. In LSD, My Problem Child, Hofmann writes about his life, his discovery of LSD and his research into sacred plants. He warns against “mistaking this substance for a pleasure drug”. But with the right spiritual preparation and under the right medical conditions, he argues, his “problem child could become a wonder child.”Do you live in Basel?

But as the country’s 70th anniversary nears, the strain is showingBen-Gurion Boulevard climbs from the bustling port on Haifa’s Mediterranean shore up Mount Carmel towards the famous Bahai shrine, its gleaming golden dome surrounded by lush terraced gardens. On the south side of the palm-lined road, on a spring lunchtime, the Fattoush restaurant is packed with customers chatting noisily in Arabic and Hebrew over Levantine and fusion salads, cardamom-flavoured coffee and exquisite Palestinian knafeh desserts. “I prefer to talk of shared existence rather than coexistence,” says Yona Yahav, the veteran Jewish mayor. “Haifa’s Jews and Arabs are the same Jews and Arabs as in Jerusalem, but here things work in a stable way.” Yahav’s office is lined with portraits of his predecessors, the first two wearing Ottoman tarbooshes. The street outside bears the name of one of them, Hassan Bey Shukri. Yahav flourishes a copy of a Hebrew newspaper notice mourning Shukri’s death in 1940. “I can promise you that this won’t happen if I die,” he jokes. He is also keen to point out that his secretary, Reem, is an Arab. “I can’t tell you that all Jews love Arabs and vice versa, but people do feel safe here.” No one questions that the city is special. “If all of Israel and Palestine could be like Haifa, I’d be happy,” muses Amjad Iraqi, a twentysomething Palestinian intellectual. “It’s not lovey-dovey. Life is essentially segregated but every community accepts that you can do your own thing. It’s not perfect, but it’s still better than everywhere else.” Asaf Ron, who runs the municipally funded Beit Ha’Gefen cultural centre, argues that it is all about promoting empathy. “Many Israeli Jews don’t know any Arabs. We need to break down stereotyping and fear.”Ayman Odeh, Israel’s most prominent Arab politician, lives in the Kababir neighbourhood, with its handsome mosque and stunning views over an azure sea. He also believes his home town is different. He served on the city council before being elected to the Knesset in 2015. “The situation between Jews and Arabs has always been better in Haifa than anywhere else in Israel, but it is far from equal,” he insists. “The mood is good and there is a sense of sanity. But it is not an island.” The local HQ of Odeh’s party, the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality, is on Ben-Gurion Boulevard opposite Fattoush. It is ironic that the street is named after David Ben-Gurion, the Jewish state’s founder and first prime minister. But there are many similar examples: the Istiqlal (“Independence”) mosque is at the junction of Shavei Zion (“Returnees to Zion”) and Kibbutz Galuyot (“the Ingathering of the Exiles”) streets. Zionism Avenue snakes across the Carmel to the downtown Arab quarter of Wadi Nisnas. Identity issues will be in the air in Haifa this month and next when Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its independence and Palestinians mourn the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, that the 1948 war represented for them. “Arabs don’t take part in Independence Day celebrations,” says Yahav. “They don’t feel it is their holiday.” Johnny Mansour, a historian from the Greek Catholic community, will be joining a “march of return” to some of the hundreds of Arab villages destroyed after the war – the same symbolic commemoration that has triggered the recent deadly upsurge of violence on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Fattoush, proudly flaunting its Palestinian nationalist credentials, will be closed to mark the occasion.Haifa once represented modernity and progress but feels less dynamic these days. In the twilight years of the Ottoman empire it was the terminus for a branch line of the Damascus-Hejaz railway. Allenby Street is named for the British general who freed the town in 1918, soon after the Balfour declaration backed the establishment of a “Jewish national home” in Palestine. The port opened in 1933, followed by an oil pipeline starting in Iraq. At that time, explains historian Motti Golani, half the Jewish population spoke Arabic. During the second world war, when Italian aircraft bombed the city, Jews and Arabs huddled together in basements. By 1948, the population was 70,000 Jews and 65,000 Arabs. But war changed that. In April, as fighting raged and the British prepared to leave, all but 3,000 Arabs were expelled or fled to Lebanon or the West Bank. The history of that fateful year remains bitterly contested: the Jewish mayor – unaware of military planning – urged Arab leaders to stay but they felt unable to comply with the terms for a truce. Newly arrived Jewish immigrants moved into abandoned homes in Wadi Salib. Many houses, defined as “absentee property”, are now in a state of advanced decline. The city’s flea market is held in the shadow of a crumbling Turkish bathhouse, Hammam al-Pasha. Impressive new glass and steel towers, housing the city’s courts, loom over the ruins. Haifa occupies an important place in Palestinian collective memory thanks to local luminaries such as Emile Habibi and Toufik Toubi. Habibi wrote the best-known novel by a Palestinian in Israel: The Secret Life of Saeed: The Pessoptimist. Etched on his grave are the words: “I remain in Haifa.” Acre-born Ghassan Kanafani, assassinated by the Mossad, captured the essence of the conflict in his novella Return to Haifa, in which a visiting Palestinian refugee encounters an Israeli woman who survived Auschwitz. Palmer Gate, the entrance to the port, is where Holocaust survivors came ashore and terrified Palestinians fled by boat to Acre or Beirut, mostly never to return. Haifa’s tolerance is tested at regular intervals. In October 2000, at the start of the second intifada, 13 Arab citizens were shot dead by police while demonstrating in solidarity with their kinfolk in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Yahav’s predecessor ensured the city remained calm. It was harder three years later when a woman suicide bomber from Jenin blew herself up and killed 21 others in Maxim’s restaurant – jointly owned by Jews and Arabs. In the Lebanon war of 2006, a missile fired by Hezbollah killed two elderly Arabs. Successive Israeli wars against Hamas in Gaza – in 2008-9, 2012 and again in 2014 – saw anger flare. “In Haifa, Arabs and Jews live alongside each other, but when there is tension they move apart,” argues Amjad Shbita of Sikkuy, the Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality. “Haifa’s coexistence is the best in Israel, but it can still be easily damaged.” Palestinians in Haifa and across Israel have grown closer to relatives and friends beyond the pre-1967 “green line” border with the West Bank, but their lives are very different and they have their own issues close to home. In 2013, protests erupted over a government plan to demolish the homes of“unrecognised” Bedouin communities in the Negev and build a Jewish town. Two years ago, after an unusually hot autumn, fires consumed large areas of the Carmel, triggering accusations by rightwing Jewish politicians of an “arson intifada” – though no one was ever charged. Haifa-based NGOs have their work cut out tackling discrimination in social services and budget allocations. The worst poverty is in Halissa, a mainly Arab neighbourhood where violence is blamed on rivalry between Bedouin clans and relocated collaborators from the West Bank. “The Israeli idea of coexistence is about a majority and a minority – the strong and the weak,” observes Tom Mehager of Adalah (Justice), which is devoted to securing the rights of Israel’s Arab citizens – and has vocally condemned the army’s killing of Palestinians in Gaza. “Coexistence is not equality. Speaking the same language and eating hummus together doesn’t mean Jews and Arabs are equal.” Jafar Farah, who runs the Mossawa (Equality) centre, compares the relationship between the two peoples to one between “a rider and a horse”. And that, he insists, “is how Yona Yahav deals with the Arab community in Haifa.”Education provides important insights. In Haifa, as elsewhere, Jewish and Arab children mostly attend separate schools. Many Arab children (the majority are Christians), study in fee-paying church schools, and a few dozen in Jewish ones. There are no Jews in Arab public schools, where standards are poor. The curricula are different too. “People want to stay within their own communities to speak in their native languages, have days off on their own holidays, and learn about their own history, culture and religion,” says Asaf Ron. “Assimilation through attending the other community’s schools is a free choice that almost no one chooses.” The Yad beyad (“Hand in Hand”) private network of bilingual schools complains about long waiting lists and a struggle to secure municipal support. In its kindergarten in Hadar, Arab and Jewish six-year-olds sing songs and are captivated by nursery rhymes that interchange Hebrew and Arabic – a heartwarming but highly unusual sight. “The whole country is based on separation in a very profound way,” says Merav Ben-Nun, its community organiser. Older Palestinians tend to be relaxed about this, but younger activists can be contemptuous about condescension or racism towards “colourful” natives. Many are keen to assert their growing self-confidence in the face of what they condemn as Israeli “apartheid and settler colonialism” – in the words of a strategy paper that was drawn up in the cafe Fattoush last December. The closure of Haifa’s Arab theatre, al-Midan (“The Square”), is cited as an example: state funding was withdrawn after it staged a play about a Palestinian security prisoner. The defiant response was to create an autonomous crowdfunded alternative – al-Khashabi (“The Stage”). Its Arabic-language performances are translated into English, but conspicuously not into Hebrew. “Independent Palestinian institutions do not believe in coexistence,” explains Al-Khashabi’s director, Bashar Murkus. “We believe in dialogue from a position of strength and independence.” His colleague Khoulood Tannous flatly refuses even to use the “c” word. “No one is shelling us here,” she adds. “It’s no Gaza, nor the West Bank. It’s mind games.” Politician Ayman Odeh’s disapproving view is that influence should matter more than identity to Israel’s Palestinian minority, in Haifa and beyond, and that joint struggle is the key to a more equal future. “Arabs are developing autonomy at the expense of Arab-Jewish cooperation,” warns Sikkuy’s Shbita. Neither side harbours illusions about the other. “In Haifa it’s not hate, but there’s not too much love either,” is the stark conclusion of Omer Shaffer, a Jewish Technion postgraduate who was both moved and surprised when an Arab colleague told him to “take care” when he went off to do a stint of reserve army duty at a checkpoint in the West Bank. “It’s pretty indifferent. We’ve found a way to ignore each other without killing each other.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd38f0a117aae7aa645b89b77a1fda91b3a8f4db/0_120_3216_1930/master/3216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ca076eca5849326a6f057b13dfebbe5 1240w","title":"aid fragile states david cameron","story":"In fragile states, resolving disputes and building institutions should take priority over a rush to hold electionsBut with nearly 900 million people still living on less than $2 a day, the battle against global poverty isn’t over. And, while growth in countries such as China and India is lifting millions out of poverty, in too many of the world’s poorest countries, progress is completely stuck.A great many of these countries – such as South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan – are what are called “fragile states”. Blighted by conflict and riven with corruption, their governments lack the capacity to deliver the most basic things: jobs, public services and security. Lacking in legitimacy, trying – and frequently failing – to serve deeply ided societies, their institutions struggle to win public support and respect.And their problems radiate around the world. After all, “state fragility” is often what causes migrants to risk everything to seek a better life. Terror training camps thrive in broken or lawless countries.What’s more, the problem is becoming more serious. Estimates suggest that by 2030, half of the world’s poor will live in fragile states. We need to be frank: the global goal to eradicate extreme poverty within the next 12 years will never be met unless this problem is addressed.That is why I put issues like sharing tax information and transparency about ownership at the top of the global agenda. The inability to collect taxes or to stop natural resources being stolen and hidden in rich countries – these are the things that stop people escaping the poverty trap. As I’ve put it before: geography is not destiny, governance is.For the past year I have been chairing the first ever Commission on State Fragility, Growth and Development, a joint venture between Oxford University and the London School of Economics. We have probed issues that many policymakers have previously avoided. And today, the commission publishes its findings.They make for challenging reading. The sad fact is that some of these countries have had decades of aid yet remain as poor as they ever were – some poorer. We have to accept we have often ended up throwing good money after bad. But that is not a reason to stop aid it is a reason to change the way we do aid.The report calls for a new type of realism in the approach towards fragile states. For too long, expectations have been set too high. Instead, simple steps that bring jobs and security matter more than, for instance, setting new national targets for tackling inequality and climate change.It states that the countries concerned must be able to set their own priorities. Again, we have erred in the past. In an effort to help poor countries, donor governments and agencies have imposed priorities on them. However, the aim of international assistance should be to help fragile states to build legitimate and capable institutions, rather than endlessly undermine them with long lists of unachievable goals imposed from outside.Perhaps the most controversial finding is on our approach towards elections. It concludes that the building blocks of democracy – the rule of law, checks and balances, the protection of minorities – matter more than the actual act of holding an election, important though that seminal moment of democracy can be.Even more significantly, the report argues that the rush to multi-party elections is often a mistake far better to take time in resolving disputes and conflicts, forging a genuine national consensus on power sharing, and putting in place checks and balances that may help to prevent another slide towards violence and state failure.Despite the obvious challenges of helping fragile states, I am confident for the future. The world is richer than ever. We have transformational technology at our fingertips that can help cut out corruption and deliver aid more effectively. We’ve seen examples where reconciliation and peace processes have genuinely worked. Look at Singapore, Rwanda, Colombia – they show that countries can escape the fragility trap. I am determined that, with the right approach, many more will too.• David Cameron is a former prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74fb414b85f91523bcf7755c30724c92b1f6855a/0_0_4823_2894/master/4823.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fbb547e584394284a98a8f5326baa54f 1240w","title":"emmanuel macron moderate owen jones","story":"The French president is hailed as a centrist saviour, a bulwark against extremes – even as he cuts taxes for the wealthy, attacks workers’ rights and demonises refugeesThe world has gone mad, the fanatics of left and right are on the march, the voices of reason have been sidelined. This is the view of the self-styled “moderates” or “centrists” of the political world and the commentariat. There has been little reflection about how the broken economic model they defended unleashed so much anger\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspdisillusionment.Rather than debating ideas and policies, they longingly gaze after allegedly charismatic men who might act as saviours. David Miliband is the eternal prince over the water. But their international icon, France’s Emmanuel Macron, provides an instructive lesson in what “centrist” politics means in practice.For the less affluent, it’s a different story. This former investment banker has slashed housing benefit, and hiked taxes on pensioners – in a country where the average monthly pension is just €1,300 (£1,100). His policies have shifted the workplace balance of power from workers to bosses. French students are staging occupations and protests against more selective entry requirements for universities, derided as an attack on free universal education and France’s social model.Another pillar of his agenda is privatisation, including of France’s airports and part of the national energy utility. His confrontation with rail workers is seen as an attempt to lay the foundations for a catastrophic British-style privatisation of the railway industry. EU-mandated deregulation will mean foreign companies can soon compete with the state rail company SNCF, and Macron is transforming it from a state enterprise into a limited company exactly what happened with the formerly state-owned France Télécom.So-called centrists are supposed to be socially liberal. Macron exposes this pernicious myth for what it is. A man who courted left-leaning voters by promising a humane policy towards migrants and refugees now has them firmly in his sights. The number of days a person without papers can be imprisoned in a detention centre is to be doubled the consideration time period for asylum has been halved, meaning fewer refugees will be accepted. Charities warn that refugees fleeing war will be deported. Macron’s interior minister, Gérard Collomb, claims that communities are “breaking up because they are overwhelmed by the inflow of asylum seekers”. No wonder the far-right Front National has described his policies as a “political victory”.Macron offers no future for France, let alone any other western society. There is hope, however. For years after François Hollande betrayed his 2012 election pledge to break with austerity, the French left was in the doldrums. Polls showed that the far right was strongest among the disillusioned, insecure younger generation. The rise of radical left politician Mélenchon changed that: he won nearly a fifth of the vote in the first round of the presidential election, partly by prising some of the disaffected from the jaws of the far right.Macron is presented as an oasis of moderation, a bulwark against the extremes. But there is nothing moderate about slashing taxes on the wealthy, attacking workers’ rights or demonising refugees. He represents a doubling down on an economic model that bred mass insecurity and proved an essential ingredient in the revival of French fascism.It is the same across the west. An unjust economic model long defended by parties of the centre right and centre left – one that brought an economic crash that led to austerity and attacks on living standards – is squarely responsible for the polarisation of politics. If the left fails to provide an inspiring, coherent alternative, it will be the radical right that will triumph."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92ee53ae5b21ec966d50001c1e70470512b0a7ba/0_134_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1adb95d62d46226d655fcabc868abe1a 1240w","title":"oxford cambridge private universities regulator","story":"Over the years, I’ve come to know and almost love the hardy perennial higher education news stories: students so broke they’re turning to sex work, student political correctness gone mad (these days reframed as an avalanche of snowflakes), and the prospect of Oxford and Cambridge going private.In the latest iteration of the latter story, the crossbench peer Lord Butler, a former master of University College, Oxford, argues that the government should view the idea of Oxford and Cambridge going private with sympathy. It comes amid a likely long-term fees freeze and concerns about the powers of the controversial new universities regulator, the Office for Students. After all, why should England’s oldest and most elite universities be subject to what they see as onerous regulation, and a tuition fee cap of £9,250?It matters not that the Office for Students has made clear that interventionist regulation on teaching and research will only kick in where there is evidence of a real risk to students. And on student welfare matters, Toope presumably believes that his institution’s issues with sexual misconduct and mental health problems, and its social apartheid admissions system, are all character-building features that his smart and energetic people should learn from, rather than be protected from through regulation. Framing the regulation of universities in the interests of students as a “threat” is surreal – what do the dons want, the freedom to close a course, or lie about their facilities, or sexually harass students with impunity?Another vice-chancellor who “asked not to be named” said, “We are seeing a real threat to institutional autonomy from ministers,” arguing there is a danger that “Oxford and Cambridge will turn round and say, ‘Sod this, we’ll go private.’” This concept of freedom really matters when Oxbridge or its acolytes threaten to go private. “Academic freedom” – now enshrined in law as the ability to do good things like determine the content of courses or “question and test received wisdom” gets frequently, conveniently and unhelpfully conflated with institutional autonomy – the idea that just because you run a university, you should have total freedom to spend state-subsidised student fees how you wish.And it’s all too easy to forget the vast sums of public funding that the nation has put into these assets in the past.Lord Butler sees a saving opportunity for the government if it were to let Oxford and Cambridge go private – ending their reliance on state-subsidised fees. But not only would the government lose its tidy profit on Oxford and Cambridge graduates’ loan repayments, it’s also hard to see why Oxbridge needs the money from being able to charge higher fees. Vastly inflated fees in the US Ivy League are funding buildings and sports stars, not teaching.So maybe the regular calls for Oxford and Cambridge to go “private” aren’t really about fees or regulation at all. Maybe it’s about a bigger threat – to the age-old Oxbridge tradition of recreating the upper echelons of Britain’s class system. For the hundreds of years they have churned out people who make the law and run the economy, the assumption has been that they should be above the law and those interests we collectively express through the ballot box, rather than subject to it.Now there is a glimpse of a future where the deference and exemptions afforded to those above us might crumble and shift, and perhaps that’s what really worrying the advocates of privatisation.• Jim Dickinson is CEO of the students’ union at the University of East Anglia, editor at changesu.org, and trustee of London Metropolitan University students’ union"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7a6e9e7657f6b5bd0877bca6cddc1da01df39c8/40_0_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e5b00c9a569ab9ada87e0522ee9574f4 1240w","title":"theresa may customs union brexit","story":"Did Brexit seem to slip out of sight, forgotten amid Syrian bombing, plastic-straw banning or the shaming Windrush scandal? It’s back from Easter with a roar, as the Lords on Wednesday delivered a walloping vote supporting the customs union.The 123-vote defeat for the government was far greater than expected, backed as it was by 24 Tory peers, several of whom were former ministers. There are five more days of Lords Brexit debate on the withdrawal bill, including defining a “meaningful vote” on the final deal, so expect more fireworks.The Lords’ fiercest Brexiters warn against – or aim to foment – a constitutional crisis, as Lord Forsyth accused them of “putting peers against the people”. When the Lords’ amendments go back to the Commons, a probable 10 Tory MPs may back them on the customs union – Dominic Grieve is reportedly confident.This is crunch time. As both houses begin to engage in the real battle, this becomes the greatest constitutional risk of our lifetime. Until now, many MPs have tiptoed a fine line between the people’s will and protecting their country’s future. Do MPs take their lead from a one-off referendum or their duty to defend the nation from the clear and present danger of a brutal break with our vital trading partners? The time is short: those many Tory MPs who well know the madness of no deal or a hard deal, yet fear their constituents’ wrath, face that dilemma right now, in public, with nowhere to hide. This is when being an MP gets tough, separating those in craven fear of their electorates from Burkian believers in a higher duty.Keir Starmer this morning sounded confident on the Today programme that enough Tory MPs will vote to stay in the customs union. People didn’t vote on how to leave the EU, he said. Theresa May and David Davis both pledged the UK would keep “the exact same benefits” as it leaves – and that means, at the very least, staying in the customs union. Every week that passes reveals new impossibilities in leaving it, as one industry after another discovers how the nightmarish obstacles of border checks and tariffs will wreck their businesses.As for trade, by now any half-awake MP who is not sticking their fingers in their ears to block inconvenient facts will have understood what leaving the customs union means. As Starmer points out in his calmly reasoned style, leaving the customs union results not just in the loss of EU trade, but also the loss of 37 trade agreements with 67 countries outside Europe. What kind of fantasy imagines our one country alone can replicate, let alone improve on, those deals? Just one example: Lord Bilimoria last night told the Lords he had talked to India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and trade with the UK, minimal now, is a very low priority.By the EU summit in June, the most tendentious issues must be resolved, with none tougher than the question of the Irish border. One Tory commentator recently suggested drones could conduct checks from the air to avoid the pulling down of customs-post cameras by outraged border-dwellers. But the more bizarre the solutions proposed, the more blindingly obvious it has become that the whole of the UK staying in the customs union is the only viable option.Donald Tusk warns there will be no deal, no transition, without an Irish solution. The deal will have to pass the European parliament, whose largest group is led by Manfred Weber, who this week declared: “We are all Irish”, his stout solidarity echoing President Kennedy’s famous “Ich bin ein Berliner” as he stood by the Berlin wall. Our European neighbours have noted the abominable treatment of the Windrush generation, as they decide whether to trust Theresa May’s “hostile environment” Home Office to treat their 3.5 million citizens in the UK well. She and her “nasty party” have truly turned us into a “nasty country” in their eyes.May’s folly in laying out red lines becomes clearer with each retreat she is forced to make. Had she started out on the path to Brexit with a pragmatic openness, she would have saved herself one humiliation after another. Her whips will be out arm-twisting and counting their vote. She would be well advised to get her retreat in first this time, and concede to staying in the customs union before the Commons vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e0b0a3cb6d795eceae26a9bb57395a47730b537/0_185_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=42d9db012729cd1425af4d7dae0ee3ed 1240w","title":"e vehicles electric cars uk sales rise norway china","story":"Stefan Bratzel of the Centre of Automotive Management (CAM), which compiled the data, said: “China and Norway are exceptional in e-mobility.

It is hard work and María’s son, 30 now, has suggested she leave it all behind but it is what she does and what she has always done what she, like many women in Galicia, is. So, there she is each day with her friends, heading across the sand. He, meanwhile, climbs into his old VW Golf, a bit battered now, noisy too, and drives over the Rande bridge across the water to Vigo, where he plays football.“It’s my life,” María told Galician TV. Football is his it is all of theirs. Only one of the Aspas brothers doesn’t play, and an uncle and two cousins play as well, as did their dad, although not at their level. Urbe, like his father, is a goalkeeper while Jonathan is at Pro Piacenza, a midfielder who played for Spain from U15 to U20 level but never made a senior appearance. His younger brother did, although he had to wait until he was 29, and then he scored on his debut – at Wembley. He is a striker for Celta de Vigo and Spain and the question now is not whether or not he travels to Russia this summer, it is whether he starts. And perhaps he should. Because while this has been said before, it’s worth saying again: Iago Aspas is very, very good at football.He always was, even if he couldn’t always show it, just maybe not this good. Some have even dared ask if he might be the best player Celta have had, better than Alexander Mostovoi, Aspas’s idol and the subject of this work of art. Few have been so popular, that’s for sure.Iago was 12 when a 16-year-old Jonathan made his debut for Celta and eight the day he first turned up for trials at the club, which was a problem: they had to be at least nine. So, they lied and never before have a club been happier to be conned. He has left twice – as a kid he was briefly released to a local team called Rapido Bouzas and then there were the disappointing spells at Liverpool and Sevilla – but it is 20 years there now. And if it happened late for a player who didn’t make a first ision debut until he was 25 and had to come go away and come back to fully find himself, it has happened now. He is better than ever.Javier Maté, the man credited with finding him, told El Mundo: “No kid lived football like him he could tell you the goalkeepers of Pakistan.”Above all, though, he knows his club. “At Balaídos, he even knows where the seagulls shit,” Maté said. A Celta fan who once said that he wouldn’t even have a girlfriend who was a Deportivo supporter, he has occasionally lost his head and it has occasionally cost him. At youth level, he was running at a red card every fortnight, some joked. It was an exaggeration but there was something in it. He missed what would have been his first call up to the senior side because he was sent off for the B team. The game he missed was a derby and he was heartbroken. In another meeting with Deportivo, the club’s first for six years, he was sent off, veteran striker Mario Bermejo declaring: “When you go to bed with children, you wake up covered in piss.” Despite that, he became an idol. Or perhaps it was because of that. When he went, they needed him to go when he came back, they welcomed him home. The return was good for him, opportunities afforded that he had not had in Seville or on Merseyside, and the experience away had helped too: there was a lesson there and Moaña was his place, Balaídos too.He matured, although he never entirely left that kid behind: Aspas plays the way fans like to think they would: wild, frantic, desperate to win. He scored twice on his debut as a 21-year-old rescuing them from probable relegation to Spain’s regionalised, four-ision Segunda B, and maybe even from disappearance, and 23 times in the second ision to return them to primera. Since then, he has scored 12, 13, 19, and now 20. No Celta player has got 20 or more for 60 years. Only three others have ever done it.But it wasn’t just that Iago Aspas scored on Tuesday night, clinching a 2-2 draw for Celta against Barcelona and taking him to 20 this season – the top scoring Spaniard for a second year in a row. It was that he did everything else. Apart from take corners.“Tin chest” one former team-mate calls him and there’s something in that: small sure, but chest puffed out, taking on everyone and everything, a touch of the Scrappy Doo about him. A superb player and a yappy one too: pushy, fouly and confrontational as well as talented, quick-witted and clever with the ball. At times it is unpleasant. Worse, much worse, this season Jefferson Lerma accused him of racially abusing him, which Aspas denied (and, with sad inevitability, it pretty much ended there). Paco Herrera his former manager calls him a “street player” Eduardo Berizzo describes him as a player of “jugada propia” – someone who makes his own moves. But he makes everyone else’s too. Tuesday night was another demonstration. “He’s a top player and I’m lucky to be able to enjoy watching him every Sunday,” said the Celta sporting director Felipe Miñambres. “A magisterial lesson,” El Faro de Vigo called it. Watching on TV, Alavés’s Ibai Gómez clapped: “What a player!” Ernesto Valverde described him as “extraordinary”.Michu, who played with Aspas on his debut, tweeted a picture of a magician’s hat, and the words: “One more time.” And that was the point: this was no one off, but a recurring theme. Even if it was Barcelona’s B team – of the starters only Marc Andre Ter Stegen, who rescued them repeatedly, is a regular – and even if it was only a draw, Aspas was right to insist that Celta had deserved to win. This has also happened against the A Team, more than once. It was also the confirmation of a colossal season, the excitement it engenders, the sense that Spain may have a striker who suits their style, the man who came on, scored and provided a assist in their last game.“Barcelona can’t cope with Aspas,” Marca wrote, describing him as “monumental”, a player “capable of carrying an entire team in his arms”.“There are no adjectives to describe him any more,” wrote A La Contra. He was everywhere and everything. He scored a late equaliser – with his hand – and then provided the perfect pass for what should have been the winner. He got a yellow card and got fouled for a red, Sergi Roberto literally grabbing him as he raced away. He ran and passed and shot and by the end of it, he could barely walk. Which is pretty much the way he ends most games, but this was different. “I felt something,” he admitted. Tests showed a tear that will keep him out for two weeks.Celta will miss him as they chase their last, remote chances of a European place. More, perhaps, than any other team would miss any other player.Then there’s what he does to everyone else. “I prefer to talk about the collective but it’s true that Iago is a leader he’s the one that decides,” said the Celta coach Juan Carlos Unzué. “He’s the first to pull on his overalls and get to work, to transmit that attitude, and everyone else follows him.” No wonder only two outfield players (Moreno and Johnny Otto) have played more minutes in Spain this season. Aspas has missed just one game – through suspension, of course.Now, he will miss two more. But Aspas will be back, heading over the bridge from Moaña just in time for the derby with Depor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/887b0905dff13ed60f1237c9021b32f4d3d1a3b8/0_194_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a4e6b1820e8d04ed69ab3f07bb619de0 1240w","title":"jonjo shelvey england midfielder world cup","story":"The Newcastle midfielder has curbed his temper and forced himself into Gareth Southgate’s thinking with a series of impressive displaysJonjo Shelvey began the season by blowing a fuse but could yet end it by switching on the lights for England in Russia this summer.When Newcastle’s playmaker stepped directly into Andre Marriner’s line of vision and trod on Dele Alli’s ankle as Newcastle lost 2-0 at home to Tottenham last August, the referee had no hesitation in reaching for his red card.At that highly self-destructive moment it was almost impossible to see Shelvey as the solution to Gareth Southgate’s creative problems. Moreover, for quite a while afterwards, it seemed that even Rafael Benítez regarded his most gifted midfielder as untrustworthy.Fast forward eight months and Newcastle’s manager happily details not only precisely why Shelvey should join Alli and company on England’s flight to St Petersburg but emphasises the case for Southgate building a World Cup campaign around him.England’s manager, after weeks of discreetly letting it be known that those raking, eye-of-the-needle, 50- and 60-yard, defender-destabilising passes did not compensate for a potentially suspect temperament, appears to be listening.Southgate knows Shelvey spots openings where other players see only blind alleys and possesses the happy knack of unlocking the sort of packed defences his side are likely to encounter at the World Cup.In a world of beige central midfielders specialising in neat, short, tidy sideways manoeuvres, his ability to really hurt opponents provides a welcome splash of shocking pink.Accordingly Southgate is giving serious consideration to including him in his 23-man squad to be named next month. Given that the 26-year-old won the last of six caps in November 2015 and England’s party is set to be announced before the June friendlies against Nigeria and Costa Rica, his inclusion would represent a dramatic late change of heart.Benítez, too, has, albeit almost imperceptibly, shifted his stance on Shelvey in the wake of the former Charlton, Liverpool and Swansea midfielder experiencing an apparent epiphany following that red card against Tottenham.Admittedly a player who has benefited immeasurably from a decision to hire a personal psychologist, was sent off during a home defeat by Everton in December for a second bookable offence but he has collected only four yellow cards all season and none in the past 12 games. “Teams try and provoke me into reacting but I just block it out now,” says Shelvey. “My mindset’s changed.”Although it took time to regain Benítez’s trust and he spent the autumn struggling to oust Mikel Merino from playmaking duties on Tyneside, he has started virtually every game since the new year, his partnership with Mo Diamé playing an integral role in Newcastle’s collection of 22 points from the last possible 36.Along the way there have been plenty of those perfectly calibrated, defence-splitting balls, delivered with both Shelvey’s preferred right and supposedly weaker left foot, as well as several man of the match performances.If his total eclipse of Paul Pogba as Manchester United were beaten 1-0 at St James’ Park proved a particular highlight, the sheer variety of that passing range and his superior vision have served as a reminder that the Londoner’s football intelligence is appreciably higher than sometimes rather snobbish critics care to imagine.After all Shelvey’s unerringly accurate, high-energy assessment of passing angles has helped Newcastle banish their once-acute relegation worries courtesy of four straight victories, the last at Arsenal’s expense last Sunday.“If Jonjo goes to the World Cup, he can be a great player,” says Benítez. “Jonjo’s different from the players England already have and he can do a lot of things. He would be good in Russia. Jonjo’s focused at the moment but I think he’d be even better at a tournament like the World Cup. I think he’d stay really focused. If Jonjo’s part of things for a few weeks he can be a very important player. I think we can forget about his past.”The fairly recent past includes a £100,000 FA fine and five-game ban after he was found guilty of racially abusing the Wolves midfielder Romain Saïss during Newcastle’s ascent to the Championship title last season. Shelvey – accused of calling the Moroccan “a smelly Arab” – continues to vehemently deny the offence.Benítez, privately unimpressed by the Football Association’s handling of the case, offered him staunch support. Indeed in some ways the furore arguably helped bond these ostensibly unlikely soul-mates.Along the way the Spaniard has succeeded in teaching Shelvey to ration those Pirlo-esque passes from his deep holding midfield role, to learn when they might lead to dangerous concessions of possession.Shelvey’s penchant for Hollywood balls can create a sense of tactical anarchy, rather like those of his hero, and former next-door neighbour on Merseyside, Steven Gerrard. This tendency has not always sat well with a manager as wedded to carefully controlled systems as Benítez but, needing each other, the pair have made conscious efforts to ensure their relationship works.“Rafa’s so detailed,’ says Shelvey. “I’ve learnt so much from him. Tactically I’ve got a lot, lot better.”Benítez is justifiably proud of his protege’s improvement. “Jonjo’s technically good,” he says. “When he plays well the team plays better. He can do the difficult things, he’s a very good passer who can deliver the final ball under pressure and set the tempo. Jonjo can control games.”He might also electrify England but that is Southgate’s call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bdb4891aa55cf00f7c113029c4a9bd7bb112609/0_118_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=05d62a5e464a3208a17b7cc9e081ab37 2600w","title":"world cup stunning moments austria wunderteam","story":"In 1934 a revolutionary Austrian side reached the World Cup semi-finals on the back of a storming run. History beckoned. And then turned its backOn the morning of 23 January 1939 Gustav Hartmann burst through the door of a Vienna apartment in search of an old friend. He found him, lying naked alongside his unconscious lover. Matthias Sindelar, Der Papierene, the greatest footballer in Austrian history, shining star of the Wunderteam, the forward fulcrum around whom a ground-breaking new style of play wowed Europe in the early 1930s, was dead. He was 36.The most prosaic explanation is the most likely – carbon monoxide poisoning due to a blocked chimney flue was the cause of death recorded on the police report both for Sindelar and, a few hours later, his partner Camilla Castagnola. But conspiracy theories still abound. The Gestapo had a file on him and had kept his cafe under surveillance. He had celebrated rather too wildly in front of a batch of furious Nazi top brass after scoring against Germany in a game to celebrate the Anschluss (a fixture that was “supposed” to end in a draw) then refused to play for the unified team. Was it murder? A state killing? Suicide? No one will ever truly know for certain, but Castagnola’s neighbours had complained about the chimney problems earlier in the month.Sindelar’s passing serves as a tragic epilogue to the golden days of Austrian football, one that begins with old English gents and Scottish tourists and ends with Nazis, conspiracy, misery and death. In between there came something magical: the Wunderteam, pioneers of the flexible, passing style that inspired Hungary in the 1950s and was taken to its apotheosis by Holland in the 1970s and Spain in the past six years. They were, at their peak, probably the best in the world. But as far as the 1934 World Cup was concerned that peak came just too soon. Even if they weren’t quite at the heights they reached in 1932, they still stormed into the semi-finals on the back of a breathtaking run that had seen them score 101 goals in 31 games over three years. Only Italy, who had been dispatched 4-2 in a Gero Cup match prior to the tournament, stood between them and a place in the final. History beckoned. And then cruelly turned its back.The story of football in Austria goes back to the late 19th century and the European expansion of British trade. As Willy Meisl, whose brother Hugo was the managerial mastermind behind the Wunderteam, points out in his seminal Soccer Revolution, the Austrian public took to the game with gusto and five years after the first match between two Vienna sides in 1894, the first British touring team turned up at the Westbahnhof. It didn’t go particularly well for the hosts – Oxford University beat a combined Vienna XI 15-0 on Easter Sunday 1899. Another game on Easter Monday finished 13-0. A year later the first professional side visited – Southampton again took on a combined team, this time winning only 6-0.But the key visit came in 1905. Rangers hammered teams just as the Saints and the students had done a few years before, but they did it in such style that Austrian football would be moulded in their image over the next three decades (in turn Rangers were so impressed with the young goalkeeper Karl Pekarna that they gave him a contract and took him back to Glasgow). Pass and move became the Austrian groove.In 1926 the 23-year-old Sindelar, darling of the intelligentsia, made his debut for the national side under Hugo Meisl, who had taken control of the team in 1919. The centre-forward was the embodiment of the Austrian style – the triumph of mind over muscle, the pen that was mightier than the sword. The bohemian bourgeoise had taken the game to their hearts in Vienna and in Der Papierene, the Paper Man, they saw a player whose artistry matched their own.And Paper Man is no exaggeration. Footage of Sindelar is limited to a few seconds of scratchy black and white newsreel, but there is no mistaking his startlingly slight, almost gaunt, frame. As builds go he brings no one to mind more than C Montgomery Burns in an era where centre-forwards were supposed to be Rainier Wolfcastles.Sindelar scored on his debut, a 2-1 win over the Czechs in Prague, bagged two more in a 7-1 demolition of Switzerland, and then a fourth in three games against Sweden. But Meisl then hesitated to go on breaking the mould, and turned back to the more traditional centre-forward strengths of Josef Uridil. Sindelar was The Paper Man, Uridil was The Tank.Sindelar was restricted to a bit-part role for the rest of the 20s. He played in the 2-0 win over Switzerland in October 1928, had to wait nearly 18 months for his next taste of action in Prague in a 2-2 draw with Czechoslovakia and then spent a year watching from the stands as the national side stuttered over the course of seven matches, only two of which they won.After that set of indifferent results, Meisl could ignore the clamour for his inclusion no longer and Sindelar was thrown back into the fray when Scotland visited Vienna in May 1931. Der Papierene scored his first international goal since 1926, Scotland were hammered 5-0 and the Wunderteam was born.Over the next two years Sindelar, playing as a kind of 1930s prototype false nine, would score 16 goals in 16 games as the Austrians battered allcomers. Germany were belted 6-0 in Berlin, then taken apart 5-0 in Austria. The Swiss were beaten 8-1 in Basle, the Italians 2-1 in Vienna, the Hungarians 8-2, the Swedes 4-3.“He was truly symbolical of Austrian soccer at its peak period: no brawn but any amount of brain,” writes Willy Meisl of Sindelar. “Technique bordering on virtuosity, precision work and an inexhaustible repertoire of tricks and ideas. He had a boyish delight in soccer exploits, above all in unexpected twists and moves which were quickly understood and shared by his partners brought up on the same wavelength, but were baffling to an opposition only a fraction of a second slower.”In December 1932, with the Wunderteam perhaps at their peak, they became the third overseas side to be invited to England. Previous visitors from the continent had gone home with their tails between their legs – Belgium had been beaten 6-1 in 1923 and 4-0 a year later, while Spain had lost 7-1 at Highbury in 1931. With his team slightly off-colour in the matches leading up to the game at Stamford Bridge Meisl invited his old friend Jimmy Hogan, an Englishman and proponent of the passing style who had long been coaching in central Europe and would later be credited as the inspiration behind Hungary’s victory at Wembley in 1953, back into the coaching set-up having first introduced the Scotsman to Viennese football as far back as 1912.England raced into a 2-0 lead early on and though the visitors dominated after the break they could only pull the score back to 4-3. “It was in that first half-hour that Austria lost her chance of bringing off a sensation compared with which Hungary’s victory at Wembley in 1953 would seem unimportant,” Willy Meisl mourned. For the English the result was seen as a triumph for physicality over finesse and an object lesson in the limitations of the passing game. They would have to wait another 21 years for their wake-up call and the Mighty Magyars.Austria got that setback out of their collective system four days later with a 6-1 win in Belgium and normal service was resumed, the cream of the continent left mesmerised by the revolutionary – in more ways than one – movement of Sindelar and co. Der Papierene was far from alone – Josef Smistik was hugely influential in the centre-half role in Meisl’s 2-3-5. Josef Bican was only 21 at the time of the 1934 World Cup but would go on to be one of the greatest goalscorers of all time. Johann Horvath was a dervish at inside-left, Rudi Hiden one of the great pre-second world war goalkeepers.By the time the tournament rolled around the Wunderteam were indeed past their peak but not by much – their four matches prior to the tournament had been that 4-2 win over Italy in Turin, a 3-2 away win against Switzerland, a 5-2 win over Hungary and a 6-1 win over Bulgaria in a qualifier. They began the tournament – then in a straight knockout format – with an unconvincing 3-2 extra-time win over France.Then came the quarter-final tussle with the old enemy – Hungary. It was a full-blown battle in Bologna but Austria prevailed, with Horvath and Karl Zischek scoring in a 2-1 win.Their own quarter-final with Spain was a slugfest to make the battle in Bologna look tame. Ricardo Zamora, the Spanish goalkeeper, was so battered and bruised that he was unable to play in the replay the following day, a replay that Italy won 1-0 thanks to Giuseppe Meazza’s early goal.That set up a classic clash of styles – Pozzo’s man-marking, bruising, steamroller versus Hugo Meisl’s “Danubian waltz”. The dark arts versus the passing purists. Athletes against aesthetes.Pozzo’s athletes won out. On a San Siro pitch that was a bobbly bog patched with sand and with rain teaming down Italy took an early lead. Peter Platzer, in goal for the injured Rudi Hiden, collected a low cross, felt the full force of Meazza’s challenge and Enrique Guaita poked home what would prove, with Sindelar marked out of the game by Monti, to be the only goal of the game.In the final Czechoslovakia, also proponents of the Meisl passing philosophy, took the lead with 19 minutes left but Raimundo Orsi equalised and Angelo Schiavio scored the winner for Italy in extra time. The triumph was not without controversy – the referee who had allowed Italy’s goal to stand in the semi-final, Ivan Eklind of Sweden, was conveniently enough appointed once more for the final. Spain had complained vehemently about a foul in the buildup to the Italy goal in the quarter-final replay. The shadow of Benito Mussolini lies across the tournament.The Wunderteam’s chance of World Cup glory had gone, they failed to rouse themselves for the third-place play-off, losing to Germany, and though they reached the final of the 1936 Olympic football tournament (where they again lost to Italy), the Anschluss meant there would be no Austrian team at the 1938 World Cup, although several members of the 1934 squad turned out for the German team.Sindelar was not among them. And less than five years after what could, maybe should, have been a crowning glory for Meisl and Austria’s Wunderteam, Der Papierene was dead, leaving behind a legacy of football genius and a sense of mystery that had not dissipated when, six months after the events on the Annagasse in Vienna in January 1939, the Nazi regime ordered the public prosecutor to close the as yet unresolved investigation into Sindelar’s death.“The good Sindelar followed the city, whose child and pride he was, to its death,” wrote the writer Alfred Polgar, who was very much in the conspiracy camp. “He was so inextricably entwined with it that he had to die when it did. All the evidence points to suicide prompted by loyalty to his homeland. For to live and play football in the downtrodden, broken, tormented city meant deceiving Vienna with a repulsive spectre of itself. But how can one play football like that? And live, when a life without football is nothing?”Romanticism aside, Austria’s Wunderteam deserve to be remembered – along with the Total Footballing Dutch, the Hungarians of 1954 and the Brazil teams of 1950 and 1982 – as one of the greatest sides never to lift the World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e41cd337184577de9bf0c346cc2b4b5f56ac1a5/0_556_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f820f2c13c69c6f48ae241ef7724fab0 2600w","title":"scavenging grime sewage gold mumbai streets india","story":"Along the narrow alleys of one of India’s largest bullion markets, men and women scrape a living scouring the dust and even the drains for specks of the precious metal When most of Mumbai is fast asleep at 5am each day, 41-year-old Tanu Behre sets out on her hunt.Armed with a little handbrush, she walks the narrow alleys of Zaveri bazaar, one of India’s largest bullion markets, and dusts the streets for gold. She enters drains outside goldsmiths’ workshops, and gathers the black sludge in her aluminium pan. If she’s lucky, the slime will turn up the precious metal.  Named after the Hindi word for the pans they use, ghamela, there are hundreds of “ghamelawallahs” in Zaveri bazaar – men and women who scavenge grime for gold.Congested, labyrinthine lanes house scores of jewellery workshops and factories, where gold is cut, carved, and shaped. Particles make their way into streets when craftsmen walk out – gold dust gets stuck to their hands, hair or shoes. The particles even get deposited in drains, when goldsmiths wash their hands.“On an average work day, I spend four hours collecting seven to eight pounds of filth and sludge from the streets,” says Wasim Sheikh, 32, a native of the northern Indian city of Agra who migrated to Mumbai a decade ago to pursue his ancestral occupation. As with most other ghamelawallahs, generations of Sheikh’s family have been in the informal trade.After he collects the waste, he submerges it in water. Gold, being heavier, sinks to the bottom, while the mud and dirt float out. He then carries the residue to a secluded corner outside his rented home in Zaveri bazaar, where he lights a tiny furnace to refine the yellow metal. “I add mercury to the residue so that gold particles stick to it, and the trash gets separated. In order to filter out the finer waste – magnetic dust and ferrous particles, I carefully run a tiny magnet over the remains. I then add this residue to a furnace, where I cook it with nitric acid for about 10 to 12 minutes. The acid reacts with mercury to form liquid salts, leaving behind a pellet of gold.”Not every day, however, is lucrative. Mohammed Amir, a 17-year-old, who quit school to join the profession, says the monsoons leave him and his four brothers, also ghamelawallahs, struggling. “All the dirt on the streets gets washed away with rainwater, while the gutters overflow, leaving no scope to identify sewage flecked with gold. Hence, during monsoons, my brothers and I take up other jobs – construction work, hawking at traffic signals or working as domestic labour in homes.”Ghamelawallahs usually collect a gramme or two of gold before selling it to small-time goldsmiths in the bazaar. Mohammed Babloo, 34, says the rates are often lower than market prices. “They tend to haggle with us because they think we’re scavengers, living off sewage from gutters. I normally check rates with at least five buyers before parting with my gold.”But now jewellers, aware of the ghamelawallahs’ work, are increasingly getting cautious about their waste, says Jaymin Zhaveri, a 30-year-old businessman, whose family has been running a jewellery store in the bazaar for 100 years. One shop owner has begun vacuuming and storing the dust. “Workshop owners have started giving uniforms to their craftsmen, which they have to leave behind after work so that gold dust on their clothes is retained with the employers. Others clean the pavements outside their stores themselves, and some even collect the water after goldsmiths wash their hands or shower. All of this waste is preserved over time, and sold to buyers from all over India in bulk,” says Zhaveri. For government street sweepers, meanwhile, the ghamelawallahs are a nuisance. Ranjan Mule, 37, who works with Mumbai’s civic authority, says: “Hundreds of these men and women are out every morning, searching for gold. They collect the dust and sewage, but throw everything else on the streets. There have been instances where ghamelawallahs have stolen garbage off our dumpsters, and littered the waste after.”But ghamelawallahs are undeterred. “Business is good,” says Behre. “In my slum settlement I’m the only woman who wears nose rings and earrings made of real gold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b51a27b62088b43d809fccaabf2a14db7da223c/0_22_8851_7056/master/8851.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6a0e312ec86ab098c647fb225b639934 1240w","title":"the perfect shepherds pie recipe felicity cloake","story":"What could be simpler than lamb (always lamb) mince topped with mash? Yet even this domestic classic has a thousand variations. We cherry-pick the best to bring you an unbeatable shepherd’s pieThough they may not boast ancient pedigree, the two dishes are not as interchangeable as the likes of Martha Stewart – or indeed, and embarrassingly, the youthful me – would have you believe: just as roast lamb is not cooked in the same way as roast beef, shepherd’s and cottage pie deserve inidual attention. Having tackled the latter way back in 2010, when this column was still wet behind the ears, it feels high time we gave the shepherd his moment in the spotlight. Is this one of those dishes that’s so familiar you don’t need a recipe, or is there anything new to learn about shepherd’s pie?Originally, this was a dish designed to make the Sunday roast go further – the thrifty cook could stretch out the joint until Friday with clever cooking, and such pies were, and still are, often a Monday treat. Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham regard this as a second-best option, writing in The Prawn Cocktail Years that “there is no reason why a shepherd’s pie cannot also be made from a cooked lamb joint, but it turns out better and juicier when made from raw minced meat”.Tom Kerridge and Jamie Oliver clearly disagree, because they roast meat for the purpose: Oliver a lamb shoulder, cooked long, though not particularly low, and then slowly braised in its cooking juices and Kerridge lamb shanks. The testers are excited about these pies after I tell them how long they’ve taken to make, but confess themselves slightly thrown by their consistency, which is, they think, a bit stringy, though both lamb joints had plenty of fat on them.Even lamb mince can vary, however: Eastwood calls specifically for minced lamb shoulder, which she and my butcher explain is a fattier cut than some – and certainly better marbled, darker in colour and stronger in flavour than generic supermarket lamb mince. Whether this is down to the quality of the meat, the cut, or a bit of both is impossible to tell, because the packet stuff doesn’t specify origins, but this dish is certainly worth sourcing decent mince for: it’s never pricey (unless you go down the Ivy road and cut it with minced rib of beef, of course).If you don’t have any lamb drippings handy to cook it in (which you’re unlikely to, unless you’re making it with leftover meat), beef dripping makes a far better, meatier substitute than oil, adding an unmistakable whiff of animal to a dish that was never really going to make the vegetarian heart sing in any case.You can go rogue, if you like – the Ivy puts in shallots, Oliver red onion and Kerridge goes as far as garlic, but I prefer to keep things simple with the time-honoured trinity of yellow onion, celery and carrot, the last cubed, rather than grated as Hopkinson and Bareham suggest, because testers prefer the texture – though, sadly, they’re not keen on Oliver’s swede. I think it seems rather in keeping with the spirit of the dish, though I’d be tempted to bake it first to make it less watery.The Ivy and Eastwood both include mushrooms in their sauces, with the latter writing that many shepherd’s pies lack “depth of flavour. In poncy chef terms, it lacks umami. The mushrooms and mushroom ketchup give this recipe a savoury boost, as do the sun-dried tomatoes.” I agree with her: many recipes do indeed lack a bit of punch, but the testers aren’t keen on the texture of mushrooms here, however finely they’re chopped and the sun-dried tomatoes, though delicious, seem to belong to another dish entirely. “Too fancy,” apparently.But how to add umami without mushrooms or tomato? Meat stock seems the most obvious candidate: slow simmering the mince in lamb stock, as Brown and Hayley and Eastwood recommend, will deliver more savoury flavour than Bareham and Hopkinson’s water. If you can’t find good lamb stock, then beef stock is better than nothing (the Ivy’s veal stock will be, too).Tomatoes are also high in those all-important glutamates – the Ivy uses chopped tomatoes and tomato puree, and Eastwood, Bareham and Hopkinson ketchup, which has its fans, though I find it too sweet and vinegary. Everything ketchup touches ends up tasting of ketchup, so I’m going to use puree instead, plus a good dash of the Ivy’s Worcestershire sauce in place of the Prawn Cocktail Years’ anchovy essence and Kerridge’s red-wine vinegar, which gives his pie a tanginess that works very well with the richness of lamb and potato, but seems at odds with the culinary comfort blanket that is shepherd’s pie.A similar simplicity also seems wise in the herbs and spices department: Eastwood’s exotic star anise, Kerridge’s mace and the Ivy’s oregano are all great options, but you can’t beat thyme and rosemary with lamb.A good shepherd’s – or indeed cottage – pie, needs a solid, but fluffy top: too much milk or butter, and you’ll end up with a sloppy puree instead. Make sure you steam the potatoes dry before mashing, and season generously I like Bareham and Hopkinson’s nutmeg as well as the usual salt and pepper. If you’d like to increase the vegetable content, Eastwood’s butternut squash mash is wonderful, especially with the maple syrup to play off the natural sweetness of the meat, though there should be enough savoury flavour in the filling to negate the need for added cheese (though her parmesan works better than Oliver’s cheddar, and, inspired by Kerridge, I think a hard goat’s cheese would work best of all).Oliver lines his dish with potatoes, too, which I’m excited about – you can never have too much of a good thing – but the panel thinks it makes the dish too claggy, soaking up the gravy and blurring the satisfying distinction between molten filling and dense top. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs, if you think it needs extra crunch, but for me a shepherd’s pie needs no other adornment than its traditional crispy furrows, satisfyingly described by Dickson-Wright as “a ploughed field” of potato. And you don’t get much more rustic than that.2 tbsp good beef dripping (or lamb, if you happen to have some)800g minced lamb, goat, hogget or mutton, preferably from the shoulder, but anyway not “lean”1 large onion, thinly sliced2 large carrots, peeled and diced 3 celery sticks, diced2 sprigs each rosemary and thyme, leaves picked and roughly chopped1 tbsp flour300ml good lamb stock (or beef stock) 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp tomato puree1.5kg floury potatoes100g butter1 tbsp whole milkNutmeg, to grateHeat the fat in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish over a medium-high heat, then fry the meat in batches until crisp and well browned all over (not just beige).

Add the carrots, celery and herbs, and cook until tender but not soft. Sprinkle over the flour and stir well to distribute, then add the stock and Worcestershire sauce, and scrape the bottom of the pan to dislodge any stuck bits.Return the lamb to the pot, bring everything to a simmer, then cover, turn down the heat and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer uncovered for a further 15 minutes, then set aside to cool.While the meat is cooking, peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized chunks. Boil in well-salted water until tender, then drain well and return to the hot pan to steam dry. Mash with the butter and milk, then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.Spoon the meat mix into a 30cm x 20cm ovenproof dish, then cover with the mash. Smooth out the top, then use a fork to make furrows over the top – do not skip this stage. Bake for about 30 minutes, until lightly golden on top, then serve with greens.• Are shepherd’s and cottage pie interchangeable (having written this recipe without looking at my cottage pie of eight years ago, I find to my embarrassment the two are remarkably similar) and if not, what changes do you ring between the two?

But almost invariably each year there are anniversaries, whether musical or not, to celebrate, and provide some of the thematic threads – they may seem a necessary evil to some planners, perhaps, but they do provide a very helpful framework for others. Yet even though the 2018 season is the second the current director David Pickard has put together, it’s still not quite clear into which of those categories he falls.Inevitably it’s the centenary of the end of the first world war that looms largest over this new season. The tone of remembrance is set on the opening night, 13 July, in a concert by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and its chorus under chief conductor Sakari Oramo. It juxtaposes two works completed in 1918 – Vaughan Williams’ Toward the Unknown Region and Holst’s The Planets – with the first of this year’s Proms premieres. Anna Meredith’s Five Telegrams, based upon telegrams sent by young soldiers from the trenches in 1918, will be performed outside the Albert Hall, with specially commissioned digital images that will projected onto the walls of the Albert Hall.Elsewhere George Benjamin’s concert with the London Sinfonietta at the Roundhouse (21 July) will include the premieres of “first world war-themed works” by Luca Francesconi, Georg Friedrich Haas, Hannah Kendall and Isabel Mundry alongside 20th-century classics by Ives, Stravinsky and Messiaen. And the theme continues right through to the final week, when Britten’s War Requiem, with its settings of Wilfred Owen’s poems, arrives from Scotland with Peter Oundjian conducting the RSNO and its chorus (6 September).But as usual there’s a choice of composer centenaries to be marked too. The death of Debussy, already well noted elsewhere this year, still had to be noticed, including a semi-staged performance of his opera Pelléas et Mélisande, based on this summer’s new production at Glyndebourne (17 July). Hubert Parry, who also died in 1918, gets more than his usual exposure as the composer of Jerusalem on the Last Night (on 8 September, which sees the return of a familiar Proms favourite, Andrew Davis, to conduct), with performances of his Fifth Symphony (27 July) and the choral Songs of Farewell (Cadogan Hall, 20 August).Leonard Bernstein’s centenary, already widely celebrated in the UK, gets plenty of attention with concert performances of West Side Story and On the Town, both conducted by John Wilson (11 and 25 August), as the centrepiece. More intriguingly, the hugely talented Lili Boulanger, who died in 1918 at the age of just 25, and remains best known as the younger sister of Nadia – perhaps the most influential of all 20th-century composition teachers – finally gets her due as a composer in her own right, with performances of her mostly small-scale orchestral pieces dotted through the season.Though there’s plenty of evidence of the BBC starting to fulfil its pledge to have half of its commissions going to female composers by 2022, the new works this year seem something of a mixed bag. The UK premiere of Haas’s Concerto Grosso No 1 (30 July) features a quartet of alphorns, while the two most tantalising world premieres are both violin concertos. One (17 August) comes from Philip Venables, with the subtitle Venables Plays Bartók, which apparently harks back to the composer’s youthful violin lessons, in which Bartók’s Hungarian Sketches featured prominently. The other, from Norwegian composer Rolf Wallin, is the novelty in the Bergen Philharmonic’s concert with its music director Edward Gardner (21 August).The Bergen PO is part of the regular international parade of visiting bands that few other festivals in the world can match. This starts earlier in the season than usual, with the Minnesota Orchestra and Osmo Vänskä bringing an all-American programme on 6 August, while the previous day Thomas Dausgaard and the Swedish Chamber Orchestra bring their Brandenburg Project to the Albert Hall – two concerts interleaving Bach’s six concertos with six UK premieres, from composers including Mark-Anthony Turnage, Olga Neuwirth and Brett Dean. If a Proms visit from Daniel Barenboim and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra (14 August) is all too predictable now, then the chance to hear the Berlin Philharmonic with their music director designate Kirill Petrenko (previously a very rare visitor to the UK) in a pair of concerts is not to be missed (1 and 2 September), with Andris Nelsons and the Boston Symphony hot on their heels (2 and 3 September).Altogether it seem to be a Proms season designed to tick as many of the expected boxes as possible. There’s no sense of risk-taking, nothing that goes too far out on a limb – nothing particularly radical among new works, nor anything too ambitious or recherché among the standard repertory. And an awful lot seems packaged in easily digested, unthreatening morsels, a bit like too much of the daytime programming on Radio 3 nowadays.• Full details at www.bbc.co.ukproms, general booking opens 12 May.

But what are these self-styled traders really selling? By  Symeon BrownThe original Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, was a rogue trader convicted of fraudulently selling worthless penny stocks to naive investors. His biopic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the ostentatious, money-obsessed huckster, was a box-office hit in 2013. Although it may have been intended as a cautionary tale, to thousands of young millennials from humble backgrounds, Belfort’s story became a blueprint for how to escape an unremarkable life on low pay.Within months of the Wolf of Wall Street’s UK premiere in January 2014, a stocky 21-year-old named Elijah Oyefeso from a south London housing estate, began broadcasting on social media how much money he was making as a stock-market whizzkid. His thousands of young followers were desperate to do the same. As Oyefeso’s online fame grew, he caught the attention of TV producers. In January 2016, Oyefeso was featured in the Channel 4 show Rich Kids Go Shopping, in which he bought expensive jumpers to give to homeless people and showed viewers how easy it was to make stock trades online.Even before Oyefeso’s appearance on mainstream TV, his story had already gone viral. British tabloids, including the Daily Mail, the Evening Standard and the Mirror, as well as a host of online magazines targeted at young men, all ran pieces about his success. The Mail headline described him as a university dropout who supposedly used his student loan to start trading financial products online and “now claims he earns £30,000 on a BAD month – by working just ONE HOUR a day”.It’s an image of self-made wealth and ridiculous luxury, and one that Oyefeso has intensively cultivated online. The videos on his almost comedic YouTube channel, which have hundreds of thousands of views, feature him buying £250,000 cars and boarding private jets as nonchalantly as others his age might hail an Uber. His Instagram, which regularly shows him posing next to a blue and silver Rolls-Royce, describes him as the founder of DCT, his trading firm. DCT stands for “Dreams Come True”.“I’m never going to work for someone,” Oyefeso says in one of his videos, in a somewhat cartoonish, nasal voice, while he drives his Rolls dressed in a bathrobe. “Look what I’ve built: a foundation. A brand.”For many young people from areas such as the poorer part of Camberwell in south London where Oyefeso grew up, or those who have come across him on social media, Oyefeso’s portrayal as a self-made millionaire has given him the heroic status of a footballer or rapper.“I’m just a normal guy and most people who come from where I’m from, they see if I can do it, they can do it,” Oyefeso told me. He has described DCT Trading as a future Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan – except, unlike those mammoth financial institutions, which tend to recruit from a narrow pool of elite graduates from prestigious universities, Oyefeso appeared to be opening a closed door to young people who might otherwise be excluded from the trading floor.Oyefeso has sent out thousands of invitations with the message “join my team”. The problem is, his company does not have a trading floor. It does not have an office. Dreams Come True isn’t registered at Companies House. It does not exist as anything more than a website and some social media accounts. (Oyefeso claims the parent company, Gabs Fossard Ltd, is registered, although it was dissolved without posting any income.)Oyefeso is one of the most high-profile figures of an internet subculture that reveres Jordan Belfort and has taken his Wolf of Wall Street persona to social media. Posing as ultra-wealthy kids and posting internet memes taken from the movie, its followers aggressively sign up young people to what looks like an international pyramid scheme that has helped to generate billions of pounds for large companies selling highly risky financial trading products.They are the wolves of Instagram.The financial sector has a genius for creating new products that brush against the law. A former UBS trader told me that the sector had taken advantage of the grey area between what they know they can’t do and what they believe they can get away with. In 2008, as the economy reeled under the weight of trillions of dollars of bad debt in financial products called collateralised debt obligations, another risky and obscure proposition was being designed for the public: the binary option.The concept is simple: you sign up with a minimum deposit of £250 from a debit or credit card, click a button that says you are over 18, then bet on whether the price of a stock, currency or other financial security will go up or down and by how much. The binary option is part of a family of similar financial products such as spread betting and contracts for difference. If you have ever heard a rookie investor declare that they trade currency, these are probably what they are talking about.These products became popular alongside a proliferation of online trading software and mobile betting platforms. The craze was largely driven by two countries – Israel and Cyprus – in the late 2000s. Their regulatory frameworks meant that firms could access European markets without the heavy hand of European regulators, and new binary options companies spread like chain letters. After the financial crash, in Israel alone an estimated 100 firms popped up in the space of a few years.Over the past 18 months, these financial products have taken great leaps into public life with expensive marketing campaigns. Plus500, which is to online trading what McDonald’s is to fast food, is the main sponsor of European football giant Atlético Madrid, and 24Option have sponsored the renowned MMA fighter Conor McGregor and Italian football team Juventus.Binary options are considered so volatile that they have been banned outright in the US. However, in the UK, which has some of the most liberal financial regulations in the world, they were until January of this year classified as high-risk gambling products and regulated by the Gambling Commission. Since then, they have been under the auspices of the FCA, which published a list of unauthorised firms and guidelines for aspiring traders.The mystery is how such complex products became an internet youth craze. And this is where the wolves of Instagram swagger in. Oyefeso described himself as a social media “influencer”, which means he and others like him can use Instagram and Twitter to sell the trading platforms a supply of teenagers and young adults with limited knowledge of the money markets and a hunger for success.This is how it works. Oyefeso posts images of luxury goods he claims to have bought with his winnings. He gives the pictures hashtags such as #richkidsofinstagram and mass-follows young people online. One teenager told me he and his friends were drawn in by the sight of a young black man who grew up on a council estate similar to theirs, driving a Rolls-Royce. As soon as anyone follows Oyefeso back, he slides into their DMs with a message: “I’m offering a great opportunity to earn £100-400+ per week from trading, no experience required, all done from home and only requires 15-30 min per day.” If you’re young, poor and want to defy the odds against you, the next question is: where do I sign up?What wolves like Oyefeso fail to declare is that each of the trading platforms you sign up to (with a minimum deposit of £250) pays him around £40-80 – and that recruitment, rather than betting on these predatory financial products, is the way he makes his risk-free money (Oyefeso maintains he’s making money from trading). Young people join the platforms, make a few trades and can lose anything between £250 and several thousand pounds, then realise they can make it back by repeating the trick: becoming a paid marketing affiliate masquerading as a successful trader. It looks like a vintage pyramid scheme, rebooted for the social media era using a model of e-marketing that has boomed over the last 20 years.It is almost impossible to count the number of marketing affiliates masquerading as successful traders on Instagram, but we can count the number of promotional posts they’ve made using hashtags such as #binaryoptions (222,206), #traderlifestyle (64,151), and #richkidsofinstagram (529,574). Those numbers rise by the minute and the thousands of accounts generating them appear and disappear constantly.The companies making the real money from these financial gambling products are supposed to be kept in check by the ASA, the Gambling Commission and the FCA – but this pack of regulators appears to be outfoxed by the wolves. The National Fraud Authority estimated that £59m had been defrauded from UK residents in 2017 from binary options alone.“These binary options are almost no-win gambling products masquerading as complex financial instruments,” Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, one of a number of politicians who have issued warnings about such products, told me. “It’s outrageous they are being targeted at the most vulnerable gamblers and young people.”Many of the most exploitative companies’ digital storefronts drift anonymously in the middle of the internet, virtually undiscoverable to people who don’t know they are there and aren’t looking for them. This is where the influencers and their social media accounts come in. In Oyefeso’s words: “I just saw a big hole and I filled it up, which any successful entrepreneur would do.”My first meeting with Oyefeso was on a summer’s afternoon in 2016. He and some of his friends were parked up on a private housing estate in Canary Wharf, having arrived in a convoy of supercars, including Oyefeso’s Rolls and a rented Audi R8. The neighbourhood was meant to serve as a backdrop to the world of opulence they were displaying on their Instagram feeds. It was not long before a resident came out to tell us we were trespassing. “This is a private estate, we don’t want to associate this estate with those kinds of people,” he said.Instagram – even more than Facebook or Twitter – is where people sell a version of their lives that they want people to believe. None more so than these young, self-proclaimed millionaires. They are part of the larger phenomenon of #richkidsofinstagram, a hashtag first used in 2012 to profile the genuine heirs of multimillion-pound estates – including a son of one of the West Ham football club owners – but then spread to people like Oyefeso, who were faking it. A search of the posts tagged #richkidsofinstagram reveals young men and women from across the world sharing pictures and videos of their extravagant lifestyles: suitcases filled with stacks of £10, £20 and £50 notes toddlers wearing customised Gucci denim jackets expensive cars and private jets, all set to the latest hip-hop anthems.For Oyefeso and many of his friends, the lifestyle is largely a costume drama. In his most recent video on YouTube Oyefeso appeared to hire a private jet – one that was parked up – to announce his return after he left prison. Oyefeso recounted how much money he could make in 15 minutes. Yet in reality, the only company I could find registered to Oyefeso’s address – IWANTTOTRADE Ltd, was dissolved in 2016 without posting a penny of income. Despite his glamorous trappings, Oyefeso, the son of Nigerian migrants, is, on paper at least, still residing at their council flat in south London.In reality, #richkidsofinstagram is mostly a feed of adverts selling everything from clothes to gambling products, featuring endless marketing affiliates trying to recruit young people who are under more and more pressure from friends and influencers on social media to buy their way to success. The @richkidslondon account, followed by more than 730,000 people, says it profiles the most impressive rich kids, but what it does not say is that it charges them £60 for a post or £350 for 10.According to a close friend, Oyefeso got his start in this world in 2014, when he began working at One Two Trade (OTT), a bucket shop operated out of a backstreet office in Wapping, east London, where unwitting investors could register bets online. OTT, which is not a regulated financial institution in the UK, but registered in Panama and Malta, would take a cut of every trade, and then try to hustle investors out of the rest of their money using excessive commissions and other exploitative terms. Former staff describe it as overrun with young people who had lost money on the platform, trying to make it back by signing up their friends with trading accounts.For young people with ambition but no access, who were attracted to the risk, ingenuity and wealth of investment banks and hedge funds but would not qualify for a job at a traditional Canary Wharf company, working at OTT felt like a genuine career in the City – despite being unpaid. Oyefeso began styling himself as a guru offering “signals”, or trading tips, while working as a marketing affiliate. According to one of his mentees, he was a frontrunner in a burgeoning scene of young black outsiders, most of whom knew each other, spinning stories about how they infiltrated the old white man’s world of finance.On Oyefeso’s website there is a section where he recommends a range of financial betting platforms. He also showed me a WhatsApp group he charged thousands of young people a £69.99 monthly fee to join, which would instruct them on what to bet on next. Unbeknown to his “clients”, they were the product he was selling.The flashy Instagram may have won him a following, but the biggest gift to Oyefeso was his TV appearance. “After Rich Kids Go Shopping, he was so exposed,” one of his close friends said. “Before, it was just a small black community that was going to him, people that wanted to make quick money would go to him, but when he got put on the TV he had clients in Scotland.”I asked Oyefeso who started the traders of Instagram subculture. “Without being cocky, I think I did,” he said. Without Oyefeso to “show people that you can have this, that you can buy this house, that you can buy this car”, there might not have been the traders of Instagram business model. A rival who copied him agreed. “It started from Elijah,” she said. “He was putting it all on social media. When they are seeing a young black man buy a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce and who is constantly on TV and he’s getting a lot of publicity, they’re thinking, what is this guy doing? I want to be involved.”Then came a binary options gold rush among one of the most unlikely of demographics – young people in Britain’s inner cities.Oyefeso marketed for a range of legitimate companies, including 24Option and AvaTrade, registered in Cyprus and Ireland, respectively, which have an estimated combined annual revenue of nearly $90m. (Neither company responded to a request for comment.) Oyefeso also introduced his young audience to Banc de Binary, a company he describes as “fully good”, even after it ceased trading amid fraud allegations.Banc de Binary was founded in 2009 in Israel. The man at the helm was a former Israeli paratrooper, Oren Shabat Laurent. At its peak, the company had a yearly revenue of $100m, making it a star among binary options companies. The firm sought respectability by sponsoring football teams such as Liverpool and Southampton, but both clubs dropped the company when it become embroiled in scandal.Banc de Binary faced a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits from clients, and was pursued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It was fined $11m for major regulatory breaches such as using shell offices in the UK and the US to evade financial regulations. The company was kicked out of the US in 2013, and was denied access to European markets when it lost its licence in Israel soon after that. In January 2017, the company ceased trading when it was revealed to have used software rigged against its users. Its founder, Laurent, has since reinvented himself in the world of cryptocurrency, with a bigger online following than any of the influencers who peddled binary options for him. Laurent did not respond to requests for comment.Part of what made Oyefeso and Banc de Binary’s practices so ruthless was the age of the people they were signing up. In the UK, you have to be 18 to gamble or speculate on financial transactions. But Oyefeso was openly targeting much younger teenagers. It appears that in doing so, he was violating advertising regulations on gambling products.When I spoke to Oyefeso before he went to prison, he did not exhibit much regret. “I’m not going to lie to you, there are some people under 18 who trade and use their parent’s name,” Oyefeso told me. I asked him if he had worked with anyone under 18 directly. “Of course,” he said. Aren’t you breaching the rules? I asked. “If I am, why aren’t I behind bars?” he said.It seems Oyefeso didn’t just see teenagers as a source of income. They were also a source of labour. I spoke to one 18-year-old who told me that when he was between 15 and 16, he received a message from Oyefeso telling him he could sign up to a trading platform using his mother’s details. Oyefeso then offered the boy and his school friends work running his social media accounts and messaging his followers with advertising scripts. The teenagers were paid a cut of the commission for every one they signed up.The pack of Instagram wolves has spread far beyond Oyefeso’s network in London. Twenty-three-year-old Eddy Samuel grew up on the outskirts of Manchester. The city has received billions in private and public investment, but Samuel was not well placed to benefit from the new jobs that new money created.“I hardly got any GCSEs,” Samuel recently told me. “I got one Btec. I never really had an education.” After a string of minimum-wage jobs, he did some landscape gardening. “That was my last ever job,” he said. Together with two friends, he was drawn into the supposedly glamorous Instagram-world of fast cars and designer clothes that young men the same age as them appeared to have. The pressure to join them was almost torturous.“We are all from council estates – every single one of us,” Samuel said. “Seeing other people do it and wanting to get involved in it ourselves, being broke. I’m out of a job, we’re like – we need something else to get things going.” The company they launched, called Trading XL, has never been registered at Companies House.Even those losing money on Banc de Binary and other platforms sometimes gained a sense of self-confidence and an identity they felt proud of. Young men soon started trading in their hoodies for three-piece, pinstripe suits even though they had no office to wear them to. The subculture even had an anthem. A one-time Instagram trader who goes by the handle 10KJunes released a rap track called Trading Life, which includes the line, “I be selling stocks and then I buy it back, I got the taxman thinking that I’m selling crack”.Technology has made some jobs extinct and endangered entire sectors, but in a tough jobs market, affiliate work seems like the most accessible route to money. There is no interview or licence required. All that is needed, in most cases, is an email address and a bank account. The marketers earn on commission only, so they provide a growing class of cheap labour.A decade ago, teenagers primarily used social media to keep up with their friends and interests. In 2018, many see curating their accounts as a career and there is a growing ecosystem making this a major challenge for advertising regulators. Adverts are supposed to be identifiable, but influencers blur the lines with account pages built as shop windows on their lives. This grey area allowed foreign firms reliant on UK-based influencers to operate with impunity. Experts suggest that the regulators could have gone after marketing affiliates as “facilitators of gambling” sales, but chose not to.Plus500, which is valued at over £1bn, has an estimated 100,000 marketing affiliates working for it alone. The @dailyforexsignals account on Instagram appeared to be promoting the company with posts that the Campaign for Fairer Gambling claimed were in breach of the guidelines. However, Plus500 said the account had signed up just eight clients and the company had long cancelled @dailyforexsignals affiliation. It says it offers customers a test to indicate they understand the terms of trading, and has measures to ensure protection of its customers, including limiting the amount clients can lose. It says it requires all affiliates to comply with industry standards, but it is difficult to see how a company such as Plus500 keeps tabs on the thousands of unmanaged digital workers making it money. This in turn makes it hard to stop it profiting from vulnerable consumers – in particular, from young people hooked in by the promise of easy wealth.In 2005, the Labour government liberalised gambling advertising and created the Gambling Commission to regulate commercial gambling and protect vulnerable people, including anyone under 25. Tom Watson, the current deputy Labour leader, admitted that the legislation didn’t take the digital era into account.“The yield taken from losers in the industry has gone up from £8bn in 2008 to £13bn in 2016,” Watson said. “That’s a lot of money, and when you combine that with recent news that companies are targeting the most vulnerable people who are susceptible to becoming problem gamblers – I think we’ve got a problem and our current regulations and laws are not fit for purpose.”Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, alleges that the wolves’ Instagram posts are breaching two ASA regulations, “the first of which is: you can’t market to young people, and the second is: gambling cannot be offered as a way of making money. So these adverts would never pass the regulators if they were conventional.”The Gambling Commission has admitted that it had received a growing number of complaints when it was in the process of trying to regulate binary options, but the Campaign for Fairer Gambling says neither it nor the ASA had taken strong enough action on the advertising of such profits to vulnerable young adults. The Gambling Commission acknowledged it had never even “written to Instagram relating to advertisements or posts promoting gambling, that breach the UK advertising codes” during the time of the steepest rise in complaints.Both regulators blame the 2005 legislation. The Gambling Commission said that although binary options were regulated, the rules only applied if the firm had “remote gambling equipment located in Great Britain, irrespective of whether there are offices in GB or not”. The law states that if equipment is not in Britain, any binary options that the firm offers will not be regulated. Last month, the European Securities and Market Authority decided to prohibit the sales of binary options and limit the marketing and distribution of related products to vulnerable retail consumers. However, the wolves of Instagram have already adapted their behaviour.“Everything is changing, so obviously I’ve got to change, too,” Oyefeso said to me last year, when the landscape began to shift.One of Oyefeso’s business associates has leapt headfirst into the latest gold rush. “I recently got into bitcoin about three months ago,” he said. “Young people have just jumped to it and it’s like the (binary options) trading bubble all over again.”The cryptocurrency craze is in many ways similar to the boom in binary options and digital gambling apps. There have now been over 1,560 different currencies launched. Most of them are worthless but a host of new platforms are trying to hawk them via dubious platforms that entice young people through marketing affiliates disguised as Instagram influencers.One of Oyefeso’s early proteges was a north Londoner called Olivia James, 23. She described the original Wolf of Wall Street as “a king in my eyes”, and in February tweeted “I’m do everything Belfort done and more lifestyle wise”. Hoping to take advantage of the popularity of bitcoin, James has now incorporated a new company called TRADEtoGAIN, with 20-year-old Armon Rabiee and 24-year-old Luke Arliss. The trio share a common story with many of the other young people founding pop-up sites to teach young adults how they can crack cryptocurrencies, for exorbitant fees. Arliss struggled at school, James was repeatedly turned down for entry level jobs in the City and Rabiee said he lost thousands during the binary options wave as a teenager. Together, they plan to make money as gurus of crypto.Arliss, who has a big Instagram following from his former company, which repaired bodywork on footballers’ cars, said that he gets “loads of messages” about crypto from young people “interested in the hype”. Rabiee piped in, claiming that with their special insight they “can charge people thousands”.As Oyefeso’s fairytale has unravelled, the internet has turned against him. People shared reports of his arrest and sentence with mocking comments, and published blogs accusing him of running scams. Oyefeso responded with a caption on a recent video post: “People don’t want to see a young black guy from the ends make it out to be successful,” he wrote.The problem, in Oyefeso’s case, has not been a lack of goodwill. There were many who shared his original rags to riches story, unaware that there was another version in which this apparently wealthy young trader was an invention, incentivised by companies happy to exploit the gap between the life millennials are persuaded they should be living, and the harsh economic reality they live in.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a365c05e50641630dde577819ee718ce05ebab/0_0_3886_2675/master/3886.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5577e49bc12dc03948def4b4bad9b0 660w","title":"backbench mps motion force vote eu customs union","story":"Three Tories among signatories demanding option of customs union kept on table after BrexitTheresa May next week faces a show of support from MPs fighting to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, after 10 select committee chairs tabled a motion that will force a vote on the issueThe Conservatives Bob Neill, Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, are among the signatories to the motion, which urges the government to “include as an objective in negotiations ... the establishment of an effective customs union”.The government lost a vote in the Lords on Wednesday night by a hefty majority of 123, on a cross-party amendment that would force ministers to report to parliament on their moves to keep the UK in a customs union.MPs campaigning against a hard Brexit, including Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna, have tabled amendments to the trade bill and customs bill demanding that the option of a customs union be kept on the table.But the government has so far delayed bringing the legislation back to the Commons, avoiding the risk of an embarrassing defeat. So the select committee chairs are using their power to raise issues in the Commons to force a vote.Other signatories include Labour’s Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Norman Lamb, and the Scottish National party’s Angus MacNeil.Those wanting to remain in a customs union – which would avoid border checks, but constrain the UK from striking its own trade deals – are concerned about the impact on the economy if the UK left.The motion “notes the government’s expressed aim to provide the freest and most frictionless possible trade” with the EU and “further notes the importance of frictionless trade without tariffs, customs or border checks for manufacturers and businesses”.Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, and Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, said: “With just six months to go before the Brexit deal needs to be concluded we are running out of time for parliament to help to shape the negotiations. “Yet many of our backbench committees have forensically gathered evidence on different Brexit options and the practical implications. That is why committee chairs at the liaison committee – including those who voted leave and who voted remain, supporters and opponents of a customs union – concluded that backbench MPs should get the chance of an early constructive debate and vote on this crucial issue, not bound by the party whips, but informed by committee evidence instead.”They added: “If parliament stays silent until after the deal is done, that is just a recipe for conflict and regret later on. Far better for us to debate this properly now and let parliamentarians express their view before it is too late.”The vote will be non binding, but after the defeat in the Lords on Wednesday, its proponents hope it will demonstrate that there is no majority in the Commons for leaving the customs union, something May has insisted on since her Lancaster House speech last January.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “This is further evidence of the growing chorus of cross-party voices concerned that Theresa May’s position on a customs union is wrong in principle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2a3ce5c060a8a8aa49f979764b9d30f95c761d/0_79_5294_3176/master/5294.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a7e474c805d00b239faffccc0f727f83 1240w","title":"registering eu citizens uk needs proper strategy migration policy","story":"Thinktank says ministers need to step up plans to ensure 3.4 million people sign up to stayThe government needs to be far more ambitious in its plans to register the estimated 3.4 million EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, with outreach programmes in pubs, schools, hospitals and libraries, a thinktank report has said.The Migration Policy Institute Europe recommended “outreach strategies” such as updating official guidance, but also allowing Britons in Europe and EU citizens in the UK to register to stay in “a range of accessible and familiar settings” which are less intimidating than official forms.Without proper handling there could be a large “unauthorised population of Britons left without legal status” after Brexit, it said, warning that this could also encourage fraud.It raised particular concern for Britons settled in the EU, noting that while Theresa May has been “forced to show her hand” and come up with a post-Brexit plan for EU citizens, this is not the case in other member states.“Many EU countries have yet to begin planning for issues likely to affect their UK nationals after Brexit, with officials interviewed in a number of member states reporting they are unsure of whose remit these Britons will fall under,” the report said.The report comes as the EU raised fresh concerns about the treatment of its nationals after Brexit.The European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said MEPs would be vigilant about the rights of EU citizens after Brexit, following a growing row about threatened deportations of people who moved to Britain from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 1960s.The Brussels-based MPI recommends that governments should consider working with leading behavioural insight specialists to develop innovative ways of increasing registrations. It says member states need to make sure they are not disqualifying people who are eligible to remain in the company of their choice, by forcing them to document their history in the country. “Retrospective requirements in which applicants are asked to track down documents to prove their work, residence or family status in the past, could lead to large-scale denials.” As EU citizens who migrate start the clock on their permanent residency rights just three months after their move, it suggests that current documents would be enough to demonstrate eligibility.The Home Office has said it will reveal more details about its registration system in the summer, but has promised “a new, streamlined, user-friendly scheme for EU citizens”.It has also said it is “committed to ensuring that applications will not be refused on minor technicalities and that caseworkers processing applications will exercise discretion in favour of the applicant where appropriate”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a6a514bdb40cccf802d5e8484558b7344a5afbe/0_57_2519_1511/master/2519.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0261011d3d755c03b1dff95492c357db 1240w","title":"gove says brexit has helped make uk most immigration friendly country in eu politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenMichael Gove’s memory must be failing him. He claimed today to be a champion of liberal and welcoming migration policies, yet the Vote Leave campaign that he chaired engaged in disgraceful scaremongering about Turkey being on the verge of joining the EU.He also claimed the Brexit vote didn’t lead to worse communal relations, despite their being overwhelming evidence to the contrary, including an official Home Office report which found a sharp spike in hate crime.The reality is that this Government’s obsession with meeting its arbitrary net migration target by delivering an extreme Brexit is damaging lives, hurting businesses and the NHS, and shredding our international reputation.If true, these are deeply concerning revelations. The fact that a Tory donor could be allowed to potentially subvert the system will look bad to taxpayers who play by the rules. The Tories have serious questions to answer on this matter, and I hope the chancellor immediately comes forward to explain this behaviour by HMRC and ensure there was no undue pressure exerted by Conservative Party politicians or officials.Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said the ill-fated renewable heat Iincentive (RHI) scheme was not a “personal priority” for her and she wishes she had asked more questions about it. As the Press Association reports, Northern Ireland’s former first minister and former enterprise minister told the public inquiry into Stormont’s botched green energy scheme that she had a “false sense of security” due to the scheme “working” in Great Britain. She also said she was “surprised” that her special adviser, Dr Andrew Crawford, had shared government documents about the scheme with his farmer cousin, and defended the part-time role he currently has with the party. Foster was in charge of the planning of the scheme in 2012 before a series of fatal design flaws in the green subsidy project exposed Stormont to a huge overspend, paying out more than it cost to buy wood fuel. She told the inquiry: “It’s very difficult for me to go rooting about in a department to find out what isn’t being brought up to me.” Asked whether she felt she should have done more “rooting around”, Foster said:Through hindsight, of course one wishes that I had asked more questions in relation to the renewable heat incentive scheme. But putting myself back at that period of time, as I think I’ve indicated on a number of occasions, it wasn’t a personal priority of mine within the department. I had other personal priorities. It doesn’t mean I wasn’t interested - before somebody writes that tomorrow.A backbench debate on vaginal mesh is taking place in the Commons this morning, brought forward by Emma Hardy, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle, following growing concerns about the safety of such surgery.Hardy says she remains “deeply concerned” that the mesh has not yet been completely suspended and new mothers are still not given universal access to physiotherapy, as happens in France, which could substantially lower the prevalence of problems such as stress urinary incontinence and prolapse, which mesh surgery is used to treat.Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston calls the effects “devastating”:More on Michael Gove and whether or not the UK is the most immigration-friendly country in the UK - if you are still interested.Gove’s office has finally got back to me. I quoted some figures earlier (see 11.18am) which broadly back up Gove’s claim. His adviser, however, has directed me to another chart, in this Ipsos MORI report (pdf) looking at international attitudes to immigration. The UK comes out better than any of the other EU countries in the table - although there are only eight other EU countries in the table, meaning that 19 are not included.The table lists countries according to how people respond to a question about whether immigration has had a positive effect on their economy. Saudi Arabia comes top, which highlights how data like this can be potentially misleading. Saudi Arabians may feel very positive about the contribution made to their economy by immigrant labour, but most people would not view the country as a beacon of tolerance and liberalism.And that takes us to the crux of the problem: when Gove said the UK was “the most immigration-friendly country in the EU”, what did he mean?As argued earlier, if Gove is referring to immigration-friendly neighbours, then his argument more or less stands up (see 11.18am) (unless the migrants happen to have the misfortune of ending up living next to Nigel Farage.)If you judge the UK government by asylum applications (a very narrow measure of immigration, but an important one), it also looks very unwelcoming by EU standards.Senior backbenchers are going to force a Commons vote on staying in the customs union next week.It will be a vote on a backbench motion, which means that it will not be binding on the government and - if precedent is anything to go by - Tory MPs will just be encouraged to take the afternoon off instead of voting in the the ision.But the debate will allow pro-Europeans in the Commons to mount a show of strength. And, crucially, it will establish whether there are seven or more Tories willing to vote for staying in the customs union - enough to defeat the government customs union amendments to legislation get put to a vote later in the spring.The motion has been tabled by 10 select committee chairs. Two of them, Labour’s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Nicky Morgan, have written a joint blog for HuffPost explaining why they back staying in the customs union. They write:With just six months to go before the Brexit deal needs to be concluded, we are running out of time for Parliament to help to shape the negotiations.Yet many of our backbench committees have forensically gathered evidence on different Brexit options and the practical implications.That is why committee chairs at the Liaison Committee – including those who voted leave and who voted remain, supporters and opponents of a customs union – concluded that backbench MPs should get the chance of an early constructive debate and vote on this crucial issue, not bound by the party whips, but informed by committee evidence instead.As two of those chairs, we both believe the case for a customs union is overwhelming - for the sake of British manufacturing, international trade, smooth borders and Northern Ireland peace.Cooper has posted a text of the motion on Twitter.Here is the key passage.This goes further than the customs union amendment passed by the House of Lords last night, which just urged the government to explore the option of staying in the customs union in the Brexit talks. (That amendment seemed to leave open the possibility of the government coming back and saying, having looked at it, it concluded customs union membership was a bad idea.) This motion doesn’t say the UK would definitely remain in the customs union it just sets that as an objective.Nick Timothy, who worked as Theresa May’s policy adviser when she was home secretary and then in Number 10 until after the general election, has used his Telegraph column (paywall) to write about the Windrush generation crisis and to defend (mostly) May’s record. Here are the key points.In the case of the Windrush generation – the people who came to Britain between 1948 and 1971 on their parents’ passports – the department has been slow to realise there was a systemic problem, rather than a handful of tough cases.This reads like a mild dig at Amber Rudd, who replaced May as home secretary in 2016.So ministers are right to make Britain a harder country to live in for people who are here illegally. In recent years, they have made it more difficult for illegal immigrants to rent property, get a job, claim benefits and obtain bank accounts and driving licences. Even sceptical studies find that this increases the number leaving the country voluntarily: ministers should not reverse the policy, but extend it to include other services.Labour want to blame Tory “callousness”.The trouble with this explanation is that the approach began under Labour home secretaries. In 2007, John Reid said “living and working here illegally” should become “ever more uncomfortable and constrained”. Under Alan Johnson, the Border Agency said it would “make the UK a hostile environment” for illegal immigrants.As home secretary, Theresa May was criticised for the notorious “go home or face arrest” vans that were deployed in 2013. In fact, she blocked the proposal, but it was revived and approved in a communications plan while she was on holiday. She killed off the scheme later that year, but by then the damage had been done.My colleague Heather Stewart previewed the Labour housing announcement overnight. Here is the text of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech at the launch this morning. Here is a Guardian article about the plans by John Healey, Labour’s housing spokesman. And here are the main points from Corbyn’s speech.Over the coming months we will go even further, throwing everything we can into building council capacity so that once again they can build on the scale that’s needed. It will mean a new era of social housing, in which councils are once again the major deliverers of social and genuinely affordable housing and set the benchmark for the highest size and environmental standards.When the post-war Labour government built hundreds of thousands of council houses in a single term in office, they transformed the lives of millions of people.People emerged from six years of brutal war to be lifted out of over-crowded and unhygienic slums into high quality new homes and introduced to hitherto unknown luxuries such as indoor toilets and their own gardens.Setting new benchmarks in size and energy efficiency, something that old council stock still does to this day council housing was not a last resort but a place where people were proud to live.Today’s challenges are different but the ambition needed is the same.Today, Labour set out our plan to turn this around and it involves two simple steps: build enough housing and make sure that housing is affordable to those who need it.That’s why we have promised today that the next Labour government will deliver one million genuinely affordable homes over ten years, the majority of which will be for social rent.Housebuilding has been in steady decline for decades, from over 350,000 a year at the beginning of the 1970s to well below 200,000 today. The only times we have built enough affordable housing is when councils have stepped up.We know by now that we cannot rely on arms-length incentives for private housebuilders, building for profit to solve the crisis.As they themselves openly acknowledge, it is simply not profitable for them to build houses for the less well-off. We need to do it ourselves.At the heart of the housing crisis we face today, is that housing has become a means of speculation for a wealthy few, leaving many unable to access a decent, secure home.As a country, we have lost the principle that a decent home is not a privilege for the few but a right owed to all, regardless of income. Let today mark a turning point, from which we start to get it back.The only way to do it is through social housing. And that’s what a Labour government will deliver. At the launch of Labour’s housing green paper Jeremy Corbyn reaffirmed his determination to tackle antisemitism in the party. He said:It’s disgusting, it’s appalling, it’s completely unacceptable in any place whatsoever in our society. I am determined along with others to completely root it out altogether in our society ...We are acting very rapidly on improving our procedures and ensuring that all those who have committed any kind of abusive act are brought to book.There wasn’t a live feed of his speech, but I’ve now got the text. I will post a summary shortly.Sunder Katwala, who runs the British Future thinktank, which focuses on migration and identity, says Michael Gove was right to say that British attitudes towards immigration have become more tolerant since the referendum.On his Twitter feed Katwala flags up various bits of research that back up this view.Rob Ford, an academic specialising in this topic, looks at the evidence in this Medium article. He cites various sets of data, but the key figures are probably the ones in this chart.Here’s the impacts data. This comes from the British Election Study panel fielded by YouGov on a regular basis to a very large representative sample of respondents. The panel regularly asks people whether they think immigration is good or bad for the economy, and whether they think it enriches or undermines cultural life.There is a big, sustained jump in the share of positive responses on both of these measures after the Brexit vote (shown by the red dashed line). Immigration optimists now significantly outnumber pessimists on the economic measure, while on the cultural measure optimists and pessimists are now balanced. Before Brexit, pessimists were the larger group on both measures.And he questions why this might be.Why has this change happened? Immigration policy hasn’t changed, and while migration levels have dropped somewhat, they remain high by historical standards and a long way above the government’s “tens of thousands” net migration target. The vote to leave the EU didn’t change anything on its own. Yet voters across the political spectrum seem to have taken it as a cue to worry about immigration less, and appreciate it more. Why?Michael Gove had an answer on Today - although, as I pointed out earlier, hate crime figures tell a different story. (See 10.19am.)Here is the chart from page 41.And this is what the report says about these findings.UPDATE: See my post at 1.50pm for more on how Gove’s claim can and cannot be justified.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been at the heart of the City this morning pledging a “new start” for Labour’s relationship with the finance industry, though he warned that bankers may not like Labour’s policies on income tax, corporation tax or a financial taxation tax.McDonnell said that Brexit was one issue where Labour and the financial services industry had aligned interests, saying the party was disappointed that economic factors had fuelled the leave vote. He said:I think few people now dispute that these economic failures also contributed to the vote for Brexit in 2016, which we deeply regret.His speech, which launched a Labour conference at the finance giant, is the latest in his efforts to court the City, having spoken earlier this year in at Davos and held regularly private meetings with investors and asset managers. Opening in the speech, he joked that he was not “a raving extremist who is about to nationalise their company and send them on a re-education course somewhere up north.” Labour, he said, would be “open and transparent about our plans ... There are some policies that you will like and some of which you will be less enthusiastic about.”However, he said, Labour would be “a radical, progressive, intervening government” and said the “hands off” approach would not deliver the growth the UK needed. He said:We made it clear that Labour in government will intervene to shape the economy, and that willingness to intervene naturally includes the financial sector.McDonnell said he wanted to get the City onboard with Labour’s plans. “There are no tricks up my sleeve,” he said. When we go into government, we want you to come with us, alongside representatives from our manufacturers, our trade unions and wider civil society. There will be a seat at the policy making and policy delivery table for you. That’s the tone I have tried to engender at the many meetings I have had in the City.Here is a full summary of the main points from Michael Gove’s interview with Today.That is not the way the views of Conservative ministers on immigration have always been characterised. To cite just two example: Theresa May’s speech to the 2015 Conservative party conference, proposing “a tough new plan for asylum”, was roundly condemned as hostile and anti-immigrant. And Gove himself was accused of “stoking the fires of prejudice” when he was running Vote Leave campaign and it put alarmist claims about Turkish criminals and the threat they would pose to the UK if Turkey joined the EU at the centre of its campaign.The striking thing is that, however people want to characterise the Brexit vote, and I do respect the reasons why people were so passionately attached to remaining within the European Union, the characterisation of it as somehow having led to worse communal relations or a more hostile attitude to migration - that just isn’t borne out by the facts.The British people have a robust and pragmatic and liberal approach. They want to welcome people here who want to work. They want to make sure that people who come here contribute fully. But they also want to temper that with compassion towards those who are fleeing persecution.The striking thing is that Britain, like other countries - Canada, Australia - which have control of their borders, is a country which, because we have control, is capable therefore of exercising generosity.However, an official Home Office report says the opposite. A statistical bulletin published last year called Hate Crime, England and Wales, 201617 (pdf) said:The EU referendum campaign began on Friday 15 April 2016, with the result announced on Friday 24 June, the day after the referendum. Around this time there was a clear spike in hate crime. As stated in the introduction, offences with a xenophobic element (such as graffiti targeting certain nationalities) can be recorded as race hate crimes by the police. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in these types of offences around the time of the EU referendum.The increase in hate crime can be seen by using racially or religiously aggravated offence data. As mentioned in the Introduction, the police can record offences as being racially or religiously aggravated. While not covering all hate crime offences, these offences make up over 70 per cent of race and religion hate crime ...There was an increase in these offences from April 2016, which reached a peak in July 2016. The number of aggravated offences recorded then declined in August 2016, but remained at a higher level than prior to the EU Referendum. These increases fit the widely reported pattern of an increase in hate crime following the EU referendum, with the level of these offences being 44 per cent higher in July 2016 compared with the previous July. That phrase has been paraded around as though it were somehow emblematic of Britain. It’s not ...My view is that what is emblematic of Britain is the welcome that we gave the Windrush generation, the welcome that we gave the people fleeing Idi Amin in the 1970s, the welcome that we continue to give those fleeing persecution. And also the fact that now, outside the European Union, we can have a truly colour-blind migration policy that, if the British people want to, treats people from the Bahamas in the same way we treat people from Bulgaria.I have never heard anyone make that comparison before Lord Kerslake did. It is not for me to criticise a distinguished former public servant like Lord Kerslake, but I respectfully disagree.I think Amber Rudd has taken a grip of this issue. I think she has done exceptionally well to focus Home Office attention on it. I think the gracious way in which she apologised to those affected was a model of how a politician should react to a situation like this.We are perfectly clear that we are going to ban these plastic items. The purpose of this consultation is to make sure that when we do bring in that ban - and we want to bring it in at pace - that we have it properly.Good morning. Theresa May is attending the formal opening of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting today. But the controversy about the government’s treatment of Windrush generation immigrants continues to dominate the headlines. Here are the latest overnight developments.This was a very contested piece of legislation across government departments ... There were some how saw it - I shan’t name them - as almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany and the way it’s working ... Some ministers were deeply unhappy.Kerslake was probably referring predominantly to Lib Dem ministers.The peer, who now advises the Labour party, also called for an investigation into who authorised the destruction of the Windrush landing cards.Something very striking was reported by the European Union, actually, a little earlier this year, which is that of all the countries in the EU, Britain is the country with the warmest attitude to migration from outside the EU. We’re the most immigration-friendly country in the EU ...In the aftermath of the Brexit vote, there were all sorts of people who said that it was motivated by darker feelings. The truth is that the Brexit vote allowed the British people to say ‘Look, we’ve taken back control, we can now determine what migration policy is in our interests and we can combine both what’s in our economic interests with proper humanity.’ And the really striking thing now is that Britain has the most liberal attitude towards migration of any European country. And that follows the Brexit vote.And I think the characterisation of this country and its people by some as somehow - all sorts of language has been used that I won’t dignify by repeating - I think that is wrong, and I think we can see in the national conversation that we have had about the Windrush generation that people are so glad that this country has had a tradition of welcoming people from abroad.Here is the agenda for the day.9.15am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech at a Labour half-day conference on the future of the finance sector.10am: Jeremy Corbyn speaks at the launch of a Labour green paper on housing. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports, he will say that a Labour government would rip up the government’s definition of affordable housing and instead bring in a measure linked to people’s incomes.11am: Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, gives a speech on “taming the tech titans”.And the Queen will formally open the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, where Theresa May has announced that cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics could be banned from sale in England next year in the next phase of the campaign to try to halt the pollution of the world’s rivers and oceans.As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

But the cow skull, dating to at least 3,000 BC and found at the neolithic site of Champ-Durand in France, is the earliest example of such surgery on an animal.While removing part of the skull is a technique sometimes used in modern medicine to control pressure following a head injury that causes bleeding in the brain or brain swelling, the purpose of its precursor, trepanning, has been hotly debated, with some suggesting it was used as some sort of medical intervention, and others that it was a part of rituals.The cow skull is the earliest clear example of trepanation on an animal – while a wild boar skull with a hole, apparently made by cranial surgery, was reported in 1948, Ramirez Rozzi says it is not clear how old that skull is. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Ramirez Rozzi and co-author Alain Froment say they dismissed previous conclusions that the hole in the cow’s skull, which at its largest measures about 6.4cm by about 4.7cm, was made in a violent tussle with another cow as there was no sign of fractures or bone splinters. There was also no sign that it was the result of an infectious disease or a tumour.But careful examination showed the hole had the same sort of scrape marks as are seen in human skulls which have been trepanned. The team also found there was no sign that the hole had begun to heal, suggesting that it was made either when the cow was on its on its deathbed, or had already died.The researchers say it is unclear why the hole was made, but that there are two main theories: either stone age humans were honing their skills for making holes in the heads of their peers, making the latest find the earliest evidence of animal experimentation or the hole is the earliest evidence of some sort of veterinary procedure and was carried out in an attempt to save the cow’s life.In the latter case, the authors say, the intervention would likely have been a response to a behaviour change, possibly seizures, suggesting that neolithic humans had made the link between the brain and such problems.However Ramirez Rozzi said the idea of a neolithic vet is the less likely of the two options: the cow was one of many and the animals were eaten for food. “I don’t see why they would save the one cow in the middle of hundreds of cows,” he said.

Matches would be 20 balls shorter than traditional Twenty20 contests.“This is a fresh and exciting idea which will appeal to a younger audience and attract new fans to the game,” said Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive. “Our game has a history of innovation and we have a duty to look for future growth.”“Based on fifteen traditional six-ball overs, the other ten balls will add a fresh tactical dimension,” added Sanjay Patel, the ECB’s chief commercial officer. “Crucially, this will also help differentiate this competition from Vitality Blast and other T20 competitions worldwide.”Speaking to Sky Sports News, England bowler Stuart Broad defended the plans. “I’m hugely optimistic,” he said. “I love the fact that it’s different to all the other tournaments worldwide – 15 six-ball overs and then the pressure of a 10-ball over to finish.“I love the fact it’s got a slightly different unique selling point in there, a shorter game than T20, finishing at 9pm – perfect for children and families and a great night out.”Last year, the ECB announced a £1.1bn broadcast deal with Sky and the BBC, with 10 games from the new tournament to be shown live on terrestrial television.Lord’s and the Oval are expected to host separate teams with Southampton, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Cardiff and Nottingham also selected as venues for the five-week competition, which starts in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/935f942135de59fe562d7bc1bf6a9feb09e9ae54/53_60_5799_3480/master/5799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83a5c10007bf43c5a8cf31d50be777e2 1240w","title":"whats the best email service that doesnt scan emails for ad targeting","story":"Jim doesn’t want his emails scanned for targeted ads, but while there are ways to avoid it, surveillance-based advertising is rifeWhat’s the best free email service provider that does not scan or use the data in your emails for advertising? JimFree email services are usually paid for by showing you advertisements. Some email services scan your emails in order to show you personalised or targeted ads. You could argue that that’s a benefit, because you’ll see ads in which you might have some interest. You could also argue that your emails are private, so it’s an invasion of privacy. Either way, it’s different from scanning your emails to stop viruses and phishing attempts, which nobody wants to stop.There are several options, but the problem is bigger than you may think, and likely to get worse.When Google launched Gmail in 2004, it did indeed scan your emails for advertising purposes. You could only avoid it by using a paid-for version of the service. That changed last summer, when Google announced that it would no longer scan emails to tailor adverts.That didn’t mean you would get adverts picked at random. As Alex Hern explained here, “the adverts will now be targeted in the same way as other Google services, based on information gleaned from other activity on users’ profiles, such as their searches, browsing activity, and even physical locations”.Google has the world’s largest known tracking system, thanks partly to Google Analytics – which is used on far more websites than any Facebook tracker – and its DoubleClick advertising business. Add Google Search and it already knows so much about you that scanning your emails may well be superfluous. The good news is that you can delete a lot of it, with the help of a Guardian article by Dylan Curran: Here is all the data Facebook and Google have on you.The problem is that Google has lots of other reasons to read your email, and you may find some of them useful. For example, Google might tell you about traffic jams or flight delays, put appointments in your calendar, or offer to write quick email replies for you. These features involve AI software reading your emails, tracking your website visits, and your location. In the future, it may include information from home speakers (Google Home etc), household gadgets (Nest etc), fitness bands, smartwatches, cars (Waymo) and other connected devices.As AI gets smarter, there will be more and more opportunities for companies to track you, profile you, and help you.In other words, scanning emails to tailor advertising is a relatively minor issue in the great scheme of things. The larger problem is that the whole web economy is based on surveillance, and there’s very little you can actually do about it. Even if you try to stay anonymous and block cookies, you might be identified by techniques such as device profiling, fingerprinting, and AI systems that can recognise your typing.Neither of the two largest email services – Google’s Gmail and Microsoft’s Outlook.com – scans your emails for advertising purposes. If you want to avoid those, Zoho Mail is a good alternative. It’s primarily aimed at business users, and includes an online office suite and other features. It offers a free service with 5GB of mail storage space, so you can try it. You may find it’s worth paying €24 per year for 30GB of storage and other features such as domain aliases and Microsoft Active Sync support.ProtonMail, which is based in Switzerland, is one of the most privacy-conscious email services, and offers encrypted and self-destructing emails. However, it only provides 500MB of storage to non-paying users. ProtonMail Plus costs €48 per year for 5GB of storage, while ProtonMail Visionary costs €288 per year for 20GB. You’d be more likely to use this as a supplementary service than for all your emails.FastMail is a popular alternative, because it offers good support with no ads and no tracking, but it’s not free. The Basic service with 2GB of storage costs $30 per year, while 25GB costs $50 and 100GB costs $90 per year. There’s a 30-day free trial so you can test it first, and a migration guide to help you switch from another supplier.Most people now access their email service via a web browser. The pre-web alternative was to use an email client program to download new emails to your PC. If you use an email client then you won’t see any targeted adverts even if your emails are scanned.In the old days, email programs used POP3, the Post Office Protocol. The software downloaded your emails then deleted them from the mail server. This has mostly been replaced by IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), which downloads emails and leaves them on the server, unless you delete them deliberately. This means you can download the same emails to several PCs, or read them online with a different smartphone, tablet or PC, etc.Email programs have fallen on relatively hard times, and Microsoft has discontinued the Windows Live Mail program that was popular with Ask Jack readers, (although it still works). This is partly because devices may already include a mail app, and the Mail and Calendar app in Windows 10 is actually pretty good for most users. It supports multiple accounts, not just Outlook.com, and there are companion Outlook apps for Android and Apple smartphones.Alternatives include Mozilla’s free and open source Thunderbird, which runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux, and Windows programs such as Mailbird and eM Client. Mailbird Lite is free but you can get Mailbird Pro for $39 (or $19.50 at the time of writing). eM Client is free for non-commercial use but there’s a Pro version for £35.94.Business users tend to use Microsoft Outlook, which is one of the main Office programs. Outlook is not included in the Home and Student edition, but you could pick up a cheap version of Office 2016 Professional. Alternatively, you could subscribe to Office 365 Personal (£$59.99 per year for one user), or Office 365 Home (£$79.99 per year for five users), and download it. Each Office 365 user gets 1TB of storage, which makes it economical.The online advertising industry has a self-regulatory body called the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which offers advice to consumers. There’s also the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a non-profit organisation that describes itself as “the leading self-regulatory association dedicated to responsible data collection and its use for digital advertising”.The NAI has an “opt out” page, which sets an opt-out cookie that will be respected by NAI members. You will still see ads, but most will not be targeted ads. It offered me the chance to opt out of targeted ads from 90 members, including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. You have to run it in every browser you use.You can also install the EFF’s Privacy Badger andor the open source Ghostery browser add-on. Privacy Badger tries to enforce Do Not Track if you have that turned on in your browser.Another idea is to use Firefox’s first-party isolation (FPI) feature, which Mozilla has adopted from the Tor browser. To turn it on, paste the following into the address bar and set the top preference to True:This may create log-in problems so it’s better to use an extension instead.A more practical idea, currently, is to use a Firefox container to isolate a particular site. Mozilla offers a Facebook Container extension, which makes it easy. The full Multi-Account Containers extension lets you keep any site – or group of sites – separate. It was designed to let you, for example, log into two or more different accounts on one service in the same browser at the same time. However, you could use a container to isolate Gmail or any other service.Have you got a question?

Here, writers, rangers and guides reveal their favourite spotsExploring Britain and appreciating the charms of its incredible landscape wasn’t always a top priority for me. Like many, I ignored what was on the doorstep as I rushed abroad. Which is nothing new. Celia Fiennes, an early pioneer of the Great British road trip, argued in the 17th century that we should all get out more and explore our homeland to “cure the evil Itch of overvalueing fforeign parts”.Her words ring truer now than ever. In my case, it took a trip to the other side of the planet to jolt me out of my complacency. Back from New Zealand, raving about its scenery, I was swiftly put in my place by a friend: “Haven’t you been to the Highlands of Scotland?”I hadn’t. But since then, I’ve been making up for lost time. Glen Coe, one Britain’s most dramatic landscapes, is popular, being only 30 minutes from Fort William but it’s big enough to feel properly wild, with empty Rannoch Moor providing a suitably contrasting backdrop to the mountains. Some friends and I recently enjoyed a night’s bivvy at the top of Buachaille Etive Mòr, the iconic mountain, but not without incident.A large bird, possibly in league with Satan, tore into our food supplies while backs were turned and then cackled at us all the way down the hill the next day. An incredible place for a night’s sleep but consider bringing a scarecrow. Humphrey Butler, publisher of the Joyously Busy Great British Adventure Map (£14.99, marvellousmaps.com)While northern Dartmoor is beautiful and hilly, the south is vast open moorland with no one around, and Duck’s Pool is one of its remotest parts. We call it the Bermuda Triangle because a lot of Duke of Edinburgh groups tend to get lost there – it’s featureless, boggy and sometimes misty, so can be disorientating and a bit scary. It’s not for the fainthearted and you need to know how to navigate, but the solitude and beauty make it a wonderful place – you can walk for several hours across open terrain.For me, it’s real Dartmoor, the high moorland that only hardier walkers see. It is the site of one of the first “letterboxes”. Letterboxing is a hobby dating back to the 19th century, where walkers follow clues and document their experience by stamping a visitor’s book kept in a “letterbox”. This letterbox is also the site of a memorial stone for William Crossing, who wrote Crossing’s Guide to Dartmoor. John Diplock, director Dartmoor-based activity operator Spirit of AdventureMam Nick is the road that climbs steeply from Edale to Mam Tor, deep within the Peak District national park. The road looks pretty straightforward in cycling terms but once the overhanging trees disappear, the road swings lefts over the Noe river and kicks up twice, hardly giving you chance to appreciate the spectacular views of the valley towards Win Hill. As the road snakes around, there are great views of Back Tor, Lord’s Seat and Kinder Scout behind you, if you care to stop for a breather.I first discovered this route on my bike in 2009 and was surprised how quiet it was compared with the hum of tourists and traffic at better-known Peak District attractions. The road is quiet throughout the week, and used mainly by ramblers and walkers at weekends. The only sound is the occasional call of a red kite or buzzard. Perhaps this is because you won’t find it written on a map – only locals call it Mam Nick.It is one of the toughest cycling climbs and, in the opposite direction, one of the most exhilarating descents in Derbyshire, on what is left of the abandoned Shivering Mountain (Mam Tor) road and the hair-raisingly steep Winnats Pass. Both roads boast amazing views back towards the Hope valley. Thom Barnett, founder of Sheffield-based clothing company MamnickFrom the start of the drive from Llandovery (the nearest town, 10 miles away), you sense that you’re delving deep into the rugged heart of the Cambrian mountains, a truly undiscovered gem of Carmarthenshire. Gwenffrwd–Dinas is an RSPB reserve, set up to protect the habitat of this ancient Atlantic oak woodland. It covers 600 hectares and is best experienced on a circular walk over a couple of hours.Initially, the trail runs alongside the still-infant Towy river, which, even in the driest season, roars across the rocks through the gorge from its source at Llyn Brianne as it cuts through the mystical oak and alder woodland. Use the steps cut out of boulders to take on the challenge of finding the well-hidden cave of Twm Siôn Cati (the Welsh highwayman). The feeling of tranquillity and isolation is spectacular, as red kites, pied flycatchers and tree pipits soar overhead. My favourite time in Dinas is May, when bluebells cast a violet haze over the valley.Alan Warner, countryside rangerThe Lakeland landscape can be ided into four parts, each feeling and looking quite different. The east shifts from scoured fells to woody limestone crags. The south-west is spacious, wild-valleyed and overlooked by the scowling buttresses of England’s highest mountains. The north-west is all jumbled, knuckled hills plunging to lake-floored vales. Then there’s the far north. There are no lakes here. No roads. Here the fells swoop and bulge, looking more Scottish than English. Unbroken by the gapes of crags, it’s Arctic-esque in the snow, pristine white rolling into white.You can lose yourself in 100 sq km or so. It is rampart-edged and slashed by valleys, with a high central keep. Caught within the encircling noose of roads are familiar fells – Skiddaw, Blencathra – and odd, unfamiliar names: Dead Crags, Thief Gill, Trusmadoor. It’s not impenetrable: the Cumbria Way splits on the way in, running around its centre like a moat. There’s even a bothy, in awesome isolation. I’d tell you where but no explorer wants directions.Hesket Newmarket lies to the north, a stone village with the Old Crown pub serving beers named after the local fells: Brim Fell, Old Carrock, High Pike.You couldn’t call any part of the Lakes a wilderness in itself. But by night, under cloud, or in winter, this is as wild a place as you’ll find. Simon Ingram, editor of Trail magazineLand’s End is one of the busiest places in Cornwall. Yet just a mile to the south along the South West Coast Path, and two miles north of popular Porthgwarra, is a bay of towering cliffs and caves that has two names: Nanjizal and Mill Bay. I love exploring this one-mile stretch of heathland and disused copper-mining shafts, along a mainly vertiginous footpath between two craggy granite promontories. These headlands are called Carn les Boel and Carn Boel, and the latter is my favourite, with remnants of an iron age settlement.Here I can be alone and observe seals, seabirds and peregrines rearing their young. On a clear day in May, you’re immersed in yellow gorse, orange lichen, aquamarine sea and the light and dark browns of granite glinting with feldspar. I often bring my walking guests to this bay, where we sit up high, on one side or the other of Carn les Boel, depending on the wind direction, watching the breaking waves with the sound reverberating around the bay. On extreme low tides, a walkable sand bar appears.Paul Simmons, founder of walkitcornwall.co.ukSprawled across the counties of Derry and Tyrone, the Sperrins are Ulster’s wildest land. The thickest sheets of the last ice age scoured these mountains into smooth undulations that banner the skyline. But don’t be fooled by gentle curves – the Sperrins’ heart is vastly bleak.Begin by following my favourite road through the foothills to Banagher Glen’s ancient forest of oak and ash. Here, having evaded St Patrick’s banishment, Ireland’s last serpent lurks in a pool swollen by the Altnaheglish and Glenedra burns. Climbing, the forest thins to mountain bog stretching across the uplands. The view pans to the Foyle Estuary. From Sawel, the highest peak in the range, you can gaze east all the way to the Mournes, and to Binevenagh on the north coast.Then turn around. There’s an aching wilderness of montane heath loping to the interior. With soaring buzzards to guide you, trek the lengths of eskers skirting peat-dark tarns and pools. If rough ground speckled with summer’s bog cotton keeps your eyes lowered, you’ll spy cloudberry and sundew among the coarse grasses and heather. But meadow pipit and wheatear will draw your gaze skyward to where a peregrine might slice it.Or you’ll stumble into the neolithic. Monuments, like Clogherny Wedge Tomb, cued by boulder erratics, litter the moorland with standing stones and circles. Heading west, past the Mullaghs, old bog roads descend to the glacial valleys of Glenelly and Owenkillew patchworked by gorse-seared hill-farms. Further pockets of forest shelter red squirrel and pine marten. As ravens acrobat in the wind, you could fancy you hear the howls of one of the last Irish wolves: mac tíre – aptly the son of the country – still haunting his tundral domain. Mary Montague, poet and author of Tribe (Dedalus Press, £9)If you want wild and remote, head to Handa, off the Sutherland coast. It’s not far from the North Coast 500 route, which is attracting growing numbers of visitors, but as an island we are one of the most isolated spots along this coastline. We look out of our bothy on to nothing, just mountains. Handa was last inhabited in 1847, when the islanders were relocated to Nova Scotia (voluntarily). Now it is an internationally important breeding site for seabirds, protected by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Much of the island is surrounded by spectacular sandstone cliffs, which provide nesting sites for fulmars, kittiwakes, one of the UK’s largest guillemot colonies and 200 pairs of puffins. But on the east side, there are pristine beaches and sand dunes. Inland, the boggy moorland is home to the great skua, or bonxie as it’s known here. Most people arrive by ferry from Tarbet on the mainland (April-Sept, handa-ferry.com) but it is possible to kayak over and wild camp – if you check with the rangers first. • scottishwildlifetrust.org.ukCraig Nisbet, ranger, Handa island Don’t be put off by images of people and trains chuffing up Snowdon – Snowdonia is one of Britain’s greatest wildernesses, second only to Scotland’s Cairngorms in size and emptiness. My favourite part is the northern Rhinogs, where I lived for many years, and which has rugged bony peaks, high tarns and glimpses of the Irish Sea. is an abundance of bronze age sites linked by a prehistoric track, recently christened the Ardudwy Way, that once connected Ireland to Britain via the natural harbours of the coast.Standing proud like a crown of thorns is Bryn Cader Faner, a spectacular stone circle thought to be a prince’s burial cairn. From here, a network of lakes and tarns spread out and buzzards soar around the lonely granite top of Moel Ysgyfarnogod, or hare mountain. The glacial Cwm Moch valley drives a scar to the north, descending into the precipitous gorge of Llennyrch, among some of finest examples of Atlantic rainforest in Europe. Mosses and lichen drape the sessile oaks, bilberries abound and walkers can bathe in a Narnia of waterfalls and pools.Daniel Start, co-author of Wild Guide to Wales and the Marches (Wild Things Publishing, out 1 May, £16.99)Between the stunning north Norfolk coast, a stone’s throw to the north, and the commercialised Norfolk Broads to the south, lies the best-kept secret in Norfolk: the Bure valley, with the beautiful river Bure meandering through it. The clear waters are home to numerous aquatic creatures, from shoal upon shoals of silvery darting fish to lobster-like crayfish crawling across the river bed. You may spot the iridescent flash of a kingfisher patrolling his “beat” and in search of his next meal, the unmistakable stream of fizzing bubbles as the elusive otter speeds off into the distance, or a Chinese water deer at the river’s edge.A footpath runs alongside the river for about nine miles from Aylesham to Coltishall, and the Bure Valley Steam railway roughly follows the same route, so you can walk one way and get the train back. Much of the river is privately owned so there are few boats on it, and it’s quite possible to canoe for two days and not see another soul. To have that tranquility just two hours from London is incredible.

Among the other items in the 10-strong range are barbecue-and-smoked-onion crickets, and pasta and granola created with creepy-crawlies.“The idea is to offer customers the most innovative products and provide an alternative assortment of items that are sustainable and respectful of the environment,” the chain said in a statement.“These products have been produced entirely in Europe and boast the highest quality standards.

As the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation points out, however, insect consumption is hardly a novel phenomenon in many parts of the world. “From ants to beetle larvae – eaten by tribes in Africa and Australia as part of their subsistence diets – to the popular, crispy-fried locusts and beetles enjoyed in Thailand, it is estimated that insect eating is practised regularly by at least 2 billion people worldwide,” the organisation said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230bc025b53c27dedb0f6011412735d3e2a6d82b/0_223_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a43bb2ca43881e9a32568e01c6c664e0 1240w","title":"island of no return vanuatu evacuates entire population of volcanic ambae","story":"Thousands of south Pacific islanders will leave for permanent resettlement, government says, as Manaro spews ash 30cm deepThousands of south Pacific islanders at the mercy of an active volcano will be permanently resettled by the end of May, the Vanuatu government has said.Ambae Island is home to 11,000 people, and for the second time in six months Ambae’s Manaro volcano on top of Mount Lombenben has started rumbling, spewing torrents of ash and gas from its crater and burying vegetable plots and crops, causing breathing and health problems for locals, and threatening their lives and livelihoods.People living in the north, west and south of the island are worst affected by the ash and began being evacuated on Thursday after a state of emergency was declared on Tuesday. Ash as deep as 30cm had already settled on many parts of the island, and people were experiencing breathing difficulties, skin reactions and illnesses such as chest infections as they waited to leave.One Ambae resident, Nadia Kanegai, said islanders were frightened and could not wait to get away. “And there was a gas emission as well. So the people are scared.”A local priest said the situation was “desperate” for locals as food supplies and animal feed were beginning to run out, water was contaminated by ash and disease was spreading among the evacuees, most of whom are subsistence farmers.Police and some aid agencies are already in place, with the army expected to arrive later this week to orchestrate the mass evacuation which this times looks to be permanent. “In times like these, it is always the vulnerable sections of our communities being the women, the children and the elderly, that are most affected,” Avio Roberts, national coordinator for the Vanua’aku party, told the Vanuatu Daily Post newspaper.Negotiations are under way between landowners and central government to acquire land for Ambae evacuees on either Maewo or Pentecost – the two closest islands to Ambae, but a safe distance from the volcano, which is one of the most active in the world.“People’s lives must be our first priority,” said prime minister Charlot Salwai during the October evacuation, in which planes, ships and barges were used in the DIY effort.Vanuatu is no stranger to natural disasters, and the the south Pacific nation was rated the most at-risk country in the world in a 2016 UN study. Its 83 islands are stuck in the middle of hurricane alley and they dot the border of the “ring of fire” – a belt around the Pacific prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The Australian government provided AU$3.2m to support early recovery efforts for those affected by the Ambae volcano last year, and is ready to give further assistance, a spokesperson said.

As a result, Castro will remain the most powerful person in Cuba for the time being. His departure from the presidency is nonetheless a symbolically charged moment for a country accustomed to 60 years of absolute rule first by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and, for the last decade, his younger brother.Facing biological reality but still active and apparently healthy, Raúl Castro is stepping down as president in an effort to guarantee new leaders can maintain the government’s grip on power in the face of economic stagnation, an ageing population and increasing disenchantment among younger generations.An electronics engineer by training, Díaz-Canel became party chief in his home province of Villa Clara in the 1990s. In 2003, he was moved to be party chief in Holguin province, a centre of Cuba\u0027s burgeoning tourism industry and foreign investment. In 2009, he was summoned to Havana to be higher education minister, and in 2013 Castro appointed him as first-vice president. Since then he has stood in for Castro at political events, received foreign dignitaries and travelled abroad on behalf of the government.\u0026nbspDíaz-Canel\u0027s policy views remain mostly an enigma in a country where political campaigning is banned. On the one hand he is from a younger generation of leaders and has advocated modernising Cuba on the other he is a longtime Communist party apparatchik who is not expected to push for sweeping political change.As a young provincial party chief, he bucked party orthodoxy by backing an LGBT-friendly cultural centre in Santa Clara, reportedly listening to rock music and sporting long hair. At a national level, he called for more critical coverage of events in state-run media and broader internet access to open one of the world\u0027s least web-connected societies.\u0026nbspUltimately though, he appears to have earned Castro\u0027s trust by sticking to the party line on key political and economic issues, analysts say.While Díaz-Canel\u0027s public persona has been reserved, even dour, since he joined the national government nine years ago, residents in his home province of Villa Clara enthuse about him as a handsome, friendly man of the people who gets things done.\u0026nbspFuel was so scarce in the 1990s that he cycled to work wearing shorts instead of commuting by Soviet-made Lada like other party leaders, locals said. He has also been lauded for backing the Santa Clara culture centre at a time when homophobia was commonplace in the party.\u0026nbspA music lover, Díaz-Canel would reportedly bring his two children from his first marriage to the centre\u0027s youth events, dancing there himself in the evenings. Reuters“I like sticking with the ideas of President Fidel Castro because he did a lot for the people of Cuba, but we need rejuvenation, above all in the economy,” said Melissa Mederos, a 21-year-old schoolteacher. “Díaz-Canel needs to work hard on the economy, because people need to live a little better.”“We’re building a relationship between the government and the people here,” Díaz-Canel said after casting a ballot for members of the National Assembly. “The lives of those who will be elected have to be focused on relating to the people, listening to the people, investigating their problems and encouraging debate.”Díaz-Canel gained prominence in central Villa Clara province as the top Communist party official, a post equivalent to governor. There, people described him as a hard-working, modest-living technocrat dedicated to improving public services. He became higher education minister in 2009 before moving into the vice presidency.In a video of a Communist party meeting that leaked to the public last year, Díaz-Canel expressed a series of orthodox positions that included pledging to shut some independent media and labelling some European embassies as outposts of foreign subversion.But he has also defended academics and bloggers who became targets of hardliners, leading some to describe him a potential advocate for greater openness in a system intolerant of virtually any criticism or dissent. International observers and Cubans alike will be scrutinising every move he makes after he officially takes office on Thursday.Two years after taking over from his ailing brother in 2006, Castro launched a series of reforms that expanded Cuba’s private sector to nearly 600,000 people and allowed citizens greater freedom to travel and access to information. He has failed to fix the generally unproductive and highly subsidised state-run businesses that, along with a Soviet-model bureaucracy, employ three of every four Cubans. State salaries average $30 a month, leaving workers struggling to feed their families, and often dependent on corruption or remittances from relatives overseas.Castro’s moves to open the economy have largely been frozen or reversed as soon as they began to generate conspicuous shows of wealth by the new entrepreneurial class in a country officially dedicated to equality among its citizens.“I don’t want to see a capitalist system, hopefully that doesn’t come here, but we have to fix the economy,” said Roberto Sanchez, a 41-year-old construction worker. “I’d like to have more opportunity, to buy a car and have a few possessions.”State media went into overdrive on Wednesday with a single message: Cuba’s system is continuing in the face of change. Commentators on state television and online offered lengthy explanations of why Cuba’s single-party politics and socialist economy are superior to multi-party democracy and free markets.Fidel Castro was president from 1976 until he fell ill in 2006, having previously led the country since the 1959 revolution as prime minister. Osvaldo Dorticos was president from 1959 to 1976 but was considered a figurehead beside the man who forged Cuba’s single-party socialist system and ruled by fiat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a00879b0b0fdd2953922b81e494cd685f5284a/0_57_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b67d1a91c16e5705a0ec15333aa47384 1240w","title":"north korea wants complete denuclearisation says seoul","story":"South Korea’s president says Pyongyang has not attached any conditions such as US troop withdrawalNorth Korea has expressed a desire for the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula without attaching preconditions such as the withdrawal of US troops, the South Korean president has said.The statement, unconfirmed by North Korea, comes before a summit between the leaders of the two countries on 27 April, to be followed in May or June by a meeting between Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and Donald Trump.The US president on Wednesday pledged to meet Kim “in the coming weeks” but said he was prepared to walk away if the talks were not fruitful.The key question at any summit between Trump and Kim is whether the North Korean leader is serious about dismantling his regime’s nuclear weapons, and what he would demand from the US in return.The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, told reporters that North Korea had not “attached any conditions that the US cannot accept, such as the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. All they are expressing is the end of hostile policies against North Korea, followed by a guarantee of security.”There has never been a summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, though Bill Clinton came close to agreeing to meet Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2000.“As you know, I will be meeting with Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” the US president told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “Hopefully that meeting will be a great success and we’re looking forward to it.”North Korea has defended its weapons programmes, which it pursues in defiance of UN security council resolutions, as a necessary deterrent against perceived US hostility. There are 28,500 US troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war.North Korea has said over the years that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the US removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear deterrence umbrella from South Korea and Japan.The North may have found a way to make a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile, but firing one at the South is likely to provoke retaliation in kind, which would end the regime.\u0026nbspPyongyang has enough conventional artillery to do significant damage to Seoul, but the quality of its gunners and munitions is dubious, and the same problem – retaliation from the South and its allies - remains.In the event of a non-nuclear attack, Seoul\u0027s residents would act on years of experience of civil defence drills, and rush to the bomb shelters dotted around the city, increasing their chances of survival.South Korea announced on Wednesday that it was considering how to convert a decades-old armistice with North Korea into a full peace agreement. Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Moon said he saw the possibility of a peace agreement and even international aid for North Korea’s economy if it denuclearises.Trump confirmed this week that Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, had travelled to North Korea to meet Kim, paving the way for Trump to hold the summit.The mission, which came shortly after Pompeo was nominated as secretary of state, was the highest level meeting between the two countries since 2000, when Madeleine Albright met Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, in Pyongyang. It also marked the first time Kim Jong-un had met a senior western official.Speaking at a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Trump said: “We’ve never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it’s father, grandfather or son, and I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don’t think it’s going to be successful, we won’t have it, we won’t have it. If I think that it’s a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we’re not going to go.“If the meeting when I’m there is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting and we’ll continue what we’re doing or whatever it is that we’ll continue, but something will happen.”Abe said no reward should be given to North Korea just because the country was responding to dialogue over its development of nuclear weapons. “Maximum pressure should be maintained,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34c4a2067532001b5fd823d044fdda0fb84c9f28/0_214_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=72b8e1f96d9a950f5cdadc5c6362fb87 1240w","title":"recep tayyip erdogan turkey president election dictator seeks total control","story":"Turkey’s president is unlikely to lose an election that will make him more powerful than AtatürkRecep Tayyip Erdoğan is one of a crop of present-day political leaders who value the respectability an ostensibly democratic election confers but don’t want to risk actually losing the vote.In this respect, Turkey’s president is no different from Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Egypt’s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Their shared idea of democracy can be summed up by the motto: “You vote, I win.” It is possible Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) could lose the snap presidential and parliamentary polls called for 24 June. But it is extremely unlikely. The AKP won a clear majority of seats in parliament in 2015 and is already assured of the support, should it need it, of the Nationalist Movement party (MHP). On 16 April 2017 Turkish voters narrowly approved a package of constitutional amendments granting President Erdoğan sweeping new powers.The amendments will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system – arguably the most significant political development since the Turkish republic was declared in 1923.Under the new system - which is not due to take affect until after elections in June – Erdoğan will be able to stand in two more election cycles, meaning he could govern as a powerful head of state until 2029.\u0026nbspThe new laws will notionally allow Erdoğan to hire and fire judges and prosecutors, appoint a cabinet, abolish the post of prime minister, limit parliament’s role to amend legislation and much more.The president\u0027s supporters say the new system will make Turkey safer and stronger. Opponents fear it will usher in an era of authoritarian one-man rule.\u0026nbspErdoğan has sidelined old comrades such as Abdullah Gül and Ahmet Davutoğlu, formerly president and prime minister respectively, ensuring nobody within the AKP is in a position to rival him. And since the failed 2016 coup, he has systemically emasculated rival power bases and independent media, locking up pro-Kurdish lawmakers and journalists and sacking tens of thousands of civil servants, academics, military, police and judges on specious grounds of national security.In such circumstances, the prospect of truly competitive, open, free and fair elections is slim to non-existent. In a very real sense, Erdoğan, himself a one-time prison inmate who came up the hard way, has been waiting for this moment all his life. If and when he wins, he will assume the full powers of the new “executive presidency” that was narrowly voted through in last year’s bitterly contested constitutional referendum.Elections had not been due for another 18 months. By bringing the polls forward, Erdoğan is finally set to gain full, personal control of all key aspects of domestic and foreign policy. He will become a dictator in all but name, more powerful perhaps than even Kemal Atatürk, modern, secular Turkey’s founding father. Worried politicians in Paris, Berlin, London and Washington no longer see a reliable friend and ally in Ankara. They see an autocratic figure exploiting nationalist and neo-Islamist sentiment, xenophobia and Europhobia, and feelings of public insecurity brought on by next door’s Syrian crisis, to justify egregious human rights abuses, institutional vandalism and anti-EU, anti-western policies.Turkey under Erdoğan, though still a Nato member, is now closely aligned with Russia. In Syria, Erdoğan has backed Moscow and Tehran in pursuing a political and territorial settlement that would keep Bashar al-Assad’s regime in place, even though he had previously demanded the Syrian leader resign.In return, Moscow gave tacit support to Turkey’s recent military incursion into Afrin, in north-west Syria, in furtherance of Erdoğan’s obsessive vendetta with the Syrian (and Iraqi) Kurds – all of whom he denounces as terrorists. On past precedent, inflammatory anti-Kurdish rhetoric will play a big part in Erdoğan’s re-election bid. The need to be “strong” in Afrin was one reason for calling early polls, he said on Wednesday. Putin and, for example, China’s Xi Jinping, another executive president-forever, may be impressed by Erdoğan’s dubious ascendancy. Iran’s hardliners may cheer him on. But the western democracies, which Turks for many years aspired to emulate, will not. For them, Turkey is increasingly on the wrong side of a global argument between freedom and control."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a6e1f073ae15c28862716aca445646fb79233ee/0_23_4722_2833/master/4722.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5758c3e777ae8122a389f556715b2000 1240w","title":"southwest explosion aviation authority orders mass engine inspections","story":"Directive requires ultrasonic inspection of fan blades on CFM56-7B engines that accrued certain number of flightsThe US Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the inspection of 220 jet engines after investigators said a broken fan blade touched off an engine explosion on a Southwest Airlines flight, shattering a window and killing a passenger. The order, called an air-worthiness directive, would require an ultrasonic inspection within the next six months of the fan blades on all CFM56-7B engines that have accrued a certain number of flights. The CFM56 engine on Southwest flight 1380 blew apart over Pennsylvania on Tuesday, about 20 minutes after the Dallas-bound flight left New York’s LaGuardia Airport with 149 people on board.The explosion sent shrapnel ripping into the fuselage of the Boeing 737-700 plane and shattered a window. Jennifer Riordan, 43, a bank executive, was killed when she was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat in row 14 as the cabin suffered rapid decompression. Fellow passengers were able to pull her back inside but she died of her injuries later on Tuesday. On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt told a news conference the incident began when one of the engine’s 24 fan blades snapped off from its hub. Sumwalt said investigators found the blade had suffered metal fatigue at the site of the break. Sumwalt said he could not yet say if the incident, the first deadly airline accident in the US since 2009, pointed to a fleet-wide issue in the Boeing 737-700. “We want to very carefully understand what was the result of this problem, and as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I’m very concerned about this particular event,” he said. “To be able to extrapolate that to the entire fleet, I’m not willing to do that right now.”Southwest crews were inspecting similar engines – made by a partnership of France’s Safran and General Electric – the airline had in service, focusing on the 400 to 600 oldest, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. It was the second time that style of engine had failed on a Southwest jet in the past two years, prompting airlines around the world to step up inspections.An NTSB inspection crew was also combing over the Boeing 737-700 for signs of what caused the engine to explode. Sumwalt said the fan blade, after suffering metal fatigue where it attached to the engine hub, suffered a second fracture about halfway along its length. Pieces of the plane were found in rural Pennsylvania by investigators who tracked them on radar. The metal fatigue would not have been observable by looking at the engine from the outside, he said. The jet was traveling at 190 miles per hour when it made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International airport, according to Sumwalt, much faster than the typical 155-mile-per-hour touchdown.Passengers described scenes of panic as a piece of shrapnel from the engine shattered a plane window, almost sucking Riordan out. “The window had broken and the negative pressure had pulled her outside the plane partially,” Peggy Phillips, a registered nurse who was on the plane, told WFAA-TV in Dallas. “Two wonderful men ... they managed to get her back inside the plane, and we laid her down and we started CPR.” Riordan was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, the company said. Videos posted on social media showed passengers grabbing for oxygen masks and screaming as the plane, piloted by 56-year-old Tammie Jo Shults, a former US navy fighter pilot, prepared for the descent. “All I could think of in that moment was, I need to communicate with my loved ones,” passenger Marty Martinez told ABC’s Good Morning America on Wednesday. During the incident, he logged on to the in-flight Wi-Fi to send messages to his family. “I thought, these are my last few moments on Earth and I want people to know what happened,” said Martinez, who live-streamed images of passengers in oxygen masks as the plane made a bumpy descent. The airline expected to wrap up its inspection of the engines it was targeting in about 30 days. The GE-Safran partnership that built the engine said it was sending about 40 technicians to help with inspections. The investigation could take 12 to 15 months to complete. In August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. That incident prompted the FAA to propose last year that similar fan blades undergo ultrasonic inspections and be replaced if they failed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8bcf1d8cd46bc87b234e25bf5e79366c5a4373b/36_248_3670_2202/master/3670.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0bc76b1490ab8e1234260e9bffb50437 1240w","title":"taste the difference farm to fork movement takes off in urban flanders","story":"The densely populated area of Belgium is seeing a mini-boom in model of farming where growers sell direct to consumers Flanders, famed for its medieval cities and motorways that can be seen from space, is one of the most urban corners of Europe. Yet this densely populated area is seeing a mini-boom in a new type of agriculture where farmers sell direct to consumers.The movement, known as community-supported agriculture, is the antithesis of the sprawling global distribution chains of modern industrial food production. CSA farming means no supermarkets, no fertilisers and no monoculture.Advocates say the most important feature is the direct link to consumers, who pay upfront and often pick the produce from the fields.This model of farming – sometimes referred to as farm-to-fork – originated in the United States and the Netherlands, but has quickly taken off in the Belgian region of Flanders. More people are eating CSA-grown food in Belgium than in the more populous UK, according to a 2016 report by Urgenci, the international CSA network.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.comSince the first Flemish CSA farmer struck his spade into the soil in 2007, at least 45 similar businesses have sprung up in the region.Koen Tierens, a plant biologist, is one of the newest on the scene.

He has a 1.2-hectare (2.96-acre) plot in the village of Kampenhout just outside Brussels, where the rich, loamy soil is ideal for growing.Tierens’ father, a retired farmer, was sceptical when he outlined his plans a small holding, no fertilisers and a few old-fashioned, second-hand tools: “My father told me, ‘Koen what are you doing? You studied at university, you have a PhD! Are you going to be an ancient Belgian farmer doing how they did it in the middle ages?’”He grows 200 varieties of vegetable in a year – a much wider range than typical farmers. As well as the more common peas, carrots and potatoes, he grows less familiar varieties – purple cauliflowers, green zebra tomatoes, black radish, salsify and cardoon. But Tierens does not grow Belgian ene, the most emblematic vegetable in the national cuisine. Although he farms in a region that is famed for the bitter white lettuce, he decided it would be arrogant to grow his fellow farmers’ best-known crop.Another big difference with conventional farming is the limited use of subsidies, although he received EU funds to start his business and cover the costs of gaining organic certification.Other things are constant – the unpredictability of the weather and early starts. Tierens works in his field every day, wearing a head torch on dark winter mornings. During the peak growing season from May to October, he works 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a week. His customers share the risk of a storm or a bad harvest. “It would be a disaster for them as well, but the chance of that happening is not that big because I grow 200 types of vegetables,” he says.Belgium is an enthusiastic latecomer to CSA farming, which traces its roots to the biodynamic movement launched in the US in the 1980s. But there were other inspirations. The first known CSA farm in Europe was Les Jardins de Cocagne, an organic vegetable cooperative near Geneva founded in 1978. Japanese farmers were experimenting with similar models at around the same time. “It is not only about the food, it is also about the community and being outside,” says Nele Lauwers, a policy adviser at the Flemish farming union Boerenbond. She belongs to a CSA cooperative near Ghent and describes harvesting days as “a weekly outdoor trip” for her children.Demand for pick-your-own vegetables is growing among medium to high earners, she says. But price may limit its appeal. “It’s quite a different market. You have to pay in advance and it is not possible for everybody, although some CSA groups may offer social prices.”The Flemish government has agreed a ban on new urban development from 2040 unless an equivalent area of land is returned to nature.Another feature of CSA produce is that it takes longer to prepare. Vegetables arrive in customers’ kitchens with earth clinging to roots and leaves, rather than shiny and neat in plastic packaging. “Not everyone likes to bring soil into their kitchen,” says Tierens. “With me you need to invest a little bit more time, but you can taste the difference.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Winter took its time to disappear we seem to have skipped straight to summer. For a little while, at least. By early afternoon on Thursday temperatures were already hitting 18 degrees with a high of 19 degrees expected. The forecast looks good for the weekend too with the forecaster predicting that it will be very mild for the next couple of days although it will become cooler from Sunday, with more unsettled conditions next week. The good weather is thanks to a ridge of high pressure from the Continent replacing the cold air which has been dominant since the cold snap of early March. It will not be anything like as hot as the United Kingdom. London was expected to reach a sweltering 26 degrees on Thursday. Earlier in the month there was snow in the same city. The NHS in the UK has even issued warnings about going out in the midday and staying hydrated.Met Éireann director Eoin Moran said the sudden stratospheric warning which brought the unprecedented snow in March and the prolonged recent cold spell is now at end. The current of wind above the North Pole which brings us our normal winter weather, was disturbed and the jet stream drifted southwards bringing in cold air from the north. It led to one of the coldest March in some parts of the country in 50 years and “It was an extreme weather event,” he said. “These events have happened in the past. The weather has a natural set of extremes and a natural variation and this is within normal variation.” Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?The Crossword Club provides access to an archive of more than 6,000 interactive crosswords from The Irish Times.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe European Union might integrate more smoothly after Brexit, once it no longer has a “permanently reluctant member in the room”, the former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day has said.Speaking at Newman University Church in Dublin, where she gave the Barrett Family Lecture 2018, Ms Day said that she saw “no room to hope” the UK would change its mind about leaving the European Union. But she also said that she saw no “domino effect” and that Europe would continue to enlarge, taking in countries in the Balkans “one or two at a time”.In the absence of the UK, she predicted in Will the EU Survive Brexit?, the “euro and Europe” would become synonymous, with smaller states that had resisted the single currency now being “pushed” into joining it. She also said that security and defence were “an area where Europe would have to step up to the plate”. Although most states would remain in Nato, “economies of scale” in European defence forces could deliver similar “boots and helicopters”.Ms Day told the audience, many of whom were students of the Nanovic Institute for European Studies at the University of Notre Dame, the steward of the church, that Brexit could ultimately be good for relations between Britain and Ireland, as Britain seeks an external relationship with the EU. “It is just that we need a bit more enlightenment in certain parts of London for that to happen.”She said in many ways the EU had not played fair with Turkey, keeping it “dangling” for 40 years. But she added that there were many things to consider, including that Turkey would become the unions’s largest member state on entry and that some countries would raise the issue of Christian and Muslim differences. Of the future of the EU, she said, “It may not last 1,000 years, but it will be here for a long time to come.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3464557.1523975813!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"he was a lifeline for a dispossessed people big tom remembered","story":"Irish country singer Big Tom McBride has died aged 81, in 2017 he released a duet with Margo O\u0027Donnell called A Love That\u0027s Lasted Through The Years. Video: Margo O\u0027Donnell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBig Tom at the funeral of Irish country singer Larry Cunningham in Co. Longford in 2012. Photographer: Dara Mac DónaillTHE IRISH TIMES Nobody could fill a hall at the height of the showband era like the late Big Tom McBride. Long queues would form outside the local ballroom when Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, came to town. Generally, dancing was 9pm to 1am, with a relief band getting proceedings underway.In the 1960s, as Ireland was slowly changing, the ballrooms replaced as dance venues the parish halls, which had been frequently run by the local parish priest, whose task sometimes was to guard against the perils of close dancing.Not so the ballrooms, where close dancing ceased to be a moral threat.Many of the ballrooms were exotic, by comparison, and they introduced an element of glamour in a grey Ireland. Their opening saw the emergence of the showbands, vocally more sophisticated than the parish hall band, with the singers and musicians sporting bright suits and modern hairstyles. Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, became the country stars of that new world. When he recorded the sentimental Gentle Mother in 1967, it became an instant hit, reaching the coveted number one spot in RTÉ Radio’s top 10 records.An overnight success, he went on to enjoy a huge following at home and among Irish emigrants.Yet the showband business was run on an informal basis, with mainly cash transactions.In the midlands, a young businessman, Albert Reynolds, later to become Taoiseach, opened a series of ballrooms. He was later spoken of as a good promoter the band was always paid and a hot meal provided before going on stage. In Tralee, Co Kerry, a ballroom attached to the Mount Brandon hotel, opened by then Taoiseach Sean Lemass in the 1960s, was a hugely successful venue for Big Tom. It had a chandelier and a large balcony. Like the other ballrooms, though, it sold nothing stronger than soft drinks.The women queued on one side of the hall and the men on the other. If there was a large crowd, there was a rush to ask a woman to dance. This was the entertainment world dominated by Big Tom, Dickie Rock, Brendan Bowyer, Brendan O’Brien and Philomena Begley in the sixties and seventies.With the exception perhaps of Bowyer, nobody rivalled Big Tom as a crowd-puller. His country audience followed him faithfully, sometimes driving miles to see him play, not least in the summer when the venue could be a marquee in a country village where the local carnival was being held. He understood his audience. He came from Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and knew rural Ireland. He had spent some time as an emigrant in London. His songs were about love affairs, many of them ending in remorse and melancholy, old Irish ballads, and some modern songs. Despite being the lead singer and playing the guitar in the band, he was intensely uneasy with fame.I interviewed him many years ago when he was playing at the Festival of Kerry at the height of his fame.He was a courteous, diffident, shy man. He told me he found public recognition difficult.He had just turned down his own series on RTÉ television at the time because the station wanted to use professional session musicians rather than his own band members, all of whom hailed from his native Monaghan.“They would be the best in the business,’’ he said. “But they would have no interest in country music.’’Big Tom and his music were lampooned, of course. In an Ireland struggling for sophistication, having watched too much television, Big Tom and his likes were not cool.His country fans dismissed the lampooning, followed him in the dancehalls and bought his records in abundanceIn recent times, he would get due recognition on a country music special on The Late Late Show, presented by Ryan Tubridy, who helped the visibly ailing Big Tom to the microphone to sing his trademark Four Country Roads. Some 400,00 people emigrated from Ireland between 1951 and 1961 alone, most of them poorly educated and ill-prepared. Many headed for British building sites and factories. “They were a silent generation,’’ the novelist John McGahern later wrote,”and they left in silence.’’They followed Big Tom when he came to London to play in the then thriving Irish dancehalls, such as the Galtymore in Cricklewood, the National in Kilburn, and the Gresham in Holloway Road. They played his records at home and sang his songs at Irish emigrant gatherings, the poignancy of his voice in harmony with the bitter-sweet experience of forced emigration.It is very easy today to dismiss all this as crass sentimentality. It would be wrong, because it was no such thing.Big Tom’s songs and music were a lifeline for a dispossessed people, forced out of their own country, which could not even provide them with the basic human right of a job. Many of those songs were melancholic. But our history of forced emigration is laced with melancholy.A good friend, John Mulrooney, from Sligo, was a close friend of Big Tom. Some years ago, we said we would meet up at one of his concerts. We never did.I regret that now.The Ireland which made Big Tom a country star is gone.

File photograph: CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has suggested the Decade of Centenaries should end in 2024 with events to mark the 75th anniversary of the Republic of Ireland.The State became the Republic of Ireland on April 18th, 1949. Prior to that the British monarch still signed letters of credence accrediting Irish ambassadors and Britain signed international treaties on Ireland’s behalf.The Republic of Ireland Act abolished the last vestiges of British rule in Ireland and established the State as a republic.Speaking at an event to mark the 69th anniversary on Wednesday night, Mr Varadkar said both the 70th anniversary next year and the 75th anniversary in 2024 should be marked as State occasions.He raised the possibility of a “Republic Day” every year, but he said it would need to be low key except on significant anniversaries as St Patrick’s Day and Easter Monday occur around the same time.Mr Varadkar suggested that the Decade of Centenaries which is due to end in 2023 would end with a “downbeat note” if it ended with commemorations to mark the Civil War.Instead, he proposed that marking the 75th anniversary of the Republic in 2024 would end it on an “upbeat and optimistic note”.He said he would raise the issue with the expert advisory group on the commemorations chaired by Dr Maurice Manning.Members of the Fine Gael party gathered at O’Connell House in Merrion Square, Dublin to mark the 69th anniversary and discuss ways to mark the forthcoming anniversaries of the Republic.Mr Varadkar told them that any celebrations to mark anniversaries relating to Ireland as a republic should not be Fine Gael-led events, but non-party political as the commemorations to mark the Easter Rising had been.He also stated that Fine Gael did not celebrate its own “really proud history”.He said Fine Gael had twice in his lifetime “rescued and rebuilt an economy that had been laid waste by others”.There had been five previous declarations of a republic in Irish history, but only one which was recognised by international governments – the one declared in 1949 by the Fine Gael Taoiseach John Costello, he said.Copies of The Irish Times from the day after the declaration of the Republic were circulated among members of the party. The paper recorded that there was widespread jubilation in the street after the State became the Republic of Ireland at midnight on April 18th, 1949.The Taoiseach added: “I believe we could organise a similar spectacular for midnight, the 18th of April 2024, and have music, entertainment and a light display for people of Ireland. And why limit it to only Dublin?“I believe we should have similar events in Cork, in Galway, and Limerick and Waterford, and events throughout the country if towns were interested in taking part.”Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said any celebration of a Republic had to consider the context of Northern Ireland.“The declaration of a republic means different things to different people. If we are going to have a national celebration of that, which we should have, we should consult quite widely.”Junior minister Patrick O’Donovan said a celebration of the Irish republic would “taken back what it means to be republican”. He said the established parties had surrendered the term republican to “ a very narrow set of people who do nothing to embrace the values of a republic, but instead seek to ide”.Fine Gael executive council chair Gerry O’Connell said there ought to be a “Republic Day” every year.He said Costello’s declaration of a Republic ended all ambiguity about the nature of the Irish State.He suggested the declaration of a republic in 1949 vindicated Michael Collins’s stance on the treaty that it gave Ireland “the freedom to achieve freedom”.The contention from Fianna Fáil that Fine Gael was somehow less Irish than they were could never be thrown at the party again, he added.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3466257.1524083928!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inm and the minister who said what to whom and when","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeslie Buckley: Mr Buckley, then INM chairman, texted Denis O’Brien on January 12th, 2017, after Minister for Communications Denis Naughten officially announced he was referring the takeover to the BAI. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Former Independent News \u0026amp Media chairman Leslie Buckley told the company’s biggest shareholder Denis O’Brien that the decision to refer the company’s proposed takeover of Celtic Media Group to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland after being cleared by the competition regulator was unprecedented.Mr Buckley, then INM chairman, texted Mr O’Brien on January 12th, 2017, after Minister for Communications Denis Naughten officially announced he was referring the takeover to the BAI, two months after they first learned of his intention through a private telephone conversation he had with an INM lobbyist.Explaining his account of the telephone call and referral, Mr Naughten told the Dáil yesterday he had expressed “a purely personal view” in conversation with the lobbyist Eoghan Ó Neachtain – on a phone call on either November 10th or 11th, 2016 – that his “likely course of action” would be to refer the takeover “in light of the scale of the proposed acquisition”. Mr Naughten said that there was “nothing wrong or inappropriate” with him saying to “anyone or to the public that if the plan for the merger continued I would take advice on sending it to the BAI”. Two months later, Mr Buckley thought the referral to the BAI was unusual.He told Mr O’Brien in the text message that the takeover was “cleared by the competition authority and normally on that basis the Minister would just sign”.“This is the first time that having been approved by the competition authority that it is referred to the BAI,” Mr Buckley added.Referring to BAI chief executive Michael O’Keeffe, Mr Buckley told Mr O’Brien he thought Mr O’Keeffe was “the type of guy that won’t be pushed around”.Director of Corporate Enforcement Ian Drennan has claimed Mr Buckley’s text was one of nine communications from Mr Buckley to Mr O’Brien in which he shared information that may be defined as “inside information” relating to a public company and, as a result, that he may have breached stock market rules. Legal papers filed by Mr Drennan in his bid to seek the appointment of High Court inspectors to INM reveal confidential contacts between various parties, including Mr Naughten, with interests in the merger. Mr Naughten made a lengthy statement to the Dáil in response to The Irish Times revealing yesterday that Mr Drennan raised significant concerns about communications, including Mr Buckley’s sharing the Minister’s plans for the takeover with Mr O’Brien from the Ó Neachtain telephone call. Mr Ó Neachtain told The Irish Times yesterday that he “did not disagree with a word that was said by the Minister” in the Dáil.The Minister told the Dáil that Mr Ó Neachtain, a former government press secretary, phoned him in advance of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) telling the Minister that it would not be blocking the deal.Mr Ó Neachtain told this newspaper this week that he was hired by INM to find out the Minister’s reaction to that decision and to see if he intended to refer the deal to the BAI. He stressed he was not lobbying for the Minister’S approval.Mr Drennan’s affidavit says Nigel Heneghan, managing director of the PR firm where Mr Ó Neachtain works, shared details of the November telephone call with the Minister in an email to Mr Buckley at 9.36am the next day.Mr Heneghan wrote that the Minister said that based on the advice of his officials he would refer the deal to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for review because of the level of cross-media ownership by Denis O’Brien, INM’s biggest shareholder.Mr Heneghan told Buckley the information was “highly confidential as the Minister has not been officially informed yet of the CCPC decision.” Mr Buckley forwarded the email to Mr O’Brien at 10.07am, the Drennan affidavit shows.Despite Mr Naughten flagging his likely plans to Mr Ó Neachtain, the Minister told The Irish Times in an interview 12 days later that he had not yet looked at the deal. He told the Dáil on December 6th, 2016, he had not yet made a decision. Mr Naughten told the Dáil yesterday the proposed merger reached him on November 21st, 2016, after the CCPC ruling and that his officials recommended on January 4th, 2017, that it be referred to the BAI. The referral was official approved by him on January 10th, 2017, and then announced.The BAI was given 80 days to examine if the takeover would damage media plurality in Ireland given it would have increased INM’s ownership of regional newspapers from 13 to 20.Asked if he had any other contact with INM staff, Mr Naughten told the Dáil that, in May 2017, he met Mr Buckley at an INM data conference at the RDS in Dublin. They engaged in small talk, he said. The following month, INM and Celtic called off their proposed merger, just before Mr Naughten was due to consider the BAI’s report.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3467096.1524141708!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"naughten expresses sincere regret over phone conversation on inm","story":"Minister for Communications Denis Naughten has denied that he misled the Dáil in his December 2016 statement on the purposed purchase of Celtic Media by INM.

Mr Naughten, in a statement to the Dáil on Wednesday, said he only offered a “personal view” to the lobbyist and today said he now regretted “expressing my opinion”.\u0026nbsp He said he “acted to the letter of the law” when he had a conversation with lobbyist Eoghan Ó Neachtain in November 2016 about the mooted takeover of Celtic Media by INM. He also insisted he had “no inside information” to give.The Irish Times reported on Wednesday details from court documents filed by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as part of a bid to have High Court inspectors appointed to INM. These referred to the Ó Neachtain conversation with Mr Naughten over whether the takeover would likely be referred to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI). This was allegedly relayed to Denis O’Brien two months before a decision was made.Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Naughten said he is “not responsible” for how Mr Ó Neachtain interpreted the information and transmitted it back to Independent News and Media.“First of all, I am in a very difficult position in that I am asked to comment on an alleged reference to me in an alleged affidavit,” Mr Naughten said. “We have all been cautioned by Mr Justice Peter Kelly. “The view that I gave Mr Ó Neachtain was based solely on information that was in the public domain at that stage. I did not have any information as minister at the point I spoke with Mr O’Neachtain in early November (2016). As I pointed out, he was the one who informed me that the competition and consumer protection commission had made a decision on this. “That was before the file actually came to me. When I spoke in the Dáil in early December the file had actually come to me. It was under active consideration and I told the Dáil in December that I was awaiting a report from my officials on that file and I would be making a decision based on that.“I also stated to Mr Ó Neachtain in the very brief conversation that I had with him that I would be deciding solely on the advice that I was given by my officials and I would be acting on that. “And I am not responsible for what way Mr Ó Neachtain interpreted that conversation or how he fed that back to his clients. “I also want to say I sincerely regret expressing my opinion on this at the time. I said nothing wrong. Anyone who knows me knows that I am very accessible as a minister to my constituents, to my colleagues on all sides of the House in Leinster House and to the media. “In fact my mobile phone number is on my website. I do sincerely regret expressing a view on it but I am absolutely clear that I said that I would abide by the recommendation of my officials and the files clearly show that I did that.“I would provide the offer to anybody to come and view the files for themselves.” Mr Varadkar is expected to come under pressure in relation to Mr Naughten’s Dáil statement. However, a spokesman for Mr Varadkar said on Wednesday the Taoiseach was satisfied with the explanation given by Mr Naughten to TDs. Last night at a Fine Gael event in Dublin the Taoiseach said Mr Naughten’s explanation was “clear”.Earlier, Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy insisted there was no “nod and wink” between Mr Naughten and Mr Ó Neachtain. “Denis did not give anyone a heads up on what he was going to do,” he said. “It was quite clear what he said to the person he was on the phone with, that he was going to do what his officials advised him to do. “If a lobbyist is then going to interpret that for their own reasons.. that is a totally separate thing. “But Denis did admit perhaps he shouldn’t have taken the phone call, but he did.“I think saying I’ll be guided by my officials and I’ll follow the law as and when the process begins , I don’t think that is gold information,” he told RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke. “Some people might try to sell that as gold, but I don’t think it is gold information. “There was no nod and wink, no one benefited from anything, because Denis had no information to give.”We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window   April 19, 2018With horrifying suddenness, an engine exploded and a passenger was partly sucked through a broken window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

The advantages are plain to see.\u0026quotThe CHOGM opening ceremony saw leaders move to pay tribute to the Queen’s service to the Commonwealth in a ceremony attended by 46 Commonwealth heads of government and seven foreign ministers representing their countries to make up 53 member states.The Queen delivers her speechDr Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of Malta and outgoing chair-in-office of the Commonwealth, said: \u0026quotWhen your father, His Majesty King George, started what he started, you have not only continued, but also elevated to unprecedented levels.\u0026quotWe are equally elated by the vigour with which His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs, and puts a strong Commonwealth dimension in his various national and global initiatives.\u0026quotWe are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0026quotA Guard of Honour for CHOGMTheresa May, the Prime Minister, received prolonged applause after addressing the Queen directly, saying: “This week you have opened your homes to us – here in London and in Windsor. Over many years you have been the Commonwealth’s most steadfast and fervent champion.“You have been true to the deepest values of the Commonwealth – that the voice of the smallest member country is worth precisely as much as that of the largest that the wealthiest and the most vulnerable stand shoulder to shoulder.“You have seen us through some of our most serious challenges. And we commit to sustaining this Commonwealth, which you have so carefully nurtured.Soldiers of the Coldstream Guards carry flags of the 53 Commonwealth countries at Buckingham Palace “For your service, for your dedication, for your constancy – we thank you.”The Prince of Wales, who walked into the ballroom at the side of the Queen and made the first address, said: “For my part, the Commonwealth has been a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember, beginning with my first visit to Malta when I was just five years old.“And so, Ladies and Gentlemen, I pray that this Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will not only revitalize the bonds between our countries, but will also give the Commonwealth a renewed relevance to all citizens, finding practical solutions to their problems and giving life to their aspirations.Theresa May delivers her speech at Buckingham Palace“By doing so, the Commonwealth can be a cornerstone for the lives of future generations, just as it has been for so many of us.” He raised a smile from Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, as he name-checked his father Pierre during a list of “giants of the Commonwealth” he has been “fortunate” enough to meet.The ceremony, hosted by broadcaster Reeta Chakrabarti, also saw guests treated to musical performances, with the Queen looking on intently.Emeli Sande gave a rendition of the national anthem, before a group of six “Commonwealth Voices” performed a version of Unwritten, a pop song now considered by organisers to be a “youth anthem”.The Queen and Prince of Wales arrive at the opening of CHOGM togetherYoung musicians played Shepherd’s Hey, a folk song, and two winners of the Queen’s Young Leaders programme, Devika Malik and Philip Cole, told their stories.While the Queen took her seat on stage with the heads of government and Secretary-General Baroness Scotland, the Prince of Wales watched with senior members of the Royal from a small audience.The formal opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the ballroom at Buckingham PalaceHe was joined by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and sons the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Also in attendance were the Duke of York, the Princess Royal, the Countess of Wessex, the Duke of Kent, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra, who walked out as a family at the end of the ceremony.Later today, the Queen and Prince of Wales will host a lunch at Buckingham Palace for new heads of government.This evening, the Royal Family, heads of government and their spouses, will reconvene at the palace for a formal “Queen’s Dinner”, with a drinks reception and a second speech from Her Majesty.Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM)Please review our commenting policyGirl killed herself weeks after police released stepfather accused of sexual abuse on bail, court hearsMeet Miguel Diaz-Canel, the first man to lead Cuba after the CastrosMiguel Díaz-Canel confirmed as Cuba\u0026#39s new presidentItaly closes net on mafia godfather in Sicily with dawn raids and arrestsPlastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds may be banned - so what should you use instead?Woman, 90, killed when van crashes through wall into her living roomShoreham air crash pilot appears in court for first time charged with manslaughter over 11 deathsApril mini heatwave 2018 - how long we can expect warm British weather to lastDonald Trump says he\u0026#39ll walk out of Kim Jong-un talks if they\u0026#39re not \u0026#39fruitful\u0026#39 London Marathon runners warned to ‘think carefully’ about wearing heavy costumes as race to be hottest in historyInside Panmunjom: The DMZ \u0026#39truce village\u0026#39 that will host historic talks between Kim Jong-un and South KoreaOn this day in 1012: Ælfheah, Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury, is murdered at a drunken feastDale Winton dies at 62: Tributes to Supermarket Sweep host - \u0026#39a generous soul with a touch of naughty\u0026#39Too hot to work?

It bases this scenario on the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech which outlined the Brexit she hopes to deliver.This would mean leaving the single market and customs union whilst maintaining access to EU markets with minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers. It would also include the flexibility to erge from Brussels regulations, negotiate trading relationships with other non-EU countries and implement restrictions on immigration.The research estimates that this outcome would leave the country better off than a no-deal Brexit but worse off than under the “Norway model” or under an average free-trade agreement such as the one Canada has with the EU.The Norway model, in which the UK would stay in the single market and adhere to EU rules and regulations but leave the customs union, would have a negative fiscal impact of £262m per week while the Canada option would cost around £877m per week, Mr Portes finds. The figures are the equivalent of  9 per cent and 31 per cent of the current NHS budget respectively. A no-deal Brexit in which the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms is estimated to cost £1.25bn per week. No scenario is more beneficial than staying in the EU.The analysis takes into account the benefits from lower financial contributions to the EU budget and a new trade deal with the US as well as costs arising from new customs controls, tariffs, and reduced migration. A survey conducted as part of the research found that 72 per cent of Leave voters thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for a bespoke Brexit deal, while 78 per cent said it was worse than they had hoped for when they cast their vote in June 2016.Among all EU referendum voters polled, just 23 per cent said they thought the estimated cost would be worth paying.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so we’d recommend doing this on a computer.Facebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts you’ve shared, your messages and photos, ads you’ve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site. It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.The company said that it will now give people the chance to opt into targeted marketing, and having their data collected for ads. If they don\u0027t want to do that, they will be able to turn some of the settings off, but the site has made very clear that will not apply to all of them.The EU law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect next month, promises the biggest shakeup in online privacy since the birth of the internet. Companies face fines if they collect or use personal information without permission.Facebook admits it tracks users around the internet for adsFacebook deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said the social network would begin seeking Europeans’ permission this week for a variety of ways Facebook uses their data, but he said that opting out of targeted marketing altogether would not be possible.“Facebook is an advertising-supported service,” Sherman said in a briefing with reporters at Facebook’s headquarters.Facebook users will be able to limit the kinds of data that advertisers use to target their pitches, he added, but “all ads on Facebook are targeted to some extent, and that’s true for offline advertising, as well”.Facebook, the world’s largest social media network, will use what are known as “permission screens” – pages filled with text that require pressing a button to advance – to notify and obtain approval.The screens will show up on the Facebook website and smartphone app in Europe this week and globally in the coming months, Sherman said.The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit “decline.” Instead, they will guide users to either “accept and continue” or “manage data setting,” according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday.“People can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,” Sherman said.Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs.Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to US congressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook’s commitment to privacy.Facebook chief financial officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the GDPR.Additional reporting by agenciesThe Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The situation is made more urgent by the fact that the UK cannot even begin to negotiate replacement deals with other countries until it has left the EU.“It has become clear that negotiating our trade framework after Brexit will be a complex and time-consuming matter,” the MEPs wrote in the letter.“As political representatives of farmers and food exporters we are deeply concerned that the underestimation of the difficulty of this process should not impact negatively on them and hence on British trade.Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP representing the strongly rural and agricultural South West, and one of the letter’s signatories, said: “Liam Fox’s infamous claim that securing a trade deal with the EU post Brexit would be the ‘easiest in human history’ has been exposed as total bluster and bravado. Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Improvements in popularity were from a very low base, and only a minority of switchers preferred a Corbyn premiership.”British Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street for the 1922 committee on June 12, 2017 in London, England.

More than a quarter (26 per cent) did not vote Labour in 2015, but switched their support shortly before polling day in 2017.A further 13 per cent did vote for the party in 2015, then said at the start of the 2017 campaign they would not do so again – but ultimately changed their minds during the six-week period.The average age of these late switchers was 45, compared to an average of 36 among people who had already decided by the start of the campaign to switch their support to Mr Corbyn’s party.Policy Network said that, to be in with a chance of winning a majority at the next election, Labour needs to hold on to the late switchers while also winning back the support of those who voted for the party in 2015, but not in 2017.This group also tends to be older, more opposed to immigration and less favourable to Mr Corbyn’s leadership than existing Labour voters.  Policy Network researcher Charlie Cadywould, who carried out the study, said: “Despite remarkable consistency in the polls since last June, politics remains as volatile as ever. That election showed conclusively that campaigns matter, with Labour’s fortunes turning in dramatic fashion.“Whenever the next one is called, whatever the polling at the time, neither party should go into it counting any chickens.“Our analysis shows that such a turnaround can come from any part of the electorate. Contrary to many assumptions, it wasn’t the young, passionate pro-Europeans or Corbyn-enthusiasts that drove Labour’s campaign comeback.”“To win next time around, the party will need to focus on winning back those it has lost since 2015, as well as those that have not recently – or ever – voted Labour.”He added: “Whatever happens to Labour or the Conservatives over the next four years could be wiped out overnight. We saw in 2017 what an impact a botched manifesto launch, a gaffe or an unforeseen event can have on a campaign.“The 2017 experience should warn all party leaders of the danger of hubris.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Over many years you have been the\u0026nbspCommonwealth\u0027s most steadfast and fervent champion.You have been true to the deepest values of the\u0026nbspCommonwealth\u0026nbsp- that the voice of the smallest member country is worth precisely as much as that of the largest that the wealthiest and the most vulnerable stand shoulder to shoulder.You have seen us through some of our most serious challenges.

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Guy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

This year\u0027s transition is seen as a test of whether the Cuban Communist Party can continue its one-party rule in the absence of its more well-known leaders.Mr Diaz-Canel has served as vice president of the powerful Council of State since 2013, when he was appointed by party leadership and approved by the National Assembly. The general public knows little about the 57-year-old former engineer, who has granted no interviews to foreign news outlets.A man rides his modified bicycle past a vintage American car in HavanaA taxi sits parked by Ancon Beach waiting for returning bathers in TrinidadAfrocuban carnival group Los componedores de batea performing in the streets of La Habana ViejaPastel colours for an ice-cream place and a vintage American car in Cienfuegos after sunsetA man on the phone in a bookshop in Old Havana (Habana Vieja) selling books and displaying propaganda poster of the Cuban RevolutionStreet Musicians in Santiago De CubaA man works to repair his classic American car after it broke down along the Prado, a wide avenue that runs from Parque Central to the Malecon seafront highway, in HavanaMembers of the \u0027Ladies in White,\u0027 a group founded by the partners and relatives of jailed dissidents that regularly protests against the Cuban government, demonstrate on the streets of HavanaStreet vegetables vendor in HavanaThe sun setting through the palm trees and creates long shadows on the pool deck at this resort in Cuba VaraderoGeneral view of a street in HavanaA girls plays on a street in HavanaGirls walk past graffiti art along the Paseo de Marti, the wide boulevard that runs through the heart of the historic Old Havana neighborhood in HavanaA woman smokes her Havana cigarA man harvests tobacco leaves for drying at a tobacco drying house on a co-op plantation in Pinar del RioMen play chess on a street in HavanaLocals take part in a gay parade in HavanaScene of the Memories Paraiso Azul resort in Santa Maria KeyBeach on the Bay of Pigs, Zapata PeninsulaDivers swimming above coral reef in Caribbean SeaBut Mr Diaz-Canel is well-known to Communist Party leaders, having worked his way up the ranks for more than 30 years. He started as a member of the Young Communists\u0027 Union in 1987, and became the first party secretary in Villa Clara province by 1994. He has also served as Cuba\u0027s minister of education, and lead delegations to Russia, China, Japan, North Korea, and several South American countries.Mr Diaz-Canel was born after the Cuban Revolution – one year after Fidel Castro took office – but has shown no signs of abandoning his revolutionary predecessors\u0027 policies.I believe in continuity, he told reporters who asked about his vision for Cuba\u0027s future, according to CNN. I think there always will be continuity.Mr Diaz-Canel is expected take office after Mr Castro retires this week, after serving two successive five-year terms. Mr Castro took over from his brother, Fidel, when he resigned in 2008. The two brothers have ruled the country since the revolution in 1959.Rual Castro is remembered for opening up the Communist country up to slightly more private enterprise, and for restoring diplomatic relations with the US under President Barack Obama. He will continue to serve as president of the Communist Party – a powerful government role. He attended and applauded Mr Diaz-Canel\u0027s nomination on Wednesday.Cuban elections are a multi-pronged process that start with the election of municipal representatives and end with the selection of the president. Candidates for many roles – including the president and vice president – are selected by government bodies. The US, European Union, and others have criticised the election process as not fully democratic.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The whole descent took about 15 minutes.It was reported that the passenger who died, Jennifer Riordan, was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was reportedly on the way back from a New York business trip, where she had sent a tweet on Monday showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan with the caption: “Great business stay.” Her Facebook page shows she was married with two children.After the emergency landing ensured the survival of everyone else on board, Ms Shults was unofficially identified by passengers, rather than by Southwest Airlines.She is now being compared to Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the pilot who in 2009 successfully landed a stricken US Airways passenger jet on the Hudson River, and whose life saving feat was turned into a film starring Tom Hanks. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

We are leave the customs union and will establish a new and ambitions customs arrangement with the EU while forging new trade relationships with our partners around the world.\u0026rdquoPALord Kerr said businesses want a customs unionLord Kerr was the diplomat responsible for drawing up Article 50, the legal mechanism for Brexit.Opening the debate this afternoon, he insisted businesses want a customs union.He told peers his amendment was phrased in such a which would require the Government to negotiate for a customs union deal.The Government would then need to explain to Parliament what it had done to try and secure it.GETTY IMAGESThe House of Lords vote is likely to reignite the debate over the UK\u0026rsquos customs union membershipIt would then ultimately be up to the EU to decide whether it wants to accept the terms, he said.Those in favour of the amendment insisted it would benefit Britain.Crossbench peer Lord Bilimoria said the change was needed to limit the damage caused by Brexit by keeping the UK in a customs union.Labour\u0027s Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town said the change was good for the governance of this country and would save the economy \u0026pound24billion over the next 15 years.What\u0027s the purpose of the House of Lords? How do you become a Lord? What are the House of Lords traditions? All these answers explained.1 of 25But UKIP Deputy Leader, Mike Hookem MEP lashed out at the House of Lords, branding the upper house of Parliament an an unelected nest of vipers who seem determined to reverse the EU referendum result\u0026rdquo.He said: Keeping the UK in the Customs Union is an absolute betrayal of Brexit, and the Lords know this.Under the proposals, the UK would have to continue to pay millions each week into the EU continue with open borders for EU citizens continue to implement EU law, and, most worryingly, join the developing EU army framework known as PESCO.I am in no doubt that the vast majority of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU will be absolutely disgusted by the subversion of our democracy in the Lords today.
