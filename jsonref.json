Brazil\u0027s government called the session an \u0027affront to democracy,\u0027 while the top-ranking U.S. diplomat in Latin America called Sunday\u0027s events in the chamber a \u0027farce.\u0027\u0027This morning´s phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum. There was no vote,\u0027 Assistant Secretary of State Michael Kozak said on Twitter.       National Assembly President Juan Guaido, Venezuela\u0027s opposition leader, tries to climb the fence past National Guards to enter the compound of the Assembly, after he and other opposition lawmakers were blocked Guaidó said lawmakers would gather later Sunday at the headquarters of El Nacional - the country\u0027s last major opposition newspaper - where they are expected to ratify their support for him.Guaidó faced a major test in uniting articulating a new vision Sunday in his year-long campaign to remove Maduro. But his re-election for a second straight year as head of congress - the source of his legitimacy in the eyes of many in the world - had been widely expected.The weeks leading up to Sunday\u0027s vote were marked by tension, with the opposition denouncing a covert government campaign to intimidate and bribe lawmakers into voting against Guaidó.Parra is one of a small handful of lawmakers who recently broke with Guaidó and have since been expelled from their parties for alleged involvement in a corruption scandal involving allies of Maduro.Socialist lawmakers argued that Guaido\u0027s absence forced them to initiate their session without him. But all day, opposition lawmakers faced resistance by security forces who set up several barricades downtown.       National Assembly President Juan Guaido, Venezuela\u0027s opposition leader, argues with police as he and other lawmakers are stopped a few blocks from the Assembly At one checkpoint, security forces demanded that each lawmaker present their credentials, arguing they were under orders to deny entry to several lawmakers banned from carrying out their duties by the loyalist supreme court.\u0027Is your family in Venezuela?\u0027 Guaidó asked the young police officers, who stood firmly in silence.\u0027Today you´re complicit with the dictatorship, you´re complicit with those who are responsible for the hunger inside Venezuela,\u0027 he added.Support for Guaidó inside the opposition has taken a hit after several minority parties in November splintered off to create a separate bloc to negotiate directly with Maduro - something that Guaidó has refused, arguing that talks are simply a time-buying exercise aimed at keeping Maduro in power.The small group of opposition lawmakers who broke with Guaidó argue that in stubbornly sticking to a naive plan of removing Maduro by force, he has put his political ambitions above the needs of Venezuelans who have largely tuned out from the political fight while enduring an economy in shambles and under stiff U.S. sanctions.       Pro-government lawmakers hold up their fists and shout that Chavez lives, referring to late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez\u0027In 2019 you represented the hopes of the nation, but today you\u0027re its biggest deception,\u0027 said José Brito, one of the lawmakers who turned against Guaidó amid accusations they used their position to enrich themselves and do the bidding of Maduro.Guaidó declared presidential powers over Venezuela on January 23, 2019, saying Maduro\u0027s reelection was illegitimate because the most popular opposition parties and political leaders had been disqualified from running.Venezuela sits atop vast oil and mineral resources, but it has been imploding economically and socially in recent years. Critics blame the plunge on years of failed socialist rule and corruption, while Maduro\u0027s allies say U.S. sanctions are taking a toll on the economy. The South American nation\u0027s 30 million people suffer soaring inflation and shortages of gasoline, running water and electricity, among basic services.       Lawmaker José Brito speaks to the press outside the National Assembly. Brito is a critic of Guaido       The opposition-controlled National Assembly is expected to decide whether to keep Guaidó as its leader for a second year in a special session        Guaido later opened a parliamentary session on Sunday at the offices of the El Nacional newspaper after being denied entry to the National Assembly An estimated 4.5 million Venezuelans have abandoned their nation in an exodus rivaling war-torn Syria.Maduro, who took over after the 2013 death of former President Hugo Chávez, says Guaidó is a puppet of the United States. Maduro also says he\u0027s determined to win control of the National Assembly in elections later this year.\u0027Despite perversions of the imperialist United States against Venezuela during 2019, we´ve managed to hold onto our independence, peace and stability,\u0027 Maduro tweeted recently.The two men remain locked in a power struggle. However, Maduro maintains military backing and control over most branches of the government, despite the deepening crisis and hard-hitting financial sanctions from the United States.\u0027Guaidó will have to not only re-energize his base and convince them to stay engaged, but keep his coalition in line as well,\u0027 said Geoff Ramsey, a researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u0027And the clock is ticking.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Tory MP branded CHILDISH wearing T shirt predecessors face it","story":"Share this articleAngry ex-Labour MP blasts his Tory successor for wearing T-shirt mocking him ¿ The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Vandals SAW legs Zlatan Ibrahimovic statue Swedish hometown Malmo","story":"Share this article   Malmo deputy mayor Frida Trollmyr said: \u0027I can understand that many people are disappointed in Zlatan\u0027s behaviour but vandalising a statute is simply unworthy.\u0027Better to express your dissatisfaction in a democratic way.\u0027But she added a citizens\u0027 initiative to move the sculpture will be considered in February.

Ask yourself: \u0027What do I need?\u0027 and \u0027What can I lose?\u0027You don\u0027t have a monopoly on ideasWhat gets cadets through Sandhurst\u0027s 44-week course is teamwork and mutual support. There is a lot of marching in formation, which teaches cohesion, discipline and attention to detail. But it also involves teamwork, because if a single person messes up their footwork, salute or shouldering of arms, it throws everyone else off their game.The British Army is made up of teams within teams, in which every person has a role. A tank cannot move without a driver nor can it fire without a gunner and it can\u0027t do any of those things without a commander.         This is the Sandhurst Way, and if I had to distil it down to one piece of advice, it would be: Stand Up StraightLoyalty — earned through professionalism, humility, decency and integrity — is the glue that binds iniduals into teams. An excellent team is one that feels good about itself and believes in its mission, and in its ability to succeed.In my experience, honesty is the most important aspect of leadership. The people you work alongside need to believe in you if they are to go the extra mile. But trust works best when it flows both ways, and the art of a great leader lies in listening to others, consulting with them, deciding on the best course of action and then leading the way forward.If, in your work, you find yourself managing a team of people, my advice is to create a culture where everyone feels confident enough to share their own ideas. Be flexible enough to listen to others\u0027 suggestions — after all, you don\u0027t have a monopoly on ideas.Go back to go forward When our cadets are high up in the Brecon Beacons in Wales on a mountain exercise, in freezing weather and blanketed in fog, one rocky outcrop starts to look like very much like all the others. Before they know it, they have become hopelessly disoriented.Admitting you are lost is not always easy, especially if you have a whole platoon of soldiers following you. It takes courage.But it\u0027s when we lose sight of our path and our sense of direction that we can take measure of ourselves, for better or worse, both as leaders and as people.The lesson here is not to panic when you lose your way. Take a second and breathe. Remember that getting lost is sometimes part of the journey to finding your way to where you want to be.Take a look at your surroundings and try to find a waypoint — the last time you felt you knew where you were. Then head back there. From this safe spot you can now reset yourself and start planning where you want to go, clearly mapping your destination.Take a \u0027Condor Moment\u0027Under pressure, it\u0027s imperative not to let your blood rule your brain. Instead of rushing in, stand back, take stock of the situation, reset, recalibrate. This is what we call a \u0027Condor Moment\u0027.The term originates from a 1980s series of commercials for Condor tobacco, where a pipe smoker deftly deals with anyone ruining the peace of his meditative smoke. For us, it signifies the presence of mind to take a moment to consider your options and plan your next step. In a crisis, stepping back from the situation, taking a breath and letting the adrenaline dissipate is vital.As a leader, backing yourself is crucial when you\u0027re under pressure. It\u0027s your job to invigorate your team with certitude, confidence and to give them hope, assuring them they are the best people to overcome the challenge and that you believe in them.By staying calm, others will be calmed too. Likewise, a display of panic will be reflected back in the behaviour of your team. So when you\u0027re confronted by the unexpected or the unfamiliar, give yourself a second and let your mind catch up instead of rushing head-first into it. Give yourself the space to think and you will find the solution.Lead from the frontThe Sandhurst motto is \u0027Serve to Lead\u0027. Cadets are taught to ensure the needs of their troops are served before they think about their own to always eat last and to lead from the front. This kind of selflessness is at the core of what makes a fine officer.And it works. As one alumnus told me: \u0027Sandhurst gives cadets a chance to really discover their strengths and weaknesses. You learn that you can never stop improving yourself and no goal is too big for you.\u0027We all have it in us to be heroic every day, to be less focused on ourselves and more aware of others\u0027 needs. So, keep a clear and uncluttered mind, sleep deeply, train hard and take care of yourself, inside and out.Above all, stand up straight and make your best nature second nature.Adapted from Stand Up Straight: 10 Life Lessons From The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst by Major General Paul Nanson, published by Century at £12.99. © Crown Copyright 2019.

The evolution of drone technology allows new ways of seeing, not possible even from the most manoeuvrable helicopter. The German photographer Tom Hegen has been a pioneer of such opportunities. Shooting directly downwards from a hovering near-stationary drone, he can flatten out perspective to the point that the Earth’s surface seems like a stretched canvas. His images of salt production landscapes in southern Europe give the sense that Google Earth has been hacked by abstract expressionist painters.This picture was taken above the pink lakes and white mountains of the salt industry at Aigues-Mortes near Montpellier in the south of France. Salt has been processed continuously from the marshes here since Roman times. To create table salt, seawater is channelled through 45 miles (70km) of intricate canals or roubines. The area is now restricted to visitors because of its unique ecosystem.Hegen says he was drawn to photograph here partly to document the brutal recasting of the landscape by centuries of human activity, and partly to capture the glorious geometries and colour contrasts. His picture is included in a new book, From Above: The Story of Aerial Photography. “I draw my inspiration from classic painters like Mark Rothko,” Hegen says. “I see all human beings as designers of our planet. And I see myself as a sort of framer, framing the artworks of the earth’s surface with my camera.”From Above: The Story of Aerial Photography by Eamonn McCabe and Gemma Padley is published by Laurence King (£40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ca60dea33303108dd5c939ae835f53f6c1a421/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d86b5880675bfcfeda780b5eff6471b","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The drone strike in Baghdad, bushfires in Australia, the continuing unrest in Hong Kong and New Year celebrations – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949976fc53b187fa154ae48315a8366f02ff5068/0_722_9294_5577/master/9294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1177a5ce83fecad5bc3b615da5dbf3","title":"original observer photography","story":"Stormzy, Robert Pattinson, fashion and clowns – the best photography commissioned by the Observer in December 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b320210c8b0d5b8a2eb5aaedb32f14dec366ad6/0_409_5904_3543/master/5904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad76b37c68ab5e48b200dd4c4ffa51ae","title":"the playful modernism of designer george him in pictures","story":"Jerzy Himmelfarb was an acclaimed graphic designer in his native Poland and later Germany before changing his name to George Him and moving to London in 1937, where he stayed throughout the second world war. “He was influential as an advocate for the value of graphic design as a creative practice and a way to connect with people, says Olivia Ahmad, curator of a new exhibition of Him’s wartime propaganda posters, packaging design and children’s illustrations.

Who is she, this dynamic demon of a little girl? Well, you could say that she is to American readers what Minnie the Minx is to those of us who grew up with the Beano. Like Minnie, she is smart, frequently badly behaved and not much given to following the rules like Minnie, she is a kind of feminist icon, albeit one who wears a neat red dress and whose hair hangs in old-fashioned ringlets.Little Lulu can outmanoeuvre any boy, reduce any adult to gobsmacked silence. No wonder, then, that her fans include not only Patti Smith and the poet Eileen Myles, but also Margaret Atwood, who has written the introduction to Little Lulu: Working Girl. (“The eternal problem of the boys’ clubhouse – not being let into it, that is – was treated by Little Lulu, by and large, with a phnuh.”)Little Lulu, AKA Lulu Moppet, was the creation of Marjorie Henderson Buell, better known as Marge she made her first appearance in a newspaper in 1935. When Marge stopped working on the strip in 1947, she was replaced by John Stanley, a journeyman comics writer much admired by his peers for his singular wit he would draw her for the next 14 years and it’s his surreal and subversive stories that are collected here.Those who like to think of the 50s as a time when women and children were seen rather than heard are in for a surprise in the case of the pugnacious and endlessly resourceful Lulu, whose voice is almost permanently raised and whose raison d’etre is basically to show the boys that girls are just as good as they are. When she falls out with her best friend, Tubby, it’s always he who ends up eating humble pie. When Alvin, the bratty six-year-old she is sometimes required to babysit, has one of his temper tantrums, only Lulu can shut him up, a silence she wins by telling him elaborate stories (Lulu’s way with narrative is one of the things that drew the young Atwood to her).With her pithy put-downs and her easy way with half-truths, it’s impossible not to warm to Little Lulu, though I like Tubby as well, a boy who will stop at almost nothing in order to bag himself a second dinner. There’s something intensely pleasurable, too, in the way that Stanley uses phonetic spellings and mangled pronunciations for comic effect (“Dear diry, I felt terrible bad in my stummik”) at moments, it made me think of Molesworth.Most of all, though, I like the yawning gap that exists between children and adults in these strips: they’re pro-child in the best sense, always pitting the open, curious minds of small people against the jaded, rigid outlook of those adults who try (and fail) to marshal them. If you like Charles Schulz and Roald Dahl – and really, who doesn’t? – then this gorgeously produced and very funny book is for you.• Little Lulu: Working Girl by John Stanley is published by Drawn \u0026amp Quarterly (£18.99).

Susannah Cahalan’s first book, Brain on Fire, described her first-hand experience of how catastrophically wayward such diagnosis can be.Cahalan was working as a reporter at the New York Post in 2009 when, aged 24, she developed what appeared to be a kind of paranoid schizophrenia. She believed bedbugs were invading her apartment, that her father had tried to abduct and kill his second wife, she heard voices, spoke gibberish, was unable to sleep and descended into catatonia. It was only the persistence of her parents, and an extra series of tests, that discovered an extremely rare autoimmune disease that was attacking her brain. The diagnosis saved her from the psychiatric ward, where, left unchecked, her illness would have left her cognitive functions irreparably damaged.That survivor’s story led her into the history of mental illness and its treatment and, inevitably, to one of the most infamous of experiments, the 1973 study On Being Sane in Unsane Places, conducted by a Stanford psychologist, David Rosenhan. The study, published not long before the release of the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, involved a series of eight healthy patients presenting themselves at mental hospitals with made-up symptoms. In each case, in Rosenhan’s account, the patients fooled the psychiatrists and were admitted to secure wards. The publication of these findings caused a huge stir in the world of psychiatry, as claims of objective certainty in diagnosis were apparently exposed as a sham, and subsequent treatment haphazard and invalid.Given her own experiences, and her twitchy investigative reporter’s nose, Cahalan was drawn to re-examine the case and its repercussions in the practice of psychiatry. The result of that inquiry is this compulsively readable book, in which she tries to track down the eight anonymous “pseudopatients” and examine the facts of their hospitalisation. Rosenhan died in 2012, the obituaries noting his famed experiment with access to his original field notes, Cahalan was able to piece together the untold stories of his research and test them against reality.She found only two of the eight pretend psychotics – as well as confirming that Rosenhan himself was one of them. Her efforts are so indefatigable that you are inclined to believe her hunch that the other five case histories may well have simply been made up. Even the detailed experience of those patients she was able to examine does not tally with Rosenhan’s claims. The evidence of one of them, Harry Lando, was excluded from the final report because he confessed a positive experience of the treatment. “HE LIKES IT,” Rosenhan noted, with incredulity.“Whenever the ratio of what is known to what needs to be known approaches zero,” Rosenhan once wrote, “we tend to invent ‘knowledge’ and assume that we understand more than we actually do. We seem unable to acknowledge that we simply don’t know.”The professor’s instincts were to suggest that we’d had enough of experts, but, if Cahalan’s investigation is correct, he apparently stopped short of applying that wisdom to his own scientific work.Cahalan, having unearthed these damning caveats, is not as damning as she might be. “Rosenhan’s paper,” she argues, “as exaggerated and even dishonest as it was, touched on truth as it danced around it.” That truth was the exposure of “the role of context in medicine”, the importance of diagnostic doubt as well as faith. Is it possible, as Chief Bromden observed in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, that Rosenhan’s findings represented “the truth even if it didn’t happen”? Cahalan is honest enough as a writer to leave that question hanging, having presented important and spirited cases both for the prosecution and the defence.• The Great Pretender by Susannah Cahalan is published by Canongate (£16.99).

Private firms have also baulked at joining the stock market, which is considered a route to broader investments from pension funds, international investors and inidual savers.According to data firm Dealogic, just 34 companies applied to be listed in the UK over the last year, the lowest number since 2009. The amount of money raised from new UK listings nearly halved compared with the year before to £3.7bn.The decline in new listings and rise in the number of existing stock market listed firms quitting to go private is expected to accelerate a decline in the proportion of publicly listed companies, not just in London, but in most major stock markets.Pinsent Masons blamed Brexit uncertainties for depressing the value of UK-listed firms compared to their European counterparts and making them more attractive to foreign buyers.The rise in deals may also reflect management teams being more receptive to partnering with PE funds to take a company private, said the law firm. Managers may believe that public markets undervalue their companies and are therefore open to offers from PE funds, though a majority of shareholders must agree to any takeover bid.Julian Stanier, a partner at the law firm said: “The speed at which companies are going private principally boils down to depressed share prices, low interest rates and the massive firepower of Private Equity.“Attractive valuations have enabled PE funds to acquire companies with strong fundamentals at prices below recent norms. We expect to see this activity continue into 2020. A new government with a strong majority has further added to the attractiveness of UK companies,” he said.Stanier said record-low interest rates in the UK and Europe made it cheaper to fund deals. Also, private equity funds were “sitting on large amounts of capital which they are under pressure to deploy”.He said: “This has resulted in PE funds considering a wider range of opportunities in order to put investors’ money to work, including acquiring listed companies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06163ba866337b1d5b8591e98ac4070c9ad1d16f/0_0_4132_2482/master/4132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20754218cde2f8c902edd5f21fe215e6","title":"aldi sales christmas stores","story":"Retailer says it sold 55m mince pies and 22m pigs in blankets in run-up to ChristmasChristmas sales at Aldi topped £1bn for the first time, as the German-owned discount supermarket continued its rapid expansion in the UK.Aldi aims to increase its UK chain from 874 stores to 1,200 by 2025.The growth has weighed on profits as it pours money into new stores and cutting prices to boost sales.

This is generally interpreted as also avoiding products that are cooked with meat.The marketing director of the fast-food chain, Katie Evans, described the product as a “game-changer”.“We wanted our first plant-based Whopper to replicate the indulgence and flame-grilled taste of the real thing as closely as possible, and we’re thrilled with the result,” she said. “We’re delighted to satisfy the demand for this highly-anticipated product and finally bring the Rebel to the UK.”The burger, made in conjunction with meat-free food company the Vegetarian Butcher, has tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles on a seeded bun, with a patty made from soy – a common meat substitute.Growing awareness of the impact of meat and dairy production on the climate has contributed to a spike in veganism in recent years, with the UN a long-standing advocate of reducing animal product consumption.Last year, 250,000 people pledged to go vegan in January, with vegan celebrities including Venus Williams, Zac Efron and Ariana Grande credited with raising the profile of the movement.The Rebel Whopper launch comes after Greggs’ debut of its vegan steak bake, a meat-substitute version of its popular pastry, in partnership with vegetarian food brand Quorn.The sandwich chain Subway has also made attempts to capitalise on a growing trend towards dairy, egg, and meat-free diets, adding a vegan marinara meatball sandwich to its offering , after launching a vegan patty in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf831b3475bbb379d0f7186d5fa0dc5bf25df87/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f86c6e4a9ec55b047eb5333176236246","title":"2010s legacy far right politics","story":"In just 10 years, far-right politicians, parties and ideas went from the fringe to the political mainstream - in countries across the worldThe past decade was the decade of the far right.In January 2010, leftist and centrist politicians led three of the largest democracies in the world: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Brazil), Manmohan Singh (India) and Barack Obama (US). In December 2019, all three countries have far-right leaders: Jair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. In Europe, center-left parties have been decimated, while mainstream right parties mainly survive by adopting frames and policies from the radical right. Only Germany still has the same center-right leader, Angela Merkel, but that will probably change in the next year, too.This political sea change is in large part the (delayed) consequence of demographic, economic and social shifts. After 911, the political debate in many countries shifted from socio-economic to socio-cultural issues. Even the Great Recession only changed this temporarily once the dust over the bailouts had settled, immigration and security quickly replaced austerity and economic inequality as defining issues once again.The decade started with a concerted attack on multiculturalism by mainstream-right leaders, including the former British prime minister, David Cameron, the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and even Merkel. But while they pandered to far-right voters, they largely refused to adopt far-right frames and policies. In 2011, for example, Cameron blamed “state multiculturalism” for failed integration and Jihadi terrorism, but, he argued, “instead of encouraging people to live apart, we need a clear sense of shared national identity, open to everyone”.This changed fundamentally with the so-called “refugee crisis” of 2015, which was a catalyst for the mainstreaming and normalization of the radical right. Immigration and security were now openly linked in the public mind. Mainstream and far right parties shot up in the polls, and radical right frames and policies were broadly shared by mainstream parties, from Austrian conservatives to Denmark’s Social Democrats.Even politicians who defeated radical right politicians with inclusive electoral campaigns would soon start adopting part of the radical right’s program. Hillary Clinton, who gained 2.5 million more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election, shamelessly argued that Europe should curb immigration to stop the far right, while Emmanuel Macron, who comprehensively defeated Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election, has played on anti-Islam sentiments, particularly in his foreign policy.And while the 2019 European elections were largely interpreted as a defeat of the far right, mostly based on exaggerated expectations – the far right actually scored its best result ever – the mainstreaming of far right frames had become so absolute that in September the president of the European Commission, the German Christian Democrat Ursula von der Leyen, proposed a controversial new title for the commissioner that includes immigration: “vice-president for protecting our European way of life.”Given the successes of rightwing populist parties and politicians in recent elections in Spain and the UK, one might think that the coming decade will see an even bigger electoral and political success for the far right, but I don’t think this will be the case. To be clear, the far right is here to stay, as is the mainstreaming and normalization of radical right ideas (and politicians) that characterizes what I have called the “fourth wave” of far-right politics. However, the far right has been punching politically well above its electoral weight in the past decade.The main reason for their disproportionate impact is the ideological weakness of liberal democratic parties. While defining themselves as the silent majority, the far right is in fact a shouting minority, which has faced little pushback from ideologically bankrupt mainstream left and parties. Forced by crushing electoral defeats, some center-left parties have started to develop new ideological programs, prioritizing economic inequality over economic growth, sometimes pandering to nativism (like in Denmark), sometimes not (like in UK and US).Mainstream rightwing parties have so far persisted, but their electoral success on the basis of radical right lite programs will not last forever. In the end, their only chance to sustain the electoral success is by transforming into full-fledged radical right parties, as we have seen in Hungary, Israel and the US. The only other way to survive is to re-establish conservative and Christian democratic programs that do not undermine the liberal democratic system and values.While still a minority, a growing number of right-wing politicians, including within the powerful European People’s party, are starting to understand that, rather than having played the far right, the far right has played then. To survive, they will have to re-establish their own ideological programs and put the defense of liberal democracy at the center of their political struggle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5ef6d7c7a250fe4dca95a4b7e301f880503faf/0_245_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02ff7b6bb48fbaacadbfe30e1855ae1e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pure’.Share your photos of what pure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 8 January at 10am.

Which is Velia? A doomster or a gloomster? We will of course see no more of this kind of thing in this year of optimism and unanimity. Likewise with Monk …… while the ‘Johnson’ in the clue might prompt the solver to consider Boris, plagiarism etc, the real meaning – AVIATRIX – is Amy, Gypsy Moth etc.And as usual, the year just gone is summarised in crossword form by Micawber in a typically droll puzzle.In the quiptic – the ’s puzzle for beginners and those in a hurry – Pan gives us a word with a curious history:In 1773, JWG de Brahm made a map of the Florida coast and decided to call one area River Glades this was apparently then misread, the swamps being named Ever Glade and then the Everglades ever since.A certain bodily function was, in Old English, known as fnesing. For those of us childish enough to enjoy wilfully misinterpreting old-school ſs as fs, it is an absolute treat to picture “fnese” being misprinted as “ſnese” and thereby becoming the word we use today. Reader, how would you clue SNEEZE?Today being epiphany, it is still technically not annoying to discuss Christmassy matters. So, a heads up for those who missed it about the classic Araucaria puzzle we have added to the archives, and a reminder that our last challenge was CHRISTINGLE.A fiddly entry to define, possibly, so I enjoyed such cryptic definitions as Zedible’s “Time for navel contemplation?” and Alberyalbery’s “Lighthearted pithy offering?”The audacity award, as we’ve seen, can be bestowed for many reasons. This time, it’s shared by the elaborate architecture of Komornik’s “The Light of the World, symbolically harmonious for all to see: no harm represented in Hunt’s religious icon” and the risk taken by Notgethithatonharry in “Head of Police in Chile accepts radical festive offering” of incurring the fury of Copeland and Summers.The runners-up are Porcia’s ecumenical “Festive Orange Order networking, on vacation with Irish Celt” and Catarella’s definition-borrowing “Most of the nice girls getting tanned bright orange” the winner is Lizard’s lovely all-in-one “What involves nice lights and bit of ribbon?”Kludos to Lizard please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics below. Also, I’m happy to reassure 10FootClaudicant both that the competitions are not a regular vehicle to crowdsource and plagiarise clues and that I know that this is not what he or she meant.While some of the best puzzles appear at the end of the year, it can be easy to miss them. Recommendations very welcome below. The clue below comes from Brendan’s puzzle of just before Christmas …… but is not a spoiler for the theme. Not directly, anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b9ecfc85b2a615cfb1b63c5a8f631dde4031e0/0_120_3475_2085/master/3475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c12a72a735c3c3adeb2fb65e8ee9364","title":"humpback whales bunny chow and golden beaches why you should visit durban","story":"Desperate for a dose of winter sun? South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

This is also how the UK and continental Europe accesses a lot of email, social media, online shopping, Netflix and other internet services. “Everything with the word smart in front of it has a data centre behind it,” said Ben Bryan, Digital Realty’s technical operations manager in Dublin.But there is a catch. The surge in Irish data processing will require significant new energy infrastructure and increase emissions, complicating Ireland’s response to the climate crisis. The cloud can create carbon: it is estimated that when the music video Despacito reached 5bn streamed YouTube views in 2018, the energy consumption was equivalent to powering 40,000 US homes a year (it has now exceeded 6.5bn views).It is already Europe’s data centre capital, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft siting operations there. Dozens of centres have opened in recent years, bringing the total to 54, with a combined power capacity of 642MW. Once a leading exporter of floppy discs and CD-Roms, Ireland has successfully transitioned to the big data era.It is just the beginning. With the state’s blessing another 10 centres are under construction, including a €1bn (£845m) Amazon hub in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, that together will add 202MW. Another 31 centres have planning permission, which would add 629MW. There has been one setback: planning approval delays prompted Apple to scrap a planned €850m (£743m) centre last year.“The data centre industry is growing so fast it’s hard to fathom,” said Patrick Bresnihan, a geography professor at Maynooth University in Ireland. “But somehow the tech companies get far less attention than aviation or fossil fuel companies.”Ireland faces a dilemma. The expanding web of data centres is part of a strategy to anchor tech companies that drive economic growth. They have been designated as “critical infrastructure”, facilitating planning approval. “Data centre presence in Ireland raises our visibility internationally as a technology-rich, innovative economy,” said a spokesperson for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DoBEI).But the boom will exact a price. Ireland is one of the EU’s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than €250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Missing later targets will trigger steeper fines.Ireland’s data centres have a low profile. They tend to operate from anonymous-looking business parks with high-security perimeter fences and intruder detection alarms. A Google centre has colourful murals but the rest are grey and nondescript, with discreet signage.Digital Realty, whose headquarters is in San Francisco, has a relatively small centre in Profile Park, part of a cluster in west Dublin. Its two data halls are powered by 9MW, a fraction of some neighbours but enough to require an electricity substation.It powers the servers and fans which during winter suck in cool air from outside. If the power – and cooling – stopped the machines would swiftly overheat, said Bryan. That has never happened but just in case there are backup diesel generators on the roof.Google and Amazon representatives also said their Irish data centres were energy efficient and entirely supplied by – or soon would be - renewable energy. Earlier this year Amazon Web Services announced backing for a 91.2MW windfarm in Donegal and a 23.2MW windfarm in Cork.Such deals could act as a catalyst for renewable energy investment, said the DoBEI, citing a 2018 government report.Asked about the estimated 1.5m tonnes of carbon emissions, it replied: “The department is not in a position to comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the estimates of the IAE study, which it is not a party to.”Bresnihan, the academic, said Ireland’s dependence on big tech companies should not obscure their environmental cost. “If they left Ireland would be in a pretty bad situation but there’s only so long you can put off these contradictions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c4174154230067551a22ec1dde4dcfce8235b41/0_148_4521_2713/master/4521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=983260f3126d5dfa0b400ce974c8522f","title":"london fashion week grace wales bonner 70s london reggae","story":"Designer who dressed Duchess of Sussex drew on classic designs and colours of Rastafarian flagLovers Rock, the reggae genre popular in London in the 70s and 80s, had an unexpected moment in the fashion spotlight on Sunday night at the capital’s menswear shows. Grace Wales Bonner, a much hyped designer who has dressed the Duchess of Sussex, dedicated her London fashion week collection to the music, and the scene that surrounded it over 40 years ago.Linley Hall, a grand building in equally grand SW1, was transformed into a homage to a youth centre. Guests including the artist Isaac Julien, the footballer Héctor Bellerín and poet Wilson Oryema sat at round tables, and fruit punch and Jamaican patties were offered as refreshments. In the show notes provided, Wales Bonner explained that she was inspired, in part, by John Goto’s photographs of second-generation British Caribbean and Asian young people at Lewisham youth centre for Lovers Rock parties. The soundtrack – put together by Jamie XX – was blasted out of speaker stacks, as it might have when these images were taken.The collection stuck close to the theme. It began with a crisp wool suit with a poloneck – a classically 70s combination, but with a minimalism that did away with any accusations of retro. Across women’s and menswear, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets followed, along with shirts printed with paintings by British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling.The red, gold and green of the Rastafarian flag were used on hats, vests and coats. All the clothes felt modern despite the references. This is one of Wales Bonner’s strengths. While her references are so academic that she provides a bibliography for each collection, she is able to translate her area of historical interest – be it Lovers Rock, Howard University in the 60s, or the court dress of Haile Selassie – into clothes that people want to wear.After the show, Wales Bonner – a somewhat serene presence in the usually frenetic world of a fashion show – explained that the inspiration for this show had been, as she put it, “inevitable” because of its proximity to her own background, and her Jamaican father’s experiences in London in the 70s. “I was thinking a lot about people coming into community centres and creating their own parties,” she said. “I was looking at John Goto’s Lovers Rock series and saw my family reflected in it.”Last year was a big one for Wales Bonner, starting with the curation of an exhibition at London’s Serpentine Gallery in January. She also won the BFCVogue Fashion Fund prize – an investment of £200,000 – in May. The designer’s pedigree is writ large in the company she keeps. The white coat-dress worn by the Duchess of Sussex to present her son in May was Wales Bonner’s, and she collaborated with Christian Dior’s Maria Grazia Chuiri on items for the megabrand’s cruise collection in April. She also partnered with Solange on a performance art happening, Devotional Sound, in New York.Wales Bonner highlights the work of other people of colour excelling in their field. Recent posts on her Instagram include a clip of poet London Kwesi Johnson reciting his piece Inglan is a Bitch in 1980, Bowling paintings, and a notice of a talk between Wales Bonner and artist Theaster Gates, for his show at the Tate Liverpool. Scroll further down and you’ll find musicians including Steve Lacy and Jorja Smith wearing her designs. It’s perhaps part of a wider vision for the designer’s label.“It is my ambition to build a brand that comes from a black cultural perspective and has the same authority, presence and impact as any esteemed European house,” she said to Vogue in May. “In the long term, I want Wales Bonner to exist on that same level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9563bb8e38b239590d2fb02fce182641bb2c354/0_338_5347_3210/master/5347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7e34b0e2557d464173e0a8bbdf5ba93","title":"the 2020 golden globes fashion on the red carpet in pictures","story":"Billy Porter, Jennifer Aniston, Cynthia Erivo, Jennifer Lopez and more flaunt big sleeves and long trains at the 77th edition of the film and television awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb31197c22a80f4812b4bd013b244a04a9a24103/0_45_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69e30fd4a1f579ca80de6a2e877d383b","title":"golden globes 2020 1917 and fleabag lead british invasion with major wins","story":"The first big awards show of the year saw British victories across the board, including for Olivia Colman, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Sam MendesIt was a night of stratospherically high star-wattage – Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Elton John, the list goes on – and big wins for British productions at the 77th Golden Globes, a night overstuffed with largely unsurprising awards, host Ricky Gervais’s apathy toward award shows, and calls to vote in 2020.Top of the British victory wave was 1917, Sam Mendes’s technically audacious film following two British soldiers in the first world war, which won for best picture – drama and best director. Best actor – drama, meanwhile, went to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker, who gave a rambling speech frequently obscured with network bleeps, and Renee Zellweger wining best actress in a drama for Judy. On the comedymusical side, the night tipped in favor of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and its supporting actor star Brad Pitt, as well as Brit Taron Egerton for his portrayal of Sir Elton John in Rocketman.It was also a night of historic firsts with The Farewell star Awkwafina becoming the first Asian-American woman to win for best actress in a musical or comedy (“If I fall on hard times, I can sell this,” joked the first-time Golden Globes attendee) and composer Hildur Guðnadóttir winning best score for Joker, becoming the first woman to win solo in the category.On the television side, the Globes extended the Emmys’ British invasion with numerous wins for stars from across the pond – Phoebe Waller-Bridge continued her awards season roll with best actress and best comedy for Fleabag, Olivia Colman ruled again for her takeover of Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown, and Brian Cox triumphed as best actor in a drama for Succession, whose British creator Jesse Armstrong picked up a win for best drama series. Uncharacteristically for the Globes, the television wins largely tracked with critical acclaim or consensus besides wins for the much-lauded Fleabag and Succession, awards went to the well-reviewed Chernobyl and its star Stellan Skarsgaard for supporting actor in a limited series, and what could be seen as a “best new artist” award to Ramy Youssef for his role in Hulu’s small but mighty series Ramy.Blasting stars’ enthusiasm to work for massive streaming companies, Gervais told the crowd to not use their speeches “as a platform to make a political speech”, and instead “come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and God, and fuck off”.Several of the winners pointedly ignored Gervais’s advice the night’s two most rousing speeches belonged to veteran speech-givers Patricia Arquette and Michelle Williams. Arquette, accepting for a repeat win as best supporting actress in a limited series for The Act, urged viewers to look past the pomp toward real issues. “While I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world,” she said. “For our kids and their kids we have to vote in 2020 and we have to get – beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.”Williams, accepting for best actress in limited series for FosseVerdon, built on her memorable Emmys speech on giving space for women to do their best work with a moving call for women’s right to choose. “I’ve tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me, but one that I can stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over,” she said – choices not possible without her right, as a woman, to “choose when to have my children and with whom, when I felt supported and able to balance our lives, knowing, as all mothers know, the scales must and will tip towards our children”. She concluded by calling on women “18 to 118”, to vote in their self-interest, because “it’s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them – but don’t forget we are the largest voting body in this country. Let’s make it look more like us.”The night’s other most resonant speeches belonged to the evening’s two lifetime honorees: Ellen Degeneres, accepting the Carol Burnett award for achievement in television from Kate McKinnon, who described the impact the comedian’s coming out had on her as a young woman, and America’s great everyman, Tom Hanks, introduced for the Cecil B DeMille by Charlize Theron as, simply, a man who “makes the world a better place”.Phoenix also took a political, if slightly less coherent than Arquette and Williams, stance in his speech. “It’s really nice that so many people have sent their well wishes to Australia but we have to do more than that,” he said, referencing the country’s devastating bush fires. “I have not always been a virtuous man. So many of you in this room have given me so many opportunities to get it right … Together, hopefully we can be unified and make some changes,” such as, he added, not taking a private jet to Palm Springs.The climate change-fueled disaster in Australia received much attention throughout the night best supporting actor in a limited series Russell Crowe wasn’t in attendance due to the fires, sending word instead to take climate action seriously, while Aussie native Cate Blanchett thanked well-wishers and urged for donations to first responders and those affected by the raging bushfires, because “when one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster”.Even Gervais had to agree, ending the night with a call to “get drunk, take your drugs, and also: donate to Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488366c6340eee4886977be75cbec5e90444265a/0_124_3672_2203/master/3672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35c36d959b4cde2cb95d9212acb71704","title":"harvey weinstein trial new york metoo movement","story":"The trial, which begins 6 January, will include testimony from two alleged victims and Annabella Sciorra amid concerns he may not be ultimately held legally accountableHarvey Weinstein is set to face his toughest legal challenge yet – a criminal trial for rape and sexual assault that could send him to prison for the rest of his life.Only a handful of women will be allowed to testify at the trial in New York supreme court in Manhattan, which begins on 6 January. But watching from the sidelines will be scores of women who have alleged sexual misconduct and abuse at the hands of Weinstein.In the New York trial, the 67-year-old movie producer is accused of raping a longtime lover, who has not been publicly named, in 2013, and of forcibly performing oral sex on his production assistant in 2006. The trial will include testimony from these two alleged victims, as well as from Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her at her apartment in the early 1990s.The alleged 1993 incident was initially deemed too old to be considered as evidence, but was recently admitted under the legal theory that the testimony could help support charges of predatory sexual assault, which carry a maximum life sentence and requires prosecutors to show a pattern of misconduct.The prosecution will attempt to prove that Weinstein is guilty of all five counts brought before the court, including two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of rape in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. Sciorra’s allegation cannot be charged separately, according to prosecutors.Weinstein has denied all wrongdoing, saying any sex that took place was consensual.Zoë Brock, a former model and writer from New Zealand who was part of that civil settlement, told the  that watching proceedings will be agonizing.“I’m heartbroken that I won’t have the opportunity to face him in court myself. I’m really disappointed. It’s been devastating,” said Brock, who has alleged Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances in a hotel room in 1997, forcing her to lock herself in the bathroom to escape.“I can definitely paint a picture that he was aided and abetted by people who worked for him, and some of the people who worked for him admitted to my face that he did it repeatedly.”The trial comes two years after New York Times and New Yorker investigations into widespread allegations of sexual abuse and harassment by Weinstein helped galvanise the #MeToo era – and a year after his arrest in 2018, when he was released on $1m bail.It also comes amid concerns that though Weinstein’s fall from Hollywood royalty to criminal defendant was a watershed cultural moment, he may not ultimately be held legally accountable for most of his alleged conduct.Such concerns were heightened in December, following reports that the Weinstein Company had reached a tentative $25m settlement deal in a civil case with more than 30 alleged sexual misconduct victims, which would not require Weinstein to admit any wrongdoing or pay anything out of his own pocket to his accusers.Weinstein’s lawyers insist he is innocent and will only need to sow doubt in the jurors’ minds since it’s up to the prosecution to meet the burden of proof, which is higher for criminal cases than civil ones.“Mr Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false, and he expects to be fully vindicated,” Weinstein lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a statement. The road to the trial has been long and gruelling. In October 2018, Weinstein lawyers got one of six criminal sex charges dismissed. But the defense subsequently failed to get other charges against Weinstein dropped in December 2018, after the judge ruled the court had found “no basis for the defendant’s claim of prosecutorial or law enforcement misconduct”.Last summer, prosecutors obtained a new indictment allowing for Sciorra to testify – a move a Weinstein’s lawyers called “desperate”. Weinstein’s lawyers faced another setback in October when the defense lost its bid to move the trial to another city: the court rejected the former producer’s concern that he wouldn’t get a fair trial in what his lawyers referred to as the “circus-like atmosphere” of media in New York. Unlike other high-profile court cases in the US, this trial will not be televised.﻿“I’m trying as much as I can to brace myself for the worst possible scenario,” the actor Katherine Kendall, one of the first women to speak out against Weinstein, told the . “And at the same time I feel really hopeful because this is a historic moment and it feels like the message could get out there to people that your stories matter and the judicial system will do something about it.”Kendall came forward as part of the New York Times’ initial investigation into Weinstein, alleging he harassed her in 1993. She has since sought out therapeutic resources, like the trauma workshops led by fellow Weinstein accuser Louise Godbold.“If this man walks free it is not just an insult to those of us who have lost friends, families, careers as a result of coming forward with the truth,” Godbold told the , “but it is sending a dangerous predator back into the world.”The former actor and screenwriter Louisette Geiss emphasized her frustration with the limited scope of the criminal trial. “In the class action we know of 150 women he’s affected,” Geiss told the .A mother to four, Geiss left Hollywood for real estate after she said Weinstein tried to make her to watch him masturbate in front of her as she was pitching a movie at the Sundance film festival in 2008.She now serves as co-chair of the $25m civil settlement against Weinstein and the Weinstein Company.“We all know that the court of public feelings are very important around these decisions and if he’s seen as this poor guy … that’s not going to fly,” she said, in reference to his recent media appearances.Weinstein has begun appearing with a walker, and while recovering from spinal surgery, he granted a rare photo opportunity and interview to the New York Post.“I feel like the forgotten man,” he told the Post. “I made more movies directed by women and about women than any film-maker, and I’m talking about 30 years ago. I’m not talking about now when it’s vogue. I did it first! I pioneered it!”Weinstein has said he sustained a serious back injury in a car accident in August last year. But some are skeptical of the optics of his interview.“He’s a wealthy man – he knows how to do PR for himself … So it is very important for us since we can’t be on the stand to make sure we let America know what a bad guy he is,” Geiss said.Things will only more heated once the trial begins on Monday, a housekeeping day when the judge will outline the schedule, and it’s expected to drag on for weeks. Jury selection is set to begin on Tuesday, and jurors have been told to prepare for a case lasting up to two months.The Los Angeles district attorney’s office is considering whether to bring charges in eight separate cases against Weinstein. London’s politan police force continues to investigate allegations of misconduct. But for now, all eyes are on the New York trial.“Considering every other horrific thing that happened so far in this criminal case with Harvey, I now live in the worst-case scenario,” Brock said.“The system is broken,” Brock continued. “And therefore no, I do not feel confident any more that the right thing will happen because life is not a Spielberg movie. I wish it was.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc739aebffec70b1e40073b2a3cd8472c2d60f8/0_6_4442_2664/master/4442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd03c74e95d5ea59cfe462c55ad618fb","title":"ricky gervais targets apple epstein and cats in golden globes monologue","story":"The controversial host returns to the Golden Globes with a monologue skewering everyone from Felicity Huffman to Joe PesciWith a drink in hand and an immediate promise that this would not happen again, Ricky Gervais kicked off his fifth time hosting the Golden Globes with a monologue skewering, among others: Twitter callouts, Felicity Huffman, Jeffrey Epstein, and award season’s moralizing speeches.The controversial British comedian, 58, promised before the show he’d go after “the general community. I’d go after cinema and I’d go after television and I’d go after actors and I’ll go after pretension and hypocrisy,” and for the most part, stuck to his promise. “Let’s have a laugh at your expense, shall we?” he said. “Remember, they’re just jokes, we’re all going to die soon.”Known for drawing audience gasps and Twitter outrage for his jokes – his 2016 bit on Caitlyn Jenner’s transition and her car crash in which another driver died drew particular ire – Gervais trained most of his scorn this year on the Hollywood industry. He traveled to the show in a limo, for instance, though his had a “license plate that was made by Felicity Huffman,” a reference to her trial over illegally buying her child’s way into college.From there Gervais stayed generally true to his don’t-care beat, sending up Hollywood’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein (“I know he’s your friend, but I don’t care”), Leonardo DiCaprio’s dating life (he attended The Irishman’s premiere and “by the end, his date was too old for him”) and Hollywood film and TV executives who are “all terrified of Ronan Farrow – he’s coming for you.”Gervais had some predictably uncomfortable bits: calling talk show host James Corden a “fat pussy” and a bleeped-out joke about Dame Judi Dench lifting her leg and licking ... something, but saved his most biting words for the industry’s moneymakers. “You say you’re woke but the companies you work for – Apple, Amazon, Disney – if Isis started a streaming service, you would call your agent, wouldn’t you?” he said, referencing Apple TV+’s The Morning Show’s theme of morality, “which is rich coming from a company that runs sweat shops in Asia”.“So if you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech, right?” he continued. “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world.”Noting that most people in the room “spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg”, Gervais capped his monologue with a caustic edict to the winners: “If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and God, and fuck off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc56186c93fb8693d6108259bff8dd503545036f/0_93_1987_1192/master/1987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b172fbb74e20fcf762e53d018f9825","title":"ricky gervais is wrong political engagement at the golden globes was essential","story":"Stars such as Russell Crowe, Michelle Williams and Joaquin Phoenix were right to ignore his request – the time for silence on issues more pressing than showbiz has long passed“You know nothing about the real world,” Ricky Gervais told the audience at Sunday night’s Golden Globe awards. “Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.” Should you win an award, he advised, “thank your agent and your God and fuck off.”Yet what unfolded at this year’s ceremony was a mass rejection of such apoliticism, with winner after winner using the stage as a platform for speaking up about, variously, climate change, abortion rights, democratic inclusivity, LGBT visibility, the dubiousness of Facebook’s ad checking policies.In theory, of course, Gervais is correct. Hollywood stars are obviously out of touch. However wryly intended, Joaquin Phoenix’s request that people think twice before from taking their private jet to Palm Springs wouldn’t have struck a chord with more than a dozen people in the room, and may have alienated many at home.But he’s mistaken if he believes the scepticism us plebs feel for Hollywood isn’t bound up not just with revulsion at its excesses but because everyday news currently trumps it time and time again for horrific drama – and wild comedy. A speech in which an actor remained wholly inside their bubble would now be far worse than one in which they acknowledged that bubble was expensively insulated within a burning building, in a city on fire.Political speeches used to be a turn-off, but that was when A-listers’ calls for action were largely in-house. However much they were at pains to link Hollywood’s problems with gender parity or racial bias or sexual harassment to the wider world, their anxieties always felt like first world concerns.This year, no one talked about the troubles in Tinseltown. Not even they care anymore. When Patricia Arquette called for wage equality in her 2014 Oscar acceptance speech, she was hailed as groundbreakingly radical. We have all moved on. This year Arquette spoke about “young people risking their lives”, “people not knowing if bombs are going to drop on their kids’ heads”, then begged everyone to try and “give our children a better world”.Gervais’s call for silence on what everyone is talking about marked another way in which his presence felt like a throwback to a previous era certainly a time before last year’s Oscars, when the necessity of the Kevin Hart implosion meant the ceremony went host-less – to unanimous acclaim.However clever or irreverent, the presence of one man telling us all how it’s going to go simply no longer sits easily. And, three hours after his initial instruction, even Gervais seemed more in the mood to ignore it. Introducing Sandra Bullock to announce the final award, he said: “Our next presenter starred in Netflix’s Bird Box, a movie where people survive by acting like they don’t see a thing. Sort of like working for Harvey Weinstein.”This was a considerable escalation of the acid reserved for the people in the room, less than a day before Weinstein’s trial is set to start. Gervais’s final words did not relate to Hollywood, however. They were: “Please donate to Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19da6ccb6c17f8e4e1fc4fcc755463ab8affb04c/17_31_1631_979/master/1631.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0452428cd864eb1bfca5f9cf594ec54f","title":"gowns and gongs golden globes 2020 in pictures","story":"A selection of pictures from the awards show in Beverly Hills, California"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718e198fcb121dcf2c06c83a3bea5f7eef8455b3/0_185_3690_2214/master/3690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e63f7aadee5d36ba38bad5c17a2e91","title":"golden globes 2020 the winners the losers the return of ricky gervais live","story":"Fleabag and 1917 were big winners in a night that saw Ricky Gervais try to offend the Hollywood eliteIt was a rather lacklustre night at the Globes, a shame for a star-packed ceremony that can often be rather loose and fun, despite some wacky choices. There were less alcohol-fuelled antics and although host Ricky Gervais kept promising to set fire to the rich and famous, all he did was throw a wet sparkler.The awards themselves were a mixed bag but one with more treats than tricks with some deserved small screen prizes for Fleabag, Succession and Chernobyl and some pleasing wins for Sam Mendes, Renee Zellweger and Awkwafina on the big screen. Interestingly, one of the biggest contenders of the night, The Irishman, went home empty-handed and its backer Netflix almost did the same, scooping up just two awards from its 34 nominations.By the end the night told or reinforced to us a number of things: being an awards show host remains a thankless task, 1917 is a genuine best picture contender at the Oscars and Michelle Williams gives a more convincing speech than most politicians. For now, it’s over but awards season has just begun. Aaaaand here’s the full news wrap:Here’s another one of the night’s most emotive speeches in case you haven’t yet seen:It’s not just Gervais who critics are faulting but the event itself. Here’s Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson:“What are the Golden Globes for in 2020? Mostly just a few hours of celebrity gazing, at this point. A stretch of time that, yes, can occasionally swell to something grander, something dimly approaching important, but is otherwise only a starry and distant evening to enjoy—or not—in January, just as the page has turned on another year. Maybe that’s all the show can be right now, for better and worse. Or that’s just complacency talking and the real solution—to the Golden Globes, not the world’s troubles—is to do some kind of radical shakeup next year. To introduce some actually edgy host, to honor a bold and forward-thinking array of nominees, to conjure up a sense that all the glitz has a real cultural sum to it. I’ll toast to that possibility, even if it means I’m lame for caring.”Here’s a look back at some of the most notable outfits on the red carpet:Here’s that Michelle Williams speech that you’ll all be reading about tomorrow:While Netflix went into the night with the most nominations, on the small screen side it was HBO who came out on top with four wins and, importantly for the network long-term, none of them were for Game of Thrones.For the New York Times, James Poniewozik had the following to say about Gervais:“Gervais himself doesn’t care about the Globes so much that he was hosting them for the fifth time. He and everyone knew why he was there: to administer Hollywood a mostly consensual lashing, to be the Nihilist-in-Chief, the guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks. He had a joke about Felicity Huffman’s jail sentence in a college-admissions scandal, and a heavily censored one imagining Judi Dench, of “Cats,” grooming herself in, er, a feline manner.It was sometimes uncomfortable, but not especially daring.”A cursory look of Film Twitter and some early reviews might suggest that Ricky Gervais was a flop host tonight but not if you look much further to the right.Controversial former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch tweeted that he was “the ballsiest host ever”. Breitbart reporter Alana Mastrangelo tweeted that he’s “the only one who deserves an award tonight”. Ben Shapiro called it “the BEST THING EVER”. Candace Owens praised him as “a celebrity with the balls to clue Hollywood in on the painstakingly obvious truth that we DO NOT CARE WHAT THEY THINK”. So congrats to Ricky.Yeah about those Joaquin F-bombs that were removed from the almost live broadcast earlier. Here they are! “To my fellow nominees, we all know there’s no fucking competition between us” “There is no fucking best actor”“Contrary to popular belief, I don’t want to rock the boat. But the boat is fucking rocked” Full video on its wayAnd here’s how it all began with what’s allegedly, hopefully the last ever Ricky Gervais Globes opening monologue:This is an important and deeply embarrassing question:It’s been a night as long as an Irishman so in case you need to go back and check who won what then here’s a handy list:Another first of the night: Awkwafina has become the first Asian-American woman to win the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy filmSad but true but also amazing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1019d9c3a88c28b360f17640d526c53d972841b/123_135_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e1a3f20fb66ef4cbf56a2412249f74e","title":"chelsea reading womens super league match report","story":"Sam Kerr’s all-action Chelsea debut yielded everything but a goal as Emma Hayes’s side came from behind at home to Reading.“It was pretty high-paced,” said the forward of her introduction to the Women’s Super League just over a week after landing in London. “I’ve been a bit rusty coming back from a break but I always want to start.”The Australian provided her first assist in a Chelsea shirt, for Beth England, and was responsible for Reading’s reduction in their numbers after Grace Moloney was shown red for taking out the NWSL and W-League record goalscorer. Second-half goals from Guro Reiten and the substitute Erin Cuthbert ensured the Blues keep pace in the title race after Fara Williams had given Reading an early lead.After the game Kerr highlighted the devastating bushfires ravaging her home country. “It has been really tough. You feel quite helpless over here. Hopefully it can gain the media coverage it deserves like other natural disasters,” she said. “It is really sad and tough but hopefully everyone at home has had some rain overnight and it gets better.”Hayes was keen to praise the attitude of her recruit. “She’s a doll,” she said in her best faux-Aussie voice. “She’s humble, hardworking, honest, thoughtful. An unbelievable team player, she cares about what the team think of her and she will work and do her job for the team at any point. You have top players but to have a top player who is a top person? Happy days.”Ebony Salmon punished her former club Manchester United as Bristol City earned their first league win of the season.

Arsenal maintained their three-point lead at the top – Kim Little’s header and a half-volley from Jordan Nobbs sealing a 2-0 win over Birmingham. Manchester City stayed one point ahead of Chelsea with a 4-1 win over Tottenham. Two goals from Pauline Bremer and one each from Ellen White and Lauren Hemp cancelled out Rianna Dean\u0027s penalty.\u0026nbspIt took only two minutes for Kerr to find herself clean through and yet, having taken a touch to set herself up, the prolific striker skied her shot over the bar. New club nerves perhaps? “I was nervous,” said Kerr, grinning, who has an ability to peel off the shoulder of defenders like no other. “It was my first one on one in a few months. I haven’t been playing much so I was nervous. But it will come, get the jitters out and it’s only my first game. I can go from here.”Talk before her arrival about whether the in-form England would lose out was quickly fast answered when the pair were handed starting berths alongside each other in a 4-1-3-2 designed to get the best out of both. “Two years ago,” joked Hayes when asked when she had decided to start Kerr.And it was the new strike partnership that would find the equaliser after Williams’ opener. “Oh what a backheel,” purred Hayes, of the pass to England, who then rounded the stand-in goalkeeper Rachael Laws to score. “It’s exciting to see the pair of them together and I’m sure they’re happy to get the first one out the way.”The celebrations from the forward looked full of the relief of a player who has had to field and dodge questions about the threat of Kerr to her own position since the latter’s signing was announced in November. “It’s nice playing with Beth,” said Kerr. “I feel like we’ve just connected really quickly. She’s a quality player and hopefully she can keep scoring because we need her.”What one of the hottest forward lines in the league could not hide though is a defensive fragility.One minute after Williams had swept low past Ann-Katrin Berger, Kerr sprung to life up the other end. Catching some hesitation between Jo Potter and her goalkeeper, Moloney, the forward swept across the edge of the box, nicking the ball ahead of the keeper, who clattered into her and handled the ball outside the box at the same time, earning a red card.In the second half an excellent Laws was helpless as, after blocking a Kerr effort with her legs, the ball looped to the feet of Reiten on the edge of the box and her side-footed volley flew over her into an otherwise unguarded net.Chelsea extended their lead with 15 minutes to play, Jonna Andersson flying down the left and volleying a cross on to the head of England. Laws did well to keep the shot out but Cuthbert was first to the loose ball to kill the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdc9c4dfeb756cb54481b40b01467069cbcf789a/0_184_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d43dcf4fed3a858431b596d3aa03481f","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool carlo ancelotti everton teenagers reserves reality check","story":"The Merseyside derby offered Everton a golden opportunity to break a winless streak at Anfield stretching back to 1999Jürgen Klopp had hinted he might be daring with his team selection and, with nine changes and a handful of debuts, the Liverpool manager did not disappoint. The question before kick-off at Anfield was whether the coolest manager in the Premier League had really picked a side to ramp up the pressure on Everton even more, by presenting them with callow opposition they ostensibly ought to beat, or whether Klopp was simply interested in avoiding a replay at all costs.Carlo Ancelotti’s comments pre-match that Everton’s performance would have to be perfect was based on the assumption they would be facing the world champions and runaway league leaders, not an assortment of teenagers and reserves who lost a father figure in James Milner after six minutes. On this evidence, though, it must be admitted that behind Liverpool’s extremely settled and successful first team is a raft of hugely impressive talent on the way up.Takumi Minamino is not your average rookie in search of experience but Neco Williams looked as if he had been playing at this level all season and, when Yasser Larouci came on for Milner, he looked even more composed and confident on the left. The icing on the cake was a wonderfully assured winner from Curtis Jones, an 18-year-old scouser.There were no Liverpool-born players in the Everton team, and maybe there should have been but Jones showed the local production line does not stop at Trent Alexander-Arnold. Not only did he beat the England goalkeeper with a perfectly executed right-foot curler from the edge of the area but, from the way he pointed to the space in front of him to indicate to Divock Origi where he wanted the ball played, he clearly had a picture in his mind of exactly what he wanted to do.Whether the same can be said of Ancelotti after this reality check is debatable. Even before the Jones moment it had been a strikingly sub-par Everton performance, otherwise the visitors might have been two or three up at half-time. Adrián did well to keep out attempts from Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Mason Holgate and Richarlison, though in each case the ball seemed to travel straight to the goalkeeper rather than heading for the space around him.What was more significant was the role Theo Walcott played in most of Everton’s early attacks. Given a free role to get forward in support of the front two, Walcott’s ability to find space on the right and through the middle gave his side a penetrative edge that better finishing would have turned into an advantage.Calvert-Lewin has been the poster boy for Everton’s revival since the departure of Marco Silva, yet he needed to be stronger and sharper here, if only because he will not get that many opportunities to play against a Liverpool defence lacking Virgil van Dijk. When Walcott delivered his best cross of the first half Calvert-Lewin launched himself at it a fraction too early. When he had the opportunity to play in the better-placed Djibril Sidibé just before the interval he instead dragged a shot narrowly wide.In both cases he would not have found himself in as much space against the regular Liverpool defence. Holgate might have been guilty of missing the best chance of the evening, though as a defender he has a ready-made excuse. Calvert-Lewin has been bullied on occasion by Van Dijk this season and probably imagined he would be in for another bruising encounter in the Cup tie but, given an unexpected amount of freedom, he was unable to show the sort of incisiveness Ancelotti will have been looking for.Everton were left to regret their first-half profligacy as Liverpool stepped up their efforts and kept them pinned back after the break. They were unable to manage a second-half shot on target and, when Walcott squandered a promising situation with a jaw-droppingly awful pass just before Liverpool scored, it was easy to see why. He was withdrawn soon afterwards though, if some of his first-half efforts had got the rewards they deserved, he might have been the game’s decisive figure. Instead that honour falls jointly to Jones for his goal and Klopp for his nerve, though when you have squad resources this good at your disposal, it would be remiss not to use them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2882d0bcd232842c85895d88828f033ddfd44e/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c23b59c344308bca29c33e0550c858","title":"fa cup third round 10 talking points","story":"Lallana may yet have a key role at Liverpool, Derby should be higher in the league and Leicester see value in trophy-winningListening to Dean Smith after a second-string Aston Villa’s 2-1 defeat at Fulham, it was hard not to conclude the FA Cup is trapped in a cycle of mutually assured destruction. It had, bar outstanding goals by Anthony Knockaert and Harry Arter, been a turgid afternoon’s football and Smith did not hide the fact he was happy to be spared further distraction. Asked for his feelings about, as the questioner put it, “a great competition”, Smith replied “I think it was, I think it’s lost its sparkle” and went on to cite unfriendly kick-off times and the scheduling of previous finals on the same day as top-flight fixtures. It was a damning use of the past tense and the conundrum is clear: the more managers feel the Cup is not being respected from the top down, the less likely they are to bother with it the more managers select shadow teams that can barely produce a spectacle, the less likely the authorities are to put the competition back on a pedestal. How can a way out be found? Nick AmesBrendan Rodgers was quick to dismiss the notion that Leicester City have a free hit at the domestic cups because their Premier League rivals are scrambling for a top-four finish but acknowledged reaching the final of a competition would act as a reward for their rapid progress. After an FA Cup third-round victory over Wigan on Saturday, Leicester host Aston Villa in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday and Rodgers recognises the value of going the distance. Leicester won the league four years ago but have not reached a final since winning the League Cup in 2000. “We will fight to get to the final,” said Rodgers, who will welcome back Jamie Vardy following a calf complaint. “And that gives you the opportunity to have something tangible to show for your development over the course of the period.” Ben Fisher“It was a little bit awkward,” Tom Pope reflected. “John wouldn’t speak to me.” The post-match meeting of the two teams in the dressing room was affected by the Port Vale top scorer’s tweets about John Stones. Perhaps, however, Claudio Bravo should have been the one giving Pope the silent treatment. Pope converted Vale’s first, and indeed only, effort on target. It is a recurring theme in Bravo’s chastening City career, dating back to his dreadful debut year when Pep Guardiola used to complain his side kept conceding to the first shot without rationalising why. Recently, Liverpool, Atalanta and Dinamo Zagreb have scored with their first shots on target against Bravo, Everton and Southampton with their second. Those initial efforts have veered from the unstoppable to the rather stoppable. Whether luckless or useless, Bravo’s presence can seem to gift the opposition a goal head-start and make it feel that City are playing with 10 men. Richard JollyRochdale’s life-affirming comeback against Newcastle was a triumph for 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham, 17-year-old Luke Matheson who created the latter’s equaliser, and Brian Barry-Murphy, whose decision to introduce them as substitutes proved inspired. The manager boldly removed a terrorised Tyler Magloire on 30 minutes for Matheson before Wilbraham entered ahead of the second half and the striker subsequently fired in Matheson’s 79th-minute cross to cancel out Miguel Almirón’s opener. Wilbraham is a 22-year, 10-club veteran who lost his mother to illness last month. Of the equaliser he said: “It meant a lot. My mum was my biggest fan. Obviously for the family and everyone at the moment it’s been a hard time. She drove me everywhere when I was younger in a little brown Fiesta, with about £2.50 petrol money in to make training. I never had my dad around when I was younger so she was the only one.” Jamie JacksonTranmere’s three-goal comeback against Watford definitely had something magic about it. A team that had looked down and out and out of their depth gathered themselves and gave their all to get a result. But on the other side, Watford collapsed, with too many youngsters and no sense of collective responsibility. Perhaps, then, what these teams brought to the Cup was as important as what the Cup brought to them. Tranmere’s Micky Mellon believed his team needed a performance to prove they were still on the up after promotion from League Two last year. For Nigel Pearson, however, there was a dispassionate analysis that said defeat was better than losing first-team players to injury. In a sense his point was proven as one rare regular, Nathaniel Chalobah, was forced off at half-time. But the jolt in Watford’s momentum, not to mention a replay in Birkenhead, may come back to bother him yet. Paul MacInnesOle Gunnar Solskjær revealed a different side of himself before and after his team’s trip to Molineux. On Friday, he reacted to Robin van Persie’s suggestion that he was too nice to manage Manchester United, wielding club legend status by reminding that he, scorer of that goal on that famous night in Barcelona and many others besides, and not the one-season wonder Dutchman, is a true keeper of the faith. It was a baring of teeth that his former colleagues, including an approving Roy Keane, say he has always been capable of. And following a positive post-match verdict on another insipid performance, in which his team hung on for a replay, Solskjær turned his attention back to Van Persie’s criticisms. “There are different ways to motivate and inspire players, and I do not always believe in scaring them to play better,” he said. “After all, we are in 2020.” John BrewinDerby County’s victory over Crystal Palace was ultimately another game in which the use of VAR became the main topic of discussion. Rightly so given the potentially pivotal use of the pitchside monitor by the referee, Michael Oliver, but that should not completely take away from an assured display by Phillip Cocu’s men against opponents who sit a ision above them. Wayne Rooney was key to that but there were also impressive showings from others in white and black, in particular Curtis Davies and Tom Huddlestone, and watching on there came the strong sense that Derby have too much experience as well as quality to be 17th in the Championship for much longer. Derby may not reach the play-offs – they are currently eight points off Swansea in sixth – but a serious push up the table should be well within their reach. Sachin NakraniChelsea’s reliance on Tammy Abraham was underlined again during their victory over Nottingham Forest. With Abraham given a welcome rest Michy Batshuayi was handed a rare start up front and Olivier Giroud was on the bench. Yet Batshuayi struggled to make an impact in general play and Giroud was an unused substitute once again. Lampard is not a fan of either forward and it would be a risk for him not to find cover for Abraham this month, especially as Giroud is desperate to leave. Aston Villa are the latest club to target the former Arsenal striker, with Internazionale, Lyon, Bordeaux and Crystal Palace also interested in striking a deal for the 33-year-old, whose lack of football this season has put his place in the France squad under threat before Euro 2020. Chelsea, who are interested in Red Bull Leipzig’s Timo Werner and Lyon’s Moussa Dembélé, need to find a solution quickly.As Everton made desperately heavy weather of a Merseyside derby that looked laid out for them to finally win at Anfield, Liverpool’s oldest outfield head was a key influence in their deep disappointment. Once James Milner had departed prematurely – and worryingly for Jürgen Klopp – Adam Lallana took Milner’s armband and a leadership role he has rarely fulfilled since he gave up the captaincy of Southampton to head north. He nursed his stripling colleagues and debutant Takumi Minamino along as Everton were dominated. Injuries and the claims of other midfielders better suited to Klopp’s style have restricted his impact but with injuries piling up, Lallana may yet play a role in Liverpool’s path to the Premier League title. This is his sixth season at Anfield, more than likely the last, but he reminded he is someone who can be counted upon. JBJosé Mourinho enjoys semantics but, in distinguishing between VAR and what he calls “VR”, Tottenham’s manager made a real, and important, distinction. After lamenting the absence of video technology at the Riverside as Middlesbrough earned a deserved replay (Mourinho believed Ashley Fletcher’s goal should have been disallowed for offside) – he explained that he applauded the idea of a VAR being used to support referees’ decisions. However the system he has seen in use in the Premier League this season is, in practice “VR” – or a dictatorial remote referee. “I like VAR but I don’t like VR and we have VR,” said Mourinho. There was still a time for a detour into semantics, namely when he suggested Tottenham’s squad was so anorexic and inflexible they were now condemned to “playing without a striker” in Harry Kane’s hamstrung absence. That may surprise both Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min.

Tucked behind, up a slight hill, where the buildings become bare brick and the tarmac road turns into a dust track, people sit on the ground in the afternoon sun, talking and playing cards.These are the Roma, or the Roma who remain in Hungary, where they live on society’s edge, clinging on in the outskirts of towns and villages, shunned and stigmatised as potential criminals.Many have left, seeking a better life elsewhere in Europe, often in the UK. Poor and marginalised, they are easy pickings for traffickers who post adverts on Facebook promising a bright future for those prepared to travel.Many have succumbed to the temptation. A lot of young people have gone to the UK to work, say the people playing cards. One man who gives his name as Kalman says his 27-year-old sister has gone to Britain, to marry a Turkish man she had never met.An older man says many of his relatives have gone too. For a better life, he says.A woman holding a baby comes to the gate of her house. Sabrina says her sister is living in the UK after answering an advert on Facebook for an arranged marriage to an Iraqi man who wanted EU paperwork. The sister thought she’d simply have a better life. Sabrina’s husband emerges and shouts to her to come away from the gate.London, Manchester, Sheffield, Bolton, Leeds, Bristol – these are some of the cities where people have heard they can make money. The line between economic migration and exploitation is ill-defined: some who travel are aware of the risks but prepared to take a chance, others think they are off to start a better life only to end up in modern slavery.“It usually starts with some kind of promise that it is going to a better life,” says Agnes De Coll, head of anti-trafficking for Hungarian Baptist Aid, an NGO working with the country’s police. Young women in particular are vulnerable to traffickers who befriend them with promises of romance. “Most of the times they are afraid of the cities, they don’t know the language, they live in the rented apartment where they are doing the sex work and they don’t know anything better.“It is so frightening for someone coming from a village. It is shocking. That’s why they stay, because they are so afraid. It makes them even more vulnerable, more attached to the pimp.”Baptist Aid can get about 40 or 50 a year into shelters and help maybe another 100 more, but thousands of Hungarians are in similar positions around Europe. Jobs are advertised on Facebook, she says. One girl answered an advert for a babysitter. At the interview she was taken in a car to Slovakia and kept for two weeks until other girls arrived and then they were taken to the UK.They were told they could choose to be a prostitute or the wife of someone from a developing country. That girl escaped, she says, but blackmail is a problem. “There is usually a money-lender in the villages where the Roma live on the edges of towns and villages and they are always blackmailing the families every day, asking for more and more.“Sometimes they make the family work without pay to work off their debt and after a while they figure that if there is a young daughter in the family they can get rid of the debt. They threaten them with all kinds of things.”Rachel Harper, helpline manager for the UK anti-trafficking charity Unseen, says it has picked up dozens of cases of exploitation. “Traffickers know where to find vulnerable iniduals and how to target them, including online,” she says. “Cases of modern slavery, across various types of exploitation, have been reported to the Modern Slavery Helpline where the potential exploiter initially contacted the potential victim, recruited them or exerted control via social media.”Ion answered an advert on Facebook promising work and housing, but he reached the UK to be told he owed his trafficker money. He was threatened with violence, the wages he earned from a factory job taken from him.Mihai thought the advert he saw on Facebook would lead to a proper factory job, but he ended up picking vegetables for less than minimum wage, threatened with violence, even murder, kept in cramped accommodation and allowed no freedom.Maria Szuda stands in the darkness outside her apartment in the town of Orosháza, 200km south-east of Budapest, drawing heavily on a cigarette, her face lit by the glow of her phone as she scrolls and then points at the screen – a Facebook page, post after post of adverts for work in or travel to the UK.Facebook was where her 32-year-old daughter Ivett was recruited. She has been in jail since January when a British jury convicted her and her husband Karl Ring, 34, of controlling the prostitution of women trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation.“Ten floors of whores”, a tabloid headlined the case: a London apartment block in Chelsea where Hungarians were brought in to work as prostitutes.The court heard they used low-cost airline Wizz Air to fly the women in before forcing them into sex work. Szuda had worked as a prostitute herself, the judge said, before marrying Ring - a former client.Ivett Szuda may not have been an innocent abroad, despite her mother’s protestations to the contrary, but researchers investigating trafficking from Hungary to the UK say many are and that social media has a key role in recruitment. The UN and European commission both list the UK as a major destination for Hungarians trafficked into labour exploitation. Other countries, notably Germany, the Netherlands and France, have higher rates of sexual exploitation but the UK is becoming an increasingly important destination.The European commission’s Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings document describes Hungary as “primarily a source and transit country for women and girls subjected to trafficking for sexual exploitation and for men and women for trafficking for labour exploitation”. It is not an ethnic problem – there are both Roma and non-Roma – more one of poverty, poor education and high unemployment, says Hungarian trafficking expert Viktoria Sebhelyi.Curious about the role of social media in recruitment, Sebhelyi teamed up with child psychologist Dora Varga-Sabján to create a Facebook profile purporting to be that of a 16-year-old Hungarian girl. They suspected that the platform was being used by people involved in trafficking to groom vulnerable young women who did not have a strong family network.The character they created was described as living in care and new to Facebook. They had her join some popular groups and sat back to watch what happened next. Within two weeks the profile was contacted by 116 people – 108 men and eight women, aged from 19 to 65.People added her to other closed groups. She was put in secret makeup and haircare groups where recruitment was going on. The men tended to open with a compliment – “Hi, I like your eyes” – even though the researchers had only posted an avatar.“I just want to make new friends. Is it okay? I don’t want anything more. I just want to understand you.”The researchers replied politely, making clear that the “girl” was under the age of 18 and asking if that was OK. Of course, they told her. Don’t worry.Then they asked more questions, probing for weaknesses. “Do you have a good relationship with your parents? Do you have a lot of girlfriends? How close are you?”It didn’t take long – sometimes just a couple of chats – for the subject to turn to sex. Some men talked about sex after only two brief chats. There were naked pictures and questions about her own sex life. In the closed groups, there were leading questions.“How did you get that look, did your parents buy it? No? Oh, your parents are dead, oh that’s interesting.”It was clear, says Sebhelyi, that these were the same methods used in trafficking: the identification of a vulnerable target and then the grooming.Twitter’s own rules prohibit the promotion of adult sexual content globally, including pornography, escort services and prostitution, though the existence of the #escort hashtag seems to fly in the face of this policy. Facebook forbids the publication of content that attempts to coordinate or recruit for adult sexual activities.The challenge for anyone trying to prevent recruitment through Facebook or Twitter posts is the speed at which they appear and disappear and, as Sebhelyi notes, the ease with which victims can be drawn into private groups away from public scrutiny. The Facebook page Maria Szuda was looking for was one of the largest UK forums for Hungarians - Legnagyobb Info Oldal Nagy-Britanniában.An array of messages advertise jobs and services, including people arranging travel to the UK. Most will be honest: spotting rogue ads is virtually impossible. But there are other less innocent sites publicly visible. One of the largest advertisers of sexual services in Hungary - red-life.net - has a Facebook listing redirecting to its website, where sex work is advertised both in Hungary and abroad, including the UK. Red-life is also on Twitter.The Lyukó valley, on the edge of the north-eastern industrial city of Miskolc, is not a place where the government takes care of people, says Andrew Turro, a coordinator with the Roma self-government. The old mining area is filled with shacks, interspersed with a few more substantial houses. There are green hills and fruit and vegetable gardens, horses and carts, old cars and farming machinery.“People prefer to live in the UK. They have work and a decent living and it is better than Hungary because they are not targeted as much,” he says. One man says his daughters are working in the UK, but he doesn’t know what they are doing. They’re working as prostitutes, says Turro, as he tries to get the attention of a neighbour whose husband is away taking people to the UK, mostly women.“I’ve got a lot of friends working abroad,” a younger woman says. “During the past four years a lot of people have left here. There’s very little money that people can make here.” Many children grow up thinking they want to work abroad, but they don’t end up happy, she says. István and his daughters went to the UK with a middleman. He worked in construction, they danced in a club near Manchester and had sex with men in the rooms above. Their employers held their passports and stopped them leaving.Prostitution is regarded as a practical route out of poverty, even if it is exploitative, says Gabor Varady, leader of the Roma minority self-government in Miskolc. “There is a certain sorrow that for family or economic reasons these girls are forced to do this. No one would want to do this, it is a last straw, it is not a pensionable job.“But someone working as a prostitute in the UK will make as much in a month as I do in half a year. How do you tell them to stop?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f449293291d9fbfba3a22854d5565ae9272559b/0_0_5138_3082/master/5138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021d667ffaeb78c7ed8bb53eda9605c2","title":"five ways to cure and prevent chapped lips","story":"Dietary supplements may work and the right lip balm is useful – but avoid lickingChapped lips are common in winter, says Daniel Glass, a consultant dermatologist at the Dermatology Clinic, because of exposure to cold air outside and dry, centrally heated air inside. “Keratin, which forms the top layer of your skin, loses its flexibility and the lips become sore, cracked and scaly,” he says. “Many patients who have chapped lips are lip-lickers. Repeated licking can remove the oily surface film that protects the lips from losing moisture, leading to lips cracking. The digestive enzymes in saliva can also irritate the lips.”“You want a lip balm that has emollient properties, smoothing the surface of the skin and acting as an occlusive agent, locking in moisture,” says the cosmetic dermatologist Sam Bunting. “I like lanolin and petroleum, which do both. If you are skiing or hitting the beach this winter, you’ll want the addition of SPF, as lips burn easily.” Reapply lip balm every few hours and before bed, “as many of us with colds will mouth-breathe during sleep, which is very drying”.“Lip balms can sometimes contain ingredients such as camphor and menthol, which create a pleasant, tingly ‘active’ sensation when applied,” says Bunting. “But they can irritate, leading to lips, paradoxically, getting drier with use, so I don’t recommend them. And if you use actives-based skincare, such as retinol, be sure to barrier off the lips with lip balm before applying it at night to avoid flaky, irritated lips.” Some lipsticks can also be drying.“Don’t confuse a recurring cold sore with chapped lips. And don’t ignore a non-healing scab – lips are a common site for skin cancer so get your GP to refer you to a dermatologist for further assessment,” recommends Bunting. If your lips do become dry and chapped, Glass explains they “can be effectively treated by gentle exfoliation to ensure you are removing any dry, flaky skin from the surface and regularly moisturising with a good quality lip balm or moisturiser”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc3d03308cb867694524c6b17b38061b9df4c8d6/0_44_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c17abb4649f95ae1f0a6abbc21c71f4a","title":"how weight loss surgery saved my life","story":"I have felt fat since I was eight years old. But a gastric sleeve procedure gave me the head start I needed and finally put health and happiness in sightI don’t remember a time when I didn’t feel fat. While I started piling on the pounds in my late teens, I was teased as young as eight for being chubby. The idea stuck. I remember overhearing my mum saying that she was worried I would get anorexia: I didn’t even know what that was. Suffice to say, I never did. I felt fat long before I truly had a fat body, but eventually the latter caught up with the former. I tried to diet on and off from my late teens to my late 30s, but nothing stuck. I was deeply, painfully unhappy.I didn’t have a boyfriend throughout my 20s. Then, aged 30, I met my now ex-husband online, but that relationship was not without its complexities and I continued to gain weight. We got married in 2008. When we split up in 2013, I lost control and lived on junk food for a summer. I have always been an emotional eater and it was a vicious cycle. I was unhappy because I was fat, I ate because I was unhappy, then I gained weight because I ate.Then I made a decision to save my own life. I went to my GP and, as always, they asked about my weight – at 162kg (25 and a half stone), I was morbidly obese. This time, the doctor suggested weight-loss surgery.At first, I balked. I had never been to hospital for anything more serious than a broken bone, never stayed overnight or had surgery. At my weight, there were serious risks of complications and a small but real possibility I could die on the table. I remember walking down the street to work and stopping in my tracks at the thought of that.But as I walked down the street I was in agony – a fact I never shared with anyone, although I suspect they knew. I couldn’t walk for more than a minute without being in extreme pain. My back would seize up and my shins would burn from the strain I was putting them under. I knew I had to do something.So, in December 2013, I went to hospital for gastric sleeve surgery. This is where a large part of your stomach is cut away so you can eat only small portions before you get full. The surgery took four hours. Afterwards, I had to be woken every few hours and made to walk up and down the corridor because of the risk of deep vein thrombosis. The discomfort was bad for a week and I had a month of recovery before I could return to work.People can be really weird about weight-loss surgery. Some think it is a “cheat”. Others think that I have wasted NHS money, despite the fact that I’ve probably saved them a fortune in treating the complications that might otherwise have arisen from my obesity. As a society, we make such moral judgments around weight gain and loss and the right and wrong ways of doing it. People treated me as a failure when I was fat despite my good job and life. People laud my weight loss when they see it, but there is sometimes a sense of disappointment in me when they realise it wasn’t done through what they determine as willpower.But it was. The surgery is only the start. I have met people for whom it didn’t work who cheated the surgery. Having the surgery doesn’t guarantee success – it gives you a head start. You still have to commit to your weight loss and work bloody hard at it.That head start was what I needed. A chance to see a difference quickly and to turn my downward spiral into a positive feedback loop. One month after the surgery, I was walking for 30 minutes or more without pain. I now walk everywhere I can, trying to get at least 10,000 steps a day.The stomach is a muscle, so after a while it stretches back to a normal size. I can now eat standard portions of food (although nothing like what I used to consume). I am not yet at my ideal weight and have joined Slimming World to get to my target, which is 16kg lighter than I am now.I used to be a size 30 now I am a size 14. I used to loathe shopping now I love it. The feeling of there being choices available to me that there never used to be is exhilarating. I used to avoid walking with others because the pain I was hiding made me quiet and unsocial now I regularly tramp around the marshes near my home for miles with family and friends. Whereas I used to go home alone, now my life is, at times, full of dating and fun.I have a confidence I never used to. I know things about me that were hidden under layers of fat and insecurity. I like my face now it has angles. I am even learning to like myself. It is hard and I don’t know if I will feel completely at ease with myself, even when I do achieve that final loss. But I no longer hate myself – and that is a powerful feeling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/989f975fc28a6463f723dcb86c69176aef532ab3/0_206_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461cf342f51d86e3cd3d281707c8db35","title":"most affordable commuter towns five uk cities revealed","story":"Property website Zoopla ranks Grays in Essex as best-value location within hour of LondonThe most affordable towns for people commuting into London, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh have been revealed.With rail fares rising for many commuters, the property website Zoopla combined season ticket and mortgage costs to work out the best-value locations for those looking to live within an hour’s travel time of the five cities.Grays in Essex topped the list for London with a combined annual cost of £15,008 for a mortgage and season ticket, ahead of Leagrave in Bedfordshire (£15,399).Elsewhere, Wolverhampton (£7,483) was the most affordable option for Birmingham, with Cannock second (£7,933).

Highbridge, in Somerset, was second (£11,595).Laura Howard, a consumer expert at Zoopla, said: “The past decade has seen significant property price growth in prime London commuter belt towns, but despite this, our analysis still picks out pockets across south-east England that represent affordable value for commuters.“Areas outside London and the south-east are generally more affordable, but commuters can still save money on their daily travel into the likes of Birmingham and Bristol by looking at towns they might not have yet considered, but still have good transport links.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/411e7da47bdbb38c9211551fdf5877d709632490/0_235_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1640102a8af21ef7c5e46b71d8873f34","title":"uk employers fewer entry level jobs 2020 survey","story":"Survey shows slowdown in graduate recruitment accounts for bulk of decline Young workers will be forced to compete for fewer positions this year, as data suggests that the entry-level jobs market is set to stagnate.However, even this figure could prove optimistic after its research found that student recruiters are failing to hit their targets, pointing to a potential stagnation across the jobs market.A slowdown in graduate recruitment accounts for the bulk of the decline, though the survey also pointed to a slowdown in hiring of school leavers and apprentices in the months ahead.The research paints a worrying picture for young adults hoping to secure white-collar jobs across the country and appears to be part of a trend.Many of the jobs created in the UK over the past decade are too senior for students fresh out of school or university or are low-skilled, requiring little to no training.Figures collected by the Institute of Employment Studies show that of the 3.4m jobs created over the last 10 years, just 400,000 were classified as skilled and semi-skilled. Around 2.5m were considered professional or senior jobs, and were mostly taken by older, more experienced workers, while about 500,000 were classified as low-skilled.“What we’re seeing now is particularly concerning as employers are normally over optimistic at this time of the year. As we move through the recruitment season they typically recruit less than they had anticipated.”Isherwood said: “Outside the public sector the market is not looking particularly healthy. Government needs to get the economy moving otherwise this year we’ll be in for a stagnant graduate labour market at best.

I’m not impressed by the delay of months for a repair or replacement as I feel I have been sold an unsafe product. I’d like a refund to get a new machine now. That’s not what is being offered, and the company is hard to get hold of. My family is sporty and always covered in mud, so I have to use the machine.I bought it from a local independent retailer and it reassured me that the risk of a proper fire (as opposed to the door lock melting and stopping the machine working) is very small. But as I continue to use it, I worry it will invalidate the offer to repair or replace. What are my options?The timing of the recall of more than half a million washing machines just before Christmas could not have been worse. Once customers were able to overcome a broken website and jammed phone lines, Whirlpool provided confusing advice by telling customers their options were to unplug the machine, or to use it on a cool 20C setting.It sought to reassure customers that they will be eligible for a free like-for-like replacement or repair, regardless of whether they choose to use it or not. It says it is gearing up to offer replacement and repair appointments from Thursday 9 January, calling it “a complex operation which takes time”.However, Which? consumer rights expert Adam French warns: “The only way to remove the risk is not to use the machine, and there are reports that insurers will not cover damage from a fire that starts in one of the faulty machines.“To rub further salt into the wound, it is unclear about how long it will take to get a repair or replacement, leaving customers frustrated as they could potentially be left for months, or even years, with an unsafe machine, as owners of some of Whirlpool’s potentially dangerous dryers have found.”Which? urges Whirlpool to offer refunds for machines that could potentially put people at risk. There’s no legal obligation for it to do so, but Which? would like to see customers pushing strongly for this when the recall starts. Similarly, it says Whirlpool should reimburse any out-of-pocket expenses such as launderette bills, so keep receipts in case there’s a chance to claim.Whirlpool says: “We know just how important washing machines are, especially at this time of year, and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and concern this recall may cause.”We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

Please note that research has shown there to be other options at much lower price points, but they have not been considered by the provider.I think I will also invest some of my time investigating the possibility of remaining an EU dual national by descent as my mum’s family are Irish immigrants, but it’s OK because she voted Tory as she says, “We have too many immigrants in this country.”I might also look for a new, less xenophobic family.I am living and still working with metastatic lung cancer. I cannot get affordable travel insurance.

Several of the eastern EU countries have this – Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, for example.I have enough in the bank to afford to support myself in such a move, to set up a start-up or work for a firm over there.Whichever country I settle in, I intend to have a sideline recruiting highly skilled finance \u0026amp IT workers who are also looking for a quick route to EU citizenship. I expect this brain drain to really accelerate in 2020 during the transition period. The UK will become a goldmine for talent for smaller EU countries.Make sure I obtain Irish citizenship and then a passport ASAP.I had an Irish grandmother who left the Republic because she didn’t fancy a life of drudgery on the family farm. She watched part of the 1916 Rising across the street from the GPO (General Post Office, centre of the battle) and got shot at.Most importantly, I’m going to spend the year telling my European friends and colleagues that I love them and that Scotland needs them to stay.I’ve always wanted the UK to stay together but that is over so I’ll be campaigning for Indyref2 and a Yes vote. Finally, I’ll be making a special effort to be kind to folks. This is so important at this time. P.s. I’d also like to take a train journey on to the continent in late Mayearly June. No more flying.Writer and activist for Syria UKMy first trip to Europe was in 1963 – my brother and I went with our parents to Austria by train and it was the most exciting thing. I’ve never looked back and will continue to visit Europe as long as my health allows it.I love this country but now it feels mean and I feel like I’m wandering in a wasteland.My partner and I are going off in our camper van in January, we aren’t sure where we are going but we are getting out of here for a while, probably down to Spain and Portugal.Later in the year I hope to visit my cousin in Italy – she is English but has been married to an Italian doctor and has lived in Italy for 35 years and she is very sad to see us leaving and I am heart-broken too.Become a German. Odd? Not really – I have come to know Germans quite well and know that they are very open and generous people who can not understand why the Brits have gone off the rails so radically. None here understands why people in the UK are so radically opposed to working with the “Continent”.Lucy (name changed for confidentiality)Stay at home mum, 43Plan: Get IVF again in the EU at the same price.I’ve been offered a job in Germany working in customer service for Microsoft. I had never intended to take up an office job (all my previous jobs have been in tourism and involved being active). However, my priority is now leaving Britain for good.I have been making the most of freedom of movement since the age of 18: I have Interrailed and travelled extensively, studied at a French university, worked in France as a tour guide, worked as a holiday representative in Spain, worked in a hostel in Budapest.I’m using my last year of freedom of movement, as a British citizen at least, to become a legal resident of Germany and then hopefully one day regain the rights I am about to loose due to Brexit.Thanks to Brexit, I won’t be able to easily keep doing the seasonal work I love doing, because the likelihood of receiving a work permit as a non EU national is slim to none. I think it’s a great shame because I have lived, worked and studied in three other countries already at the age of 21, all without hassle due to freedom of movement. Boris’ intentions for Britain scare me and I feel no option but to leave the UK to secure a better future for myself.Plan: Get Irish citizenship (even though I have no Irish family connection)I shall be applying for Irish citizenship so I can retain all my rights as a European that have been taken away without so much as a please by the nut Brexiteers.Having lived here for nearly 20 years, it shouldn’t be a problem but, as someone with no familial Irish connection, it’s going to cost over €4,000 for the four of us in my family.However, it will be well worth it not to have to be part of the dysfunctional UK. Showing a blue British passport as you queue with all the other non-Europeans would be the last straw. I shall have a small passport burning ceremony if I’m successful.Plan: move to FranceWe will sell our house and try to persuade the French to let us live there.Plan: considering a move to FranceI am seriously considering moving to live in France together with my wife to join our daughter and eldest son (and seven of our 10 grandchildren) – both of whom moved to France some 20 years ago. However, we have a dilemma – our youngest son and his wife with their three young children live close by to us in North Wales and it would be a tremendously difficult decision to make.I have lived and worked in mainland Europe all of my working life – in Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. I was devastated and dismayed by the results of the general election and feel Brexit is the wrong thing to do – a big mistake – no one has ever given me any convincing argument or advantage for leaving the EU – no one ever will.Plan: Travel in EUPlan: tie the UK to EuropeBuy 100,000 kilometres of premium steel cable, 5m thick and tie Europe to our nation so as we never lose our close ties to Europe, as we are all Europeans.Acquire Dutch citizenship, at all costs. I have not lived in the UK since May 2003 and to have to return would be a personal tragedy. My life is here, I have no connection with the UK. I will never go to Britain of my own volition.Apart from this, we hope to start a collective of musicians and artists to challenge the destructive myths of our society. We live in a society whose dominant narratives, of human centrality on the Earth, social and technological progress, endless growth,the primacy of the inidual … these stories no longer have any basis in reality, and no longer equip us to deal with the political and ecological challenges of the new century.Thus, the next challenge, the most pertinent and urgent, must be to reinvent our cultural narratives to reflect our new situation. In the Netherlands we still have some hope that we can avoid our government being taken over by corporate-sponsored ethnic nationalists.To my fellow British-Europeans: I’m sorry for how things worked out for you. Don’t give up, but reevaluate, because a narrative which claims our current economic and political institutions can continue with minor progressive-oriented adjustments is no longer convincing, and will become less so as ecological and social disasters occur with ever greater frequency.Plan: get funding for an Erasmus period of study elsewhere in the EUI would like to pursue a postgraduate degree abroad, somewhere that is cheaper than in the UK. After three years of my undergraduate degree in Scotland, a place where an English-registered student still has to pay £9,000 a year, with classes bountiful with European students who pay less than I have for the same teaching and degree classification, I am looking for a bargain.Plan: move to another EU country, probably PortugalI’ve worked as an outdoor grower and harvest manager of an organic farm in Cornwall, I also team led Erasmus projects in Europe.I’m obviously very sad about the nation I can no longer be a part of I’m English in birth only.You may not be able to change the direction your country is moving in, but you can change your future. You don’t have to give up your rights, no one should be subjected to criminal abuse. Leave just as this nation has left its closest partners … it’s your life!Plan: looking forward to BrexitWe have three foreign daughters in law: one German, one Russian and one Australian with five grandchildren who have dual nationality so the outcome of the referendum has been looked at passionately over the past few years.We operate as a family within the need of a visa-required world and find it a little inconvenient but accept it for what it is: those countries’ rights to control their borders and refuse entry or pack off home anyone they see as a threat to their security or a threat to them from serious criminal activity, including one of the most liberal countries in the world, Australia!!!The biggest disaster to date was the introduction of the one size fits all euro, who says so? The very man whose idea it was in the first place, I wouldn’t argue with him as Im not qualified to do. He’s the professor of economics and recognised for it not me. I have carried out more reading on this one subject over the past four years than on any one single subject and therefore feel I take a balanced view. This whole circus pantomime played out right in front of our eyes and showed failings on all sides but was so intense it opened people’s eyes and I wasn’t surprised at the result of OUR general election.Plan: might move to NetherlandsI can’t stand to see the NHS fall apart under another Tory government, the stress of the job is too much even as a student and seeing my nursing colleagues struggle day after day unsafe staffing levels is too much.With leaving to Europe I need to get my skates on as my nursing degree may not be recognised and I will have to apply as a third country which involves a more complex, lengthy and expensive application process. Fingers crossed I can pass the Dutch language test and get on their nursing register before the Dec 2020 deadline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0487dad9315f52306b77b49ddab55b17e14e1aae/0_142_3058_1835/master/3058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df400887bcda8299f051a8908b4c6908","title":"rugby union talking points weekend premiership","story":"Willi Heinz is showing that Eddie Jones made the right call at the World Cup while there are encouraging signs at Welford RoadWilli Heinz was one of the more left-field selections in last year’s World Cup, called up by England at the age of 32 as one of two scrum-halves in their squad. The promotion of the New Zealander, who qualified through a grandmother, annoyed Danny Care, who for three years had appeared to be bound for Japan. Judging by the performances of the pair over the weekend, Eddie Jones not only made the right call but may be reluctant to jettison Heinz, who is now 33. The biggest single reason Gloucester came from behind to defeat Bath was Heinz’s ability to react to what he saw rather than read from a script. Gloucester are a curious mix of a side: on the one hand they make basic mistakes and creak in the set pieces but on the other they have the ability to make much from little, the likes of Heinz, Danny Cipriani and Mark Atkinson loading the gun for Ollie Thorley, Louis-Rees Zammit, Jason Woodward and Jake Polledri to fire. They are the Premiership’s wild cards. Paul ReesSuddenly Welford Road feels a more uplifting place. This was a second consecutive match at the grand old fortress of English rugby that might be accounted “good”. Better still, unlike the preceding example (a home defeat by Exeter), Leicester won it. It seems ridiculous, given their personnel, to note how well Leicester can play when the mood takes them. Whatever else happens, this will not be their last win of the season, even if the Six Nations looms into view to disrupt them, just as they find some form. Bristol, meanwhile, drop out of the top four to join a band of seven clubs frantically scrambling for the higher ground as the black tide rises angrily beneath them. None of them is safe – not even Leicester. Michael AylwinThe former Munster and Ireland coach Declan Kidney does not even want to hear the word relegation mentioned with his promoted side sitting third bottom of the Premiership table having picked up a solitary point in their three league games either side of Christmas. He favours a glass-half-full approach, suggesting attack remains the Exiles’ best form of defence as they seek to work their way up the table. Given they scored four tries against the league leaders he may have a point. If Irish can also get all their best players fit for the run-in, they will remain hopeful of recovering from their midwinter slump. “It’s the first half of games that we’re doing damage to ourselves,” suggested Kidney. That’s where we need to make ourselves better.” For the moment, though, Kidney must soldier on without his Irish internationals Paddy Jackson and Sean O’Brien, neither of whom is set to be available for several more weeks, and hope that the Wallaby lock Adam Coleman’s shoulder problem is not overly serious. Robert KitsonPaul Gustard’s arrival at Harlequins last season was meant to sort out their defence but the six-try thrashing at Sale took them to 12 conceded in the last three matches with strugglers Wasps and Leicester the first two opponents. Quins were narrow in Salford and bypassed all too often. The experience of Mike Brown is being missed at full-back and Sale have one of the strongest squads in the Premiership. Quins have a core of hardened international experience yet they have conceded at least 30 points in five league and Champions Cup matches this season. “We were not good enough and got beaten up,” said their director of rugby, Gustard, who took aim at his England prop Joe Marler for a loss of discipline at the start of the second half that cost him 10 minutes in the sin-bin. “It was ridiculous,” said Gustard about the prop putting his forearm in the face of an opponent. “There was no need for it.” It is not just Marler who needs to get a grip. PRThere was a lot to talk about for such a one-sided and eminently predictable match. First of all Michael Fatialofa. Rugby is familiar with the long pause in play while a stricken player is tended to, so we know the precautions need not mean serious injury. Alan Solomons’ openness afterwards, however, about how concerned he is gives us pause, as does the news that Fatialofa has been retained in hospital with his neck injury. Fingers remain crossed. Otherwise Saracens were content, in their bubble against an angry world, to celebrate the retirement of Nigel Wray in style. Ten tries – and it could have been more – is a statement in this league, whoever cops it. We now have the sight of a team with a points difference of plus 121 propping up the league. MAEvery point may well prove crucial in the bottom half of this season’s Premiership and Wasps will be gutted not to have clung on to victory against 13-man Northampton having taken the lead with 10 minutes remaining of a dramatic high-scoring game. Then again, they won right at the end in Bristol a week earlier and will also know that home improvement will be fundamental if they want to avoid being sucked down into the relegation morass in the coming months. Their next three away league games, against Worcester, Leicester and London Irish, will be equally telling: there are signs of improvement visible but two wins out of eight is clearly less than ideal. Saints, on the other hand, have won six out of eight and have scored more tries and points than any other side in the Premiership. They may have been found out by Leinster in Europe but team spirit is healthy and winning is becoming a habit. “We made it hard for ourselves but I’m massively proud of the boys,” said man of the match Teimana Harrison.

Curran sends a four square and that is that. South Africa will now have to make the highest score in Test history to win the game. England lead 421, 157 runs in the session. Sibley is applauded off the pitch for the best lunch of his lifetime.105th over: England 368-7 (Sibley 125, Curran 6) I’m not sure how they measure this but Maharaj is getting more turn over the wicket than around. At least I think that’s right, they whipped the stat away very quickly. Anyway, Curran flays him through the covers for four. Time, with lunch approaching, to chew over a declaration? Lead 414.104th over: England 362-7 (Sibley 124, Curran 1) Nortje sends down four byes high and getting higher over a ducking Sam Curran and then over the head of a leaping de Kock. Not a happy bowler. Stokes v Flintoff, take 2: Dylan Pugh.I think although they’re both obviously the premier pace allrounders of the time for England, their skillsets are very different.It boils down to the fact that Stokes is a world class bat who is a useful change bowler, whereas Flintoff was a world-class bowler, and a more than useful bat.You could make the argument that Freddie was the more naturally gifted of the two, but stokes ha a bigger hunger for runs. I’m not convinced Freddie would have always made the team as a bat, and Stokes has played more and more tests as a pure batsman.And take three: Avitaj Mitra.On the whole, I agree with Chris. Stokes for me, is still a batsman who bowls while when I think of Freddie, it is as someone who was a very reliable third choice bowler capable of the odd brilliant innings.Similarities between the two of course being that both have played starring roles in one Ashes series each.When I am asked to recall Stokes’ memorable performances, 2 or 3 immediately come to mind while for Freddie it was just the 2005 Ashes. (To be fair, what a sensational series that was)One thing we will never know however, is whether Stokes would have had the same effect that Freddie did, against “that” Aussie team of bonafide legends. My personal view is no.To conclude:Average Stokes \u0026gt Average Flintoff (without a doubt)Peak Flintoff \u0026gt Peak Stokes (but only just)Buttler tries to scoop but it was too short and the ball falls into the gloves of de Kock. Short but glorious.103rd over: England 356-6 (Sibley 123, Buttler 23) Sibley fine-edges Rabada for four and with that the England lead passes a stately 400. 102nd over: England 350-6 (Sibley 119, Buttler 23) Just the 14 from Nortje’s over as Buttler practises his stand and swivel. The sweetest hook for six, some pulls interspersed with a couple of drives. Despite what he said the other day, Buttler looks in very good nick indeed.Ok Flintoff v Stokes, take one: Will Padmore.In regards to Chris Goater’s question the bowling stats are actually very close. Flintoff has a lower bowling average (32.78 v 33.13) and better economy (2.97 v 3.34) but Stokes has more 5 wicket hauls (4 v 3) and a better strike rate (59.4 v 66.1). I’m not sure anyone would argue that Flintoff was a better batsman, I suspect it was telling that there was no real thought of him continuing as a batsman when bowling became so problematic.  I would also agree with Gough on the fitness point, I always felt that the shape Flintoff got himself in for the boxing match that he fought post retirement showed that he could have made more of an effort to look after himself more whilst playing (was he trying to emulate Beefy off the pitch as well as on?). Having said all of that being too young to have seen Botham in action, both Flintoff and Stokes are two of my all time favourites and have brought me much joy! 101st over: England 338-6 (Sibley 119, Buttler 9) Hey Jos, watch this! Sibley hauls himself down on one knee and sweeps Maharaj for SIX with casual violence. Next ball Maharaj fights back with an arm ball to get Sibley in a tangle, before Sibley responds with another sweep, this time for four. 100th over: England 327-6 (Sibley 109, Buttler 8) Nortje comes into the attack for the first time today and Buttler off-drives him for six! Like you do. Casually, in his tracksuit bottoms, skulking round the corner shop for a morning pick-me-up lucozade. 99th over: England 318-6 (Sibley 108, Buttler 1) Buttler and Sibley nurdle and nudge through Maharaj’s over. A timely stat from Sky - nine wickets fell on the first two days, six on the second, two today. A glimmer of hope for South Africa?My lovely colleague Tim de Lisle has sent me this of Sibley’s Warwickshire teammates. He’s a very popular chap. 98th over: England 316-6 (Sibley 107, Buttler 1) Sibley and Pope dab Rabada around before Pope drags on. Briefly, it all got a lot slower but, heck, what does it matter. Anyway, Buttler is in now. Both he and Stokes average in the mid 30s. But is unfair to expect much more giving firstly, where Buttler bats, and secondly, Stokes’s duties with the ball?Paul Hand sums up Sibley simply, but perfectly, all the way from KazakhstanIMO a selfless and for the team innings. A good rest for the bowlers.England are almost in an unassailable position.Thanks Dom. Rabada comes wide of the wicket and Pope rocks back and gets an inside edge, plop, onto his stumps. 97th over: England 313-5 (Sibley 106, Pope 1) What an innings that was from Ben Stokes. Do catch the highlights later if you can. To be honest, the whole innings was a highlights package. The perfect combination of gay abandon and absolute skill. Plus he got Sibley safely to his hundred and England into a place of complete supremacy - lead currently 359. Ollie Pope gets off the mark with a reverse sweep off Maharaj. Ian Forth is a happy man too.Cape Town is an even more perfect timezone for expats following England from Australia. A tough day on the corporate coalface (incorporating a little snooze early afternoon in the car park) then the evening slot from 7.30 through to 3 am. Hopefully no one notices if you’re not operating on all four cylinders the first week in January.I thought you lot had most of January off?Maharaj gets his man at last. Stokes gets down on one knee, but doesn’t quite get the distance this time and the balls falls to van der Dussen at long on, who takes a more than decent catch, sliding down onto his ankles. Stokes walks off with the broadest of smiles. Just 47 balls, and a whole heap of joy. 96th over: England 310-4 (Sibley 105, Stokes 72) South Africa have spread the field, a field of du Plessis’s nightmares. There is one slip and eight men on the boundary. And that’s a partnership of 100 runs in 92 balls. On Talk Sport Goughy has just said that he rates Stokes higher than Flintoff, partially because he thinks Flintoff was rarely fit enough to make the most of his talent. It is an interesting question. I don’t think there is much doubt that Stokes is a better batsman. But as a bowler, he is nowhere near as good as Freddy, in my opinion. Flintoff’s ability to bowl reverse, and especially his angle to left-handers, made him a much more genuine allrounder, in my opinion. But what does the wisdom of the OBO crowd think?95th over: England 307-4 (Sibley 104, Stokes 70) Memories flooding back of Stokes’s double hundred he gathered four years ago as he clobbers Maharaj with a wide-legged reverse sweep, a smash through mid-wicket and a stick-that-up-your-jumper casual six. Brutal. 94th over: England 294-4 (Sibley 104, Stokes 55) Three off Rabada, and that’s drinks and the morning has gone better than England could have dreamt. South Africa, ye gods, have not had such a good morning. A special mention here to all those county cricket readers who have been championing Sibley for two or three years, and to him for churning out those hundreds for Warwickshire - it is his Championship performances that got him picked for England, no hunch, no admiration of his Vince-like flair. 93rd over: England 289-4 (Sibley 103, Stokes 54) Yes! Sibley sweeps Maharaj for four - such panache! He pumps the air, pulls off his helmet to reveal the broadest of smiles, gets a big hug from Ben Stokes, kisses the badge, and on the balcony everyone is standing and smiling, Sam Curran leaps in the air. What a cracking innings, playing to his strengths, doing it for the team. From Surrey to Warwickshire to England - here’s to many , many more. The first century of the series too.92nd over: England 282-4 (Sibley 99, Stokes 50) And that’s the Ben Stokes 50 with a touch behind square and the Dom Sibley 99 as he edges Rabada, not completely convincingly, down to the boundary and on the England balcony everyone is smiling. Come on Dom!A lovely email from David Murray. What a morning! An England win in prospect and suddenly 3 or 4 choices for the-future-of-England cricket (Sibley, Pope, Crawley, Burns).Newlands is in the perfect timezone for following OBO back in the UK - none of this awful waiting around until 11.00am or staying up all night. Something to look forward to as soon as you switch on your computer.It’s a perfect timezone for OBO-ing too!90th over: England 277-4 (Sibley 95, Stokes 49) Stokes is seeing the new ball like a new year’s resolution he needs to finish off, he reverse-sweeps Maharaj with such quick, loose hands. It is Jack Spratt and his Mrs Spratt out there in the middle for England but, oh, such a perfect combination. Especially with all the Christmas leftovers to finish off.89th over: England 272-4 (Sibley 94, Stokes 45) Oh dear, nothing going for South Africa this morning. Stokes pulls Rabada high and a sprinting de Koch calls for it, he must cover 50 yards sprinting down towards fine leg, but then muffs the (difficult) chance. Stokes rubs salt into the wound by rocking back onto his heels, rolling his wrists and slamming a juicy full toss back over the boundary next ball. And that’s the fifty partnership of which Stokes has scored 45! And now Sibley gets in on the act with a nicely played boundary through the covers.Still in the bunker....Following OBO for a little second-hand sunlight...What are the odds on Stokes getting to a ton before Sibley....It’s certainly possible... especially if South Africa keep sending down these fat, juicy, easy pickings.88th over: England 261-4 (Sibley 90, Stokes 38 ) Sibley enters the 90s with a prosaic two off Maharaj into the leg side. It takes some mental strength to just plod away while a cartoon hero throws the bat at the other end.Michael Anderson, you’re my hero Re John Starbuck’s question 80th over, I took it upon myself to have a look through Root’s declaration history as England captain. In 36 matches before this one he has declared nine times, winning six, drawing two, and losing that one against Shai Hope at Headingley in 2017. Don’t know how this compares to other captains, but if it helps, of the six wins, the margins have been 211, 232, 239, innings and 119, innings and 159, innings and 209, so all quite safe.Whilst looking through, I noticed that our second innings total is often larger than our first. The total aggregate of runs doesn’t help much because we don’t always bat twice, but looking at our average runs per wicket since Root became captain: in first innings is 29.14, and in second innings 29.72. Ok pretty much identical. But surely there can’t be many teams who average more in second innings that first?87th over: England 259-4 (Sibley 88, Stokes 38 ) Philander trundels in and for no apparent reason turns carthorse as Stokes climbs into his farmyard galoshes and throws the bat for fours through backward point and square leg and runs any old place his can slam them. The England lead passes 300.86th over: England 247-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 27) Maharaj is kept on with the new ball. Sibley almost in trouble from one round the wicket that spins past the outside of his prodding bat. He looks a little leaden footed, but survives. It’s dusty out there.85th over: England 246-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 26) And we have the new ball at last, after that expensive experiment, in the rightful mitts of Vernon Philander bowling from the Wynberg end to restore some order. Sibley with that dot-to-dot stubble perfection prods the pitch to see out a maiden. Norje, incidentally, is back on the pitch. Tom! Tom! I hope you’re still reading... a message to cheer up your Monday:Morning, Michael Robinson.First Monday back today and it’s already a struggle. Cheers for providing some OBO respite.Can I just say that the 22222.22 stat you posted earlier is hands down the best email input I’ve ever seen to OBO. Excellent stuff.84th over: England 246-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 26) Just a massive Stokes six, down on one knee, thanks very much, straight bat, straight legs, gorgeous. Maharaj get the better of him later in the over when a ball spins out of a huge puff of dust - more good news for England. 83rd over: England 236-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 16) That could be the end of the no ball. Ben Stokes decides to get his eye in by destroying Pretorius’s morning confidence with a six farted straight back whence it came, followed by a reverse switch for four. He’s got the bit between his teeth this morning, don’t go anywhere.82nd over: England 223-4 (Sibley 85, Stokes 5) A disdainful swat from Ben Stokes dispatches Pretorius for the first boundary of the day. Still with the old ball here, apparently Anrich Nortje is not on the field, sick. An email pops up from Tom Bowtell entitled “exciting Philander Stat.”Morning Tanya! It’s going to be a hugely tense day for stats lovers. A glance at Philander’s current career stats shows he has 222 wickets at 22.05. However, if he concedes another 32 runs without taking a wicket, he’ll momentarily have the holy grail career figures of 222 wickets at 22.22. There is so much that can go wrong: a wicket with the new ball, a selfish slog from a batter which skips the average from 22.21 to 22.23, there are even rumours he isn’t fit, so he might not even bowl enough overs to concede the runs.All we can do is watch and hope. 81st over: England 219-4 (Sibley 85, Stokes 1) Ok, so that wasn’t the last over with the old ball. du Plessis gives Maharaj a go from the other end. It was nearly a seven ball over actually as the umpire lost count of how many balls Maharaj had bowled. Not sure if they still transfer pebbles from hand to hand to count the over out. Just a single to Stokes with a sweep behind square80th over: England 218-4 (Sibley 85, Stokes 0) Dwaine Pretorius bowls a last over with the old ball, Dom Sibley is watchful. A maiden. A few hazy clouds float above Table Mountain but the sky is blue and the temperature a blissful 22 degrees. John Starbuck has been musing in Yorkshire:Good morning, Tanya, from windswept Yorkshire. As a matter of curiosity, are there any stats on Root’s declarationwin history? And how do they compare with other England captains?Who do you think I am, Rob Smyth? If Rob happens to be reading he’s probably got those stats in his morning milk jug. If not, I promise to try and research at drinks. The players are on their way out, Dom Sibley has a new batting partner in Ben Stokes. Whilst it was refreshing to see Dom Sibley’s long drawn out openers innings, I hear time and time again that it is the duty of the openers to take the ‘bite’ out of the new ball and allow the lower order batsman to get their eye in with a scuffed cherry that has less zip to it. Therefore would it have not been better had Sibley given away his wicket 10 overs ago?Unless an opener carries his bat, what is the ideal time they should spend at the crease?I’m not sure if there is an ideal time, it would all depend on game circumstances, pitch, weather etc etc. But I think in this England line-up which has such a propensity for collapsing, but such an abundance of stroke-players, actually staying in at one end and scoring, however slowly, gives the others the freedom to play their own game.Interesting interview with Graham Thorpe, England’s batting coach . He talks about the simplicity of Dom Sibley’s technique. Says he said to him, there’s time to talk about the areas of where to develop your game but when you’re in the heat of the battle keep doing what you do. Important to work on his technique outside off stump but without getting into his head too much.Vic Marks was on the radio this morning and saying that this is the first time England have ever played four players under 23 in the same match. I’m not doubting Vic’s stats, but can this really be true?Anyway, it looks a beautiful day at Newlands. Shaun Pollock is in a suit and Mike Atherton and Ian Ward are in shirt sleeves. Ward’s hand is in his pocket, of course. The only other person I’ve noticed with such a pocket obsession is Aussie PM Scott Morrison. Apparently whereas in England you need overcast conditions to move the ball about, in South Africa the heat bakes the pitch a bit and the edges come up and it jags around. That’s the science bit. South Africa have this morning to try and keep in the game with the new ball.And Sachin Tendulkar follows where Virat Kohli dared to tread:“Spinners look forward to bowling with the scruffed ball, taking advantage on day five of the roughs created on the wickets.” “All that is part of Test cricket. Is it fair to take that advantage away from spinners? There is T20, there is one-dayers and then there are T10 and 100-ball cricket. Test is the purest form of cricket. It SHOULD NOT BE TINKERED WITH.”Nice gesture here by Shane Warne:It’s all over at the SCG. Another century for David Warner, five wickets for Nathan Lyon and, as crackle follows snap, Australia claimed all five Tests of the summer inside four days for the first time. Good morning! It’s all a bit back-to-work-Monday here in the UK, but over in Cape Town England have been busy putting in the hard yards all weekend thanks very much. Dom Sibley, England’s answer to Desperate Dan, has, in between lunging awkwardly and munching cow pie, done what England’s team of cavaliers has been desperate for someone to do: score slow (his first 50 runs took 50 overs), boring, unremarkable and steady runs. In the words of James Anderson “That’s what we’ve been missing for a couple of years. Hopefully he’s going to cement his place and will get confidence from this knock and go on tomorrow. More importantly, hopefully he can go on in his career in the next few years.”Sibley will start tomorrow just 15 short of a century, with the middle-order guns for company. By mid-morning drinks he should be nearly there - the perfect morale booster for the rest of the tour and just what England need with his opening partner Rory Burns now likely to be nursing his ankle and off cricket for the rest of the winter. Of course there’s always the possibility that England will pull out of their classic collapses - South Africa lost their last 7 wickets for 66 after all. But with a lead of 264 already, and a change in the wind direction to help the fast bowlers, another 50-100 runs and they’ll be safe. Safeish. Pretty safe. Let’s settle on safe enough.

So why is he staging the great Aids epic Angels in America? Apparently, it’s all a misunderstandingArnaud Desplechin looks surprisingly calm as he excuses himself to listen to a voicemail from the Comédie-Française’s technical team. France is one week into a general strike over pension reform and the country’s premier theatre company has followed suit, resulting in cancelled performances and rehearsals. “We take it day by day,” says Desplechin, whose new production of Angels in America is due to open in mid-January. “It will start to get difficult if it continues.” We spoke in December and the strike is still going strong, but there is no plan to delay.It doesn’t help that Tony Kushner’s sprawling 1990s play about the Aids crisis is only Desplechin’s second theatre project, his first being a 2015 version of August Strindberg’s Father. The 59-year-old auteur is renowned for such character-driven screen dramas as Kings and Queen and My Golden Days, which often draw on his own life and background. Yet this month he will be in two Paris theatres at once, since an adaptation of his film A Christmas Tale is appearing at the Odéon-Théâtre de l’Europe.It’s an unlikely development for a film director who never pined for the stage. “I always told myself I would never do theatre,” he says. “For me, it was for bourgeois, adult people, while I was making cinema, the art of rascals.” Father, he says sheepishly, came out of a “misunderstanding”. Eric Ruf, the Comédie-Française’s director, had a small part in My Golden Days, and one morning asked Desplechin if he would direct a production for the company, 10 minutes before filming was due to start. “I said, ‘Yes, of course.’ But if he’d asked me to run around the block in my underwear, I would have done it – anything so the actor is good.”Ruf took him at his word and the result was Father. Angels in America is a more ambitious undertaking. Desplechin says the company was “terrified” when he proposed more than 40 set changes: the Comédie-Française is a repertoire theatre, so productions must rotate from one day to the next, and come with a strict three-hour time limit. To make it work, Ruf, an experienced set designer himself, provided support and extra rehearsal time on the stage of the Salle Richelieu, the company’s historical home, not far from the Louvre.Desplechin, who is focusing on the romantic relationships between the mostly gay characters, admits to some trepidation, not being a member of the LGBTQ+ community. “I felt it was missing from my work,” he says. “I think that some heterosexual love stories have the privilege of being universal, while there is something singular about a gay story. So how do you make sure everyone in the audience is moved? Am I capable of it?” Like fellow film-maker Christophe Honoré – who crafted an impressive play, Les Idoles, about the toll the Aids crisis took on the French intellectual scene – Desplechin lost some of his artistic heroes to the illness, and vividly remembers the pervading sense of “terror”.When discussing his theatre work, the soft-spoken French director seems in awe of his Comédie-Française cast. “There is a technical knowledge that I don’t have. I feel very lucky to be a student. If my actors are happy, if they think I haven’t said anything stupid, then it’s fine.”A different side of Desplechin comes out when the conversation turns to cinema, his childhood love. “On film sets, I like to be the king,” he says. “I’m a despot. When I need to go to the bathroom, everyone shouts, ‘The king is going to the bathroom’ – because it takes three minutes and everything is organised around me. I love it.”Not even, I ask, when he was sued, unsuccessfully, by his former partner Marianne Denicourt, who claimed in her 2005 book Evil Genius that Desplechin had lifted painful episodes from her personal life without permission to write Kings and Queen? Desplechin appears unconcerned: “Of my films, it’s the one that performed best at the box office, what can I tell you?”The rest of his family, he adds, has learned to live with it. “You know what they say: there is no worse curse than to have a child who is a writer. If you’re Kafka’s father, you’re not going to be very pleased.” Does Desplechin hope his own son won’t turn to writing? He laughs. “Look how much of a masochist I am. Of course I hope he’ll be Kafka! As long as I’m good material for him.”Desplechin seems genuinely happy to take a back seat for his Angels in America – “I’m here to serve Kushner, that’s it” – and to see A Christmas Tale reinvented for the stage. Don’t expect him to write a play any time soon, however. “I feel like you need a lifetime of theatre experience to do that. Films are much easier: anyone can do it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d21180d991f1f7e8cd72beda5466453ced3f4b/0_79_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95096e855b9e7ca57112e357fb13da1e","title":"20 new uk attractions visit 2020 adventure parks wellbeing theatres museums","story":"The coming year will see a bumper crop of openings and relaunches, including adventure parks, wellbeing centres, theatres and museumsThe 450-hectare Rye Harbour nature reserve, with its coastal habitats of grassland, saltmarsh, and sand and shingle shoreline, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year with a new visitor centre opening in association with Sussex Wildlife Trust.

Grabar-Kitarović’s loss was seen as a heavy blow.Political analyst Tihomir Cipek said the result would weaken the HDZ party and harm Plenković’s reputation, The prime minister is also facing the discontent of hardliners within the HDZ over his moderate policies.Grabar-Kitarović presented herself as a “woman of the people” with humble farming roots. She is well known for stunts such as singing in public, which her critics deride as embarrassing.She also came under fire for downplaying the crimes committed by Croatia’s second world war pro-Nazi regime.Milanović, who was prime minister from 2011 to 2016 and whose government failed to push through much-needed reforms, was seeking to make a political comeback and throw off a reputation as arrogant and elitist.He will now take office during a Croatian EU presidency in which four main issues are likely to dominate: the bloc’s relationship with the UK after Brexit the membership bids of Western Balkan states climate change and the bloc’s budget framework for the next decade.Croatia joined the EU in 2013, but its economy, strongly relying on tourism, remains one of the bloc’s weakest. The EU’s open borders have accelerated the exodus of its people, seeking better pay in wealthier member states.Many emigrants also cite corruption, nepotism and poor public services as reasons for leaving.“Politicians are wrangling about the past and insignificant issues while my generation is leaving,” said Maja Marić, a 20-year-old economics student. She said she voted for a “lesser evil”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131035.1578243573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"central bank s jackpot of almost 350m for public to claim","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEighteen years after the Irish punt ceased to be legal tender, a total of €347,404,127 in notes and coins still remains unaccounted for.

But these remarkable pictures were taken not on a Hollywood set, but 140 years ago on the streets of London, among the Victorian capital’s itinerant workers.Only now has colour been added to them by a specialist craftsman, with the intention of bringing the images to life for a modern audience.The photographs of Victorian street life among the poor and low paid were taken during the mid-1870s by the Edinburgh born photographer John Thomson, whose work chronicling ordinary life around him is now regarded as having paved the way for modern photo-journalism.Thomson teamed up with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith and together they produced a monthly magazine called Street Life In London in which they explored the lives, language and daily habits of London’s street vendors, canal workers, buskers and labourers.In a sign of how the capital has long been a magnet for migrant workers and their families, one of the most vivid photographs taken by Thomson shows a group of Italian street musicians, who Smith described as “sons of peasants, agricultural labourers, and others who might lead respectable lives in their own country”.He explained why such people might be drawn to our shores - in language that might be applicable to today’s migrants.A mother with a babe in arms and an older child survey the goods being sold by a ‘swag’ man or barrow boy“They find that a beggar in England is richer than a labourer in Italy,” wrote Smith in his accompaniment to Thomson’s photographs. “The Italian therefore migrates with the knowledge that he may rely on the generosity of the English, and if he only receives as much as many of the English poor, he may hope to save enough to buy himself a farm in his own country.”Among Thomson and Smith’s subjects was even a street doctor, who dispensed cough lozenges and healing ointments to those who could not afford the services of a qualified medic.One of the most striking photographs is that of a woman with a babe in arms and an older child surveying the goods being sold by a ‘swag’ man or barrow boy.The bearded street vendor bemoans the decline in his trade, telling Smith: “There are now too many ‘swags’ and most of them ain’t the gentleman they used to be. I should say there are 1,500 ‘swag’ dealers about London, counting women, boys and girls.”But the stall’s owner comforts himself with the thought he’ll always find customers among the capital’s women, ever mindful of their appearance, no matter how poor.“The profits are much lower at present. But bad as times be, it’s wonderful how women will have ornaments. I have had them come with their youngsters without shoes or stockings, and spend money on ear-drops, or a fancy comb for the hair.”Like Dickens, Thomson and Smith were keenly aware of the dire social conditions in which London’s street workers lived. Smith wrote of the capital’s watermen - who he called “workers on the silent highway - that “it is difficult for them to secure education for their children, and regular attendance at school would be impossible unless the child left its parents altogether.”The photographs have been colourised for the modern eye by Tom Marshall, who has also applied a similar treatment to photographs of soldiers in the trenches during the First World War.Marshall, who spent weeks colourising Thompson’s original black and white photographs, told The : “I believe that colourising images can allow a modern audience to engage better with the subject, especially in an age where we see thousands of images on a news feed every day.“Colour brings out hidden details which are often lost in black and white, and it causes the viewer to pause and look. That’s not to say that the original images are not fascinating in their own right, but I believe that the addition of colour helps to enhance the scene and forces the viewer to spend more time looking into it, and reading the accompanying caption.”Furniture sellers in Victorian LondonThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueI remember feeling nonplussed by the whole thing. What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The demographic\u0026nbsptimebomb is well known — even if no one has adequately dealt with it — and the vast global debt burden of $188 trillion (£143 trillion) is unlikely to be an issue this year as low as interest rates remain low, as most forecasters expect.But deglobalisation is proving to be a major threat to the global economy. Societe\u0026nbspGenerale\u0026nbsp(Soc Gen) has warned that financial globalisation is at a “tipping point”, highlighting the possibility of stagnation and even a slow decline in production links between economies.‘Alarm bells ring’ as factory output falls at fastest rate in 7 yearsSoc Gen, which forecasts global growth slowing from 3.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2020 and 2021, says financial globalisation has slowed significantly. Annual cross-border capital flows have decreased by more than 60 per cent compared to the peak in 2007.There is a similar problem with the trade in goods.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gambling companies pay referral fees to intermediaries who can find new customers that may turn into lucrative regular players.Online gambling group 888 takes £15m punt on BetBrightTom Watson labels problem gambling as a ‘public health emergency’Will bookies millions to address problem gambling buy off critics?This week, the extent to which gambling companies’ multibillion-pound profits rely on problem gamblers was revealed in a report obtained , which showed that one firm collected 83 per cent of its deposits from just 2 per cent of its customers.A Google spokesperson said: “We support responsible gambling advertising and it’s important to us that people see useful and relevant ads in this area.\u0026nbsp“As such, we have strict policies around gambling ads, which we enforce rigorously. We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Undergraduates aged between 18 and 19 are 25 per cent less likely to be in work than they were in the early 2000s.\u0026nbspMs Gardiner added: “With young people today expected to end their working lives at a later age than previous generations, it\u0027s understandable that they want to start their working lives at a later age too.“But this lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones like motherhood or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”.

Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. Another verse includes the lyrics: “You never cared about grime, you just used it  Worse than Ed with your watered down music.”Stormzy is yet to respond to the diss track, but in a recent interview he likened Wiley to a “drunk uncle” who should “get back to bed”.Wiley, hailed by many as the “godfather of grime”, has taken aim at a number of fellow rappers over the years, including AJ Tracey who he recently mocked for his hit “Ladbroke Grove”, which is a nod to old-school garage music.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He designed it, built it then realised it was far too savage and bitey to live in, say, Milton Keynes.Or the poisonous redback spider which likes to hide under lavatory seats so it can bite a man’s penis when he sits down to do his number twos. No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area. Pity.Many of the kids were explaining how they’d given up meat to save the planet and that Greta Thunberg may be Mrs Jesus.But then, instead of actually going walking, they stayed in the car, running its V diesel engine to keep warm.I WAS asked the other dayI’d be starting the year by doing Veganuary.FINALLY, may I wish everyone a very happy New Year.And extend a big thank you to Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for making such a thing likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it had to act rapidly.Iranian reprisals may be inevitable.But standing back hasn’t done the West much good.The mullahs at least now need to factor in a US President who’s more ruthless than the last.Three days ago Ayatollah Khamenei taunted him over the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad. “You can’t do anything,” he sneered.Trump’s put him straight there.  WHAT is this spell Labour’s Jess Phillips casts over Blairites and media pundits  We don’t get it.We do not doubt her hard work, nor that her heart is in the right place.Many naively believe her Brummie accent makes her the true voice of the working-class — this middle-class, grammar-schooled daughter of an NHS executive and a teacher.But that’s not our real beef. It’s the toe-curling, overwrought Commons monologues designed for social media.And the needlessly vitriolic and hysterical Twitter rants.Consider this gem: “The greatest lie ever told is that Boris is likeable, with cut-through outside ­London.” That aged well, as they say.Phillips may yet be Labour’s best hope as leader, God help them.But to be seen as a serious politician, she should start acting like one. IT is obvious the teenager convicted of lying about her gang-rape in Cyprus signed a bogus dictated confession under duress.Its dodgy English smacks of a foreign cop, not an articulate young Brit.The Foreign Office must act.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So its announcement tonight that it will no longer keep up it end of the bargain comes as no surprise.Abutorabi said: “We can attack the White House itself, we can respond to them on the American soil. We have the power, and God willing we will respond in an appropriate time.“When someone declares war do you want to respond to the bullets with flowers  They will shoot you in the head.”The comments came after Trump issued a stark warning to Iran threatening to hit dozens of targets in the Islamic Republic “very fast and very hard”it retaliates for the targeted killing of Soleimani.And Iranian state TV also announced there has been an million bounty put on Trumps head.Trump tweeted that his administration had already targeted  Iranian sites, “some at a very high level  important to Iran  the Iranian culture.”Trump later blasted: The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment.  We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World!If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautul equipment their way...and without hesitation!However, Irans army chief said Washington lacked the guts to go to war with his forces.I doubt they have the courage to initiate, said Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are leaving. We will have left the EU.” The shadow Brexit Secretary said that Labour’s election defeat “blew away” the argument for a second referendum and that the debate would now move on to Britain’s future relationship with Brussels.  As he confirmed he was entering the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn, he said: “We need to focus on what comes next. Picking over the last manesto is not the job in hand. The job in hand is to write and start writing that  manesto.” Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee will meet in London on Monday to set the timetable for the contest, which is expected to formally start on Tuesday. The NEC will also set the deadline for those signing up to vote in the contest as well as the cost of becoming a registered supporter - non-party members who can vote in the race. Five candidates have already announced their leadership bids - Mr Starmer, Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy, Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis.  Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, seen as the continuity Corbyn candidate, is expected to confirm she is running later this week. She will stand for leader on a joint ticket with her close friend Angela Rayner as deputy, with the flatmates understood to be sharing a policy .     Ms Rayner, the favourite to take over from Tom Watson as deputy, will launch her campaign on Monday on the council estate in Stockport where she grew up.  The new leader is expected to be in place by the end of March. Ms Phillips opened up a Brexit ide with Mr Starmer, who a poll of members suggested was the early favourite, suggesting she was prepared to push to rejoin the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"labour calls democratic reform news","story":"NewsLabour calls for democratic reform of news broadcasters over bias claimsEXCLUSIVE Labours Andy McDonald said broadcasters dubbing the race the Brexit Election played into Boris Johnsons campaign strategy - and \"biased\" media coverage \"undermines our democratic process.\"ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAndy McDonald says media coverage played a part in Labours defeat \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mr McDonald claimed: “It was a political choice for broadcasters to use ‘the Brexit election’ rather than, say, ‘the NHS election’, and it gave the Tories a clear advantage over Labour.” The Tories have also attacked the media with Mr Johnson refusing to appear on leadersapos debates on Sky and Channel  during the election campaign, ministers boycotting BBC Radio aposs Today programme and the Mirror being banned from the Tory election bus. This week newspaper bosses hit out a Downing Street for trying to seize control of crucial daily press briefings.  The briefings, usually held in the House of Commons, where journalists are based, will be moved to Number  Downing Street - where the Government have more control on which journalists can attend. Jeremy Corbyn has previously called for a broad discussion on democratisation of the media.Among his suggestions, outlined in a  speech, were the election of some BBC board members by staff and licence fee payers, and the reduction or removal of the government’s powers of appointment. And he suggested placing the BBC on a permanent statutory footing to end government control through charter renewal.

They have destroyed and demonised Labour leaders from time immemorial. But they pulled out all the stops with Jeremy, turning a kind, principled man who cares passionately about ending inequality and injustice, into the devil incarnate. I’ve never seen an inidual so vilied and, given this, it’s astonishing that more people actually voted for Jeremy, both in this election and in , than Ed Miliband in , Gordon Brown in , or Tony Blair in . But while the Tory-backing press barons aren’t new, what’s changed in this election is the way TV and radio have joined in with that battle. On Radio , I argued that the BBC did not conduct themselves in an impartial manner during this election but I failed to mention the other broadcasters, who are equally guilty. The morning after the election, one of my Shadow Cabinet colleagues, Dan Carden, was accused by a Sky News anchor of “blaming Brexit” for Labour’s defeat. Dan laughed and pointed to the coffee table they were sitting at, which had “the Brexit election” stamped on it in huge letters. For six weeks the broadcasters dubbed this “the Brexit election”, consciously playing into Boris Johnson’s core campaign message that this election was about Brexit and that only he could “get Brexit done”. Then, after the results, the very same broadcast journalists claimed the election wasn’t about Brexit. You couldn’t make it up.The reality is, on TV Brexit was reported on twice as much as the economy and they covered the NHS even less. And on other crucial issues from climate change, education and public services, to my area, transport, there was a fraction of the airtime , despite these issues affecting the vast majority of people in our country as well as, you know, the future of our planet and all humankind.It was a political choice for broadcasters to use ‘the Brexit election’ rather than, say, ‘the NHS election’, and it gave the Tories a clear advantage over Labour. There were countless other examples of bias from broadcasters. Remember the moment when the Conservatives’ spokesperson told the press he had been punched by a pro-Labour activist  Broadcast journalists reported it without bothering to check with Labour, and were forced to delete their tweets and apologise when the footage emerged proving it was a Tory lie to distract from Boris Johnson’s refusal to look at an image of a sick child on a hospital floor. On polling day one TV journalist predicted that Johnson would win the majority “he so deserves”, and another said that postal votes were looking “grim” for Labour ten hours before the close of polls, which the Electoral Commission has warned may be a breach of the law. They painted the Tories as the ones to be taken seriously, and Labour as flighty and unreliable, even though Labour’s comprehensive and detailed plans are fully costed, while the Tories’ manesto presented no solutions to the deep social, economic and environmental problems facing our country.  According to one broadcast journalist, while the Conservatives proposed a “shopping list of promises”, Labour’s plans were merely “an encyclopedia of ambitions”. Such distortions in favour of the Conservatives included the BBC replacing footage of Johnson laying his wreath upside down on Remembrance Sunday with old footage of him correctly laying a wreath a previous year. If Jeremy had done this it would have been headline news, not airbrushed out of history. The newspapersapos agenda largely drives that of the broadcasters. These news values are outdated when most people donapost get their news from print papers, and, more signicantly, this overwhelmingly privileges the interests of billionaires and the Conservative Party they support. So is it any wonder that whatever ridiculous attack the Sun was peddling on Jeremy or the Labour Party on a particular day it was reported prominently on TV and radio, whereas revelations about Boris Johnson’s previously unreported sexist, homophobic, racist, Islamophobic, antisemitic comments and his attacks on single mothers and working class people, were generally deemed insufficiently newsworthy.  Panels and paper reviews were also largely full of anti-socialist pundits, when there are plenty who offer an alternative view. The Muslim Council of Britain also formally complained about the lack of coverage of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, which was played down by broadcast correspondents as merely involving “some instances”, despite polling showing the majority of Conservative members hold Islamophobic views. One broadcast journalist even said antisemitism in Labour is “of a dferent order” to Islamophobia in the Conservatives, suggesting that the former is more signicant than the latter. Both are despicable and both should be scrutinised and fought across the political spectrum and across our society. Analysis shows that push notications sent out by the press were overwhelmingly anti-Labour, and softer on the Tories.This isn’t just the case for the newspaper’s apps, but for BBC and Sky’s too.And when a former Labour MP and Conservative government appointee , who probably over % of the country have never heard of was the th most prominent figure in media coverage during the election, you know the world has gone topsy turvy.While his attacks on Jeremy and Labour received copious airtime, John Major and Michael Heseltine, former Tory Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, who criticised their party, were covered far less.

A study of , UK adults, whoaposve holidayed in the last year, found they spend  hours over a seven-day holiday - the equivalent of am until :pm - wasting time. The average holiday-goer spends nearly an hour a day venturing between their accommodation and sights,  minutes choosing what to do and researching places to eat, and nearly a quarter of an hour worrying about work. However, they still manage to squeeze in a -minute nap, nearly an hour and  minutes is dedicated to activities and sightseeing, and just over an hour a day is spent properly relaxing.  you donapost plan ahead, you might find yourself wasting your time away and not truly enjoying your break  Graham Donoghue, chief executive of Sykes Holiday Cottages, which commissioned the study, said: Thereaposs now so much choice when it comes to accommodation and activities that,you donapost plan ahead, you might find yourself wasting your time away and not truly enjoying your break. A little time spent researching restaurants in advance and deciding what to do can make a big dference to your holiday. Itaposs really worth it when you think about how easy it is to find recommendations and make bookings online. The study also found that, despite spending more than an hour a day going for walks,  per cent of travellers would like to enjoy more of this during a break away. And regardless of a similar amount of time spent eating out, two-fths would like to devote more of their vacation hours indulging in delicious restaurant dishes.  A quarter of holidaymakers think they squander too much time deciding what to do, and the same amount reckon they spend more time doing what others want - than what theyaposd prefer themselves. As a result,  per cent have argued with people theyaposve holidayed with over plans for the trip ahead. In fact, before the break has even begun, adults say they spend two and half hours planning their break, with a third thinking planning is key to having a successful holiday. However, working long hours, looking after children and getting chores done at home are among the barriers to holiday-goers being able to plan in advance. More than one in  will even expect someone  to take the reins, while nearly a fth leave things to the last minute when itaposs often too late to make any advance plans.

Instead it is targeting flexitarians who want to cut down on their meat consumption, with Burger King marketing director Katie Evans describing the new menu addition as a game changer  just in time for Veganuary. This really is a game changer - we wanted our first plant-based Whopper to replicate the indulgence and flame-grilled taste of the real thing as closely as possible, and weaposre thrilled with the result, she said.Weaposre delighted to satisfy the demand for this highly-anticipated product and finally bring the Rebel to the UK.

The cause of his death is unknown and Rachel and the coupleaposs two sons Daniel,  and Joseph, , are waiting for post-mortem results, the Liverpool Echo reported.  Rachel, of Garston, Merseyside, who works as a mental health nurse, said in a touching tribute to her husband, that Dave was a a man who tackled everything with a smile. She said: He was loving, kind and funny. There wasnapost a day that went by when he didnapost laugh, even with everything that was going on. We were like a tag team. I can count on one hand how many times we argued. We never fell out, it was a textbook marriage. It was everybodyaposs dream marriage. On the day she found that Dave had collapsed at home, Rachel said she went into nurse mode, having only completed a refresher course in immediate le support the week before. She said: When I came into the living room I thought he was having a fit, heaposd collapsed on the sofa. I picked up the phone and rang  and then I opened the front door so they could get in when they arrived. I started doing CPR on him and then when the paramedics came they took over. They worked on him for about  minutes, they were just amazing. By the time we got to hospital I knew he wasnapost going to come back because I work in brain injury rehabilitation. Back in , Dave was diagnosed with a rare form of muscular dystrophy which affected his ability to walk and resulted in him having to wear ankle supports to keep his limbs in the right position.  The -year-old, who worked as a light and sound engineer at the Philharmonic Hall, eventually had to leave his job as a result of the condition. Since Daveaposs death, a Go Fund Me page has been set up by Rachelaposs cousin Rebecca to help ease financial pressures for the bereaved family. Rachel said: He was such a calm person who tackled everything with a smile even though he was in so much pain constantly. He was always there to help me up when I was having a bad day and help me to put one foot in front of the other. His job got too physical for him eventually and we needed someone to be at home to be there for our eldest son who has autism, so it made sense for him to come out of work. After leaving his job at the Philharmonic, Dave began training to be a teacher through an Open University course and later at Edge Hill University.  Rachel said: He really wanted to be a physics teacher at secondary school, he had the patience of a saint. Rachel said her sons are utterly devastated and are both grieving for their dad in their own way, adding they have both been amazing. I couldnapost have wished for a better daddy for the boys. We did all kinds with them, we went to Lego Land, Alton Towers and Majorca, wherever we went we would try to make a holiday out of it.

But she said the meal descended into aposchaosapos and she compared it to scenes from popular sitcom Fawlty Towers.The pensioner told Stoke-on-Trent Live : My husband and I celebrated New Yearaposs Eve with my two friends.We booked the meal and an overnight stay in November. We paid £. each for the meal and £. for a room and we ordered our food before we got there. But the food we were served was totally dferent.Did you suffer a disastrous New Yearaposs Eve experience  Contact webnews@mirror When we arrived the hotel was beautul. But the meal was supposed to start at pm and we waited until pm for our mushroom and tarragon soup. And then when it came it was cold. We then waited until after pm for our main course. It took so long to arrive because we could see other people were sending their meals back. Dianne, who is from Leek, Staffordshire, said other diners left the establishment midway through the evening. Her party stayed - only to be served rock hard potato and cold vegetables.  For the main course we were served a piece of meat, with a rock hard potato and a giant carrot that wasnapost even cut and some pieces of broccoli and green beans. I ed my meal because it was cold and I was never given a replacement. When I asked why it was cold they said it was because they had to bring it up two flights of stairs, she added. For dessert we were just given one pudding between the four of us, which was supposed to be a chocolate orange tart but it was a chocolate brownie with some ice cream. They didnapost explain why we only had one. When we asked for the cheese board there were no crackers and just four grapes. By the end of the night everybody was demanding their money back.  Dianneaposs party and other diners were given a refund at the end of the night. She said: We didnapost receive an explanation for what went wrong or an apology. It was the worst New Yearaposs Eve Iaposve ever had. We had been looking forward to having a good time with friends but it was terrible. If I hadnapost had a glass of champagne I would have got in my car and gone home rather than staying the night. They had a responsibility to make New Yearaposs Eve special for their guests. It was not a good start to the New Year - and I love New Yearaposs Eve. It was like an episode of Fawlty Towers, I was just waiting for a lady to come along and shout aposBasilapos. It was awful. The venue has aposapologisedapos to guests.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum has lted the lid on how she set up a £ million beauty business with her daughters from their home. Maxine Laceby worked in sales until she was  and then became a full-time mum to her two daugters. After Darcy, , and Margot,  left home to go to university, Maxine decided to do a university fine art degree. Her degree made her think about her lestyle and she started brewing broth to improve her hair and skin, Birmingham Live reports. To make the broth, Maxine simmered chicken feet and pigs trotters in pans at home for hours to make a gelatinous stock which she drank. Her friends noticed the broth was making her hair and skin glow, and they soon started asking for her secret remedy. Maxine then knew the product had potential so she bottled it and launched her company Absolute Collagen. Now, with the help of her daughters Darcy, , and Margot, , her company Absolute Collagen is set to turnover £ million in just three years. “My second project at uni was all about being the person I am and so I stripped back, let my hair go grey, wore no make-up and dowdy clothes,” said Maxine, now  and from Wolverhampton, West Midlands. “It made me realise how desperately insecure I felt about how I looked and it made me rethink everything about myself. I went through an emotional and spiritual period of putting myself together and that included looking at what I was putting into my body.” Maxineaposs broth dramatically changed her hair and skin - and her friends were soon knocking on her door asking her to make them soon. “People said you look sparkling, what are you doing ” said Maxine, “my skin was glowing, my hair was shiny. The only thing I could attribute it to was the broth. “I looked into it and realised it was the collagen in the bone broth that was having an effect so I began making massive vats of it at home, like some kind of white witch, and I’d have friends banging on my door for my booty! she laughed.  Realising she was onto something, Maxine researched the collagen supplement market and found that many products available contained small amounts of collagen and that she wanted to create a product that would contain the maximum amount of marine collagen that could be absorbed into the bloodstream - for the minimum price. “When I was a  child , we were always on the breadline, she said, my mum earned a minimum wage her whole le. As a six-year-old I remember walking round department stores wondering why my mum couldn’t afford the same products as other mums.” Maxine telephoned the Food Standards Agency and told it she was onto a great product but didn’t know where to start. The person she spoke to was both helpful and excited about her product and advised her on the governing bodies she needed to talk to. Maxine found a ‘blender’ to help her to make sachets she could distribute that were palatable and not too gloopy to drink.  “He told me I could add less collagen and make more money but it was never about money, I wanted results. It was about finding a product that I knew worked and to bring it to as many people as possible. “People told me I was selling it too cheap but I don’t think beauty should be pocket deep. So I knew I couldn’t afford a retail store or a distributor and that I’d have to do it myself from home. I spoke to competitors and they told me I was a little fish in a big lake and that I’d get eaten alive. “But I could see there were faults in all of the products out there. I think mums are very solution-focused, we will always find a way.”  In May , Maxine launched her website Absolute Collagen so that people could buy her supplements from her directly and she began to market it via social media. At the end of her first financial year, she had turned over an amazing half a million pounds. In the second year that rose to two and a half million and now she’s on track to turnover £ million by the end of her third financial year, having just successfully launched in the USA. It’s all from one product that’s  per cent natural and sold in recyclable sachets, she said. “It just grew and grew. I used an app whereby every time a sale came though, you’d hear a ping and, when it got to the stage where it was pinging all the time, my daughter said I reckon you’re onto something here. She went onto do her university dissertation on our product.”  Darcy and Margot now work with their mum, helping her with marketing and shipping some , products a year from their home in Wolverhampton. They have now bought a premises in Telford as they were getting swamped by their stock and are planning to move into there in March. “We don’t out source the distribution because that would put a barrier between us and the customer, she said. Doing it this way means we can add in hand written notes and little gts like home fragrance. We also make sure we reply to every single message we receive, I think that’s really important.” Maxine’s Absolute Collagen costs £. for a box of  daily sachets when bought as a subscription, or £. for non-subscribers. She has dyslexia  and ADHD, which she sees as a positive as it means she sees things dferently to others. “I have to read things over and over and I know I couldn’t just write a blog without getting someone to go through it, which is annoying as I love writing, she explained. “My mum was illiterate so I always assumed I had poor reading and writing because of that. It wasn’t until I went to university aged  that I was diagnosed but looking back it was obvious. Both my children are dyslexic too.  “I see it as a gt because it means I have the confidence to ask for help. I’ve always had to and I’ve always had to say when I don’t understand something. “I adored every moment of being a stay at home mum but I always knew I would do something, evenI didn’t know what that would be. She added: So many people feel they have nowhere to go once their children have flown the nest but  is young nowadays. Going to uni and starting a business at  excited me so much. And now my kids work with me too.

Soleimani, commonly thought of as the second most powerful man in Iran, was killed in Iraq in a US drone strike at a convoy at Baghdad airport on Friday. The military commander was killed alongside Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the PMF. Now a video has been shared on Twitter by Babak Taghvae, who describes himself as defence analyst, showing five coffins placed on seats of a plane - allegedly including the bodies of Soleimaniaposs and al-Muhandis. While Mr Taghvae shared the clip, which also shows two men sat in the row in front of the coffins, it isnapost clear who recorded it. He wrote with his post: A Mahan Air Airbus A carried coffins of Qasem Soleimani  Abu-Mahdi Al-Muhandis to Tehran right on the passenger seats instead of being loaded in cargo hold. Commonly bodies are shipped via cargo  planes but it appears Iranian authorities may have decided to put the men on seats as a mark of respect. It comes after Soleimaniaposs body was transported through the Iranian city of Mashhad earlier today as part of a grand funeral procession across the Islamic Republic.  Mourners crowded around military personnel in Mashad unloading Soleimaniaposs casket covered with an Iranian flag from a plane at Ahvaz International Airport in Tehran. A tide of mourners chanted furiously as his coffin was driven through tens of thousands in the streets of the southwestern city Ahvaz where funeral processions began. Live footage aired on state TV showed mourners wearing black and beating their chests as they walked through the streets. Crowds furiously chanted aposDeath to Americaapos as they paraded the slain military commander.  Iranian leaders have vowed to avenge the death of the -year-old, who was esteemed as the countryaposs second most powerful figure after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The drone strike has been widely condemned by international leaders who fear that diplomatic tensions could escalate into a war with the US. The US regarded Soleimani as a terrorist.

The festive blackout was a total disaster for parents-of-three Andrew and Rhonda Robinson who were left very very angry and having to find old-fashioned means of entertaining their restless kids. The couple, from Dunston, Gateshead, near Newcastle upon Tyne, were forced to buy a disposable mobile phone to use in the house. The familyaposs three mobile phones are all on Sky packages and use the Wi to boost their signal but with the internet connection cut off none of them could use their mobiles at home, reports the Newcastle Chronicle.Andrew and Rhonda said they even resorted to emailing the companyaposs chief executive after repeatedly getting told dferent things. Nine-year-old son Thomas has severe learning dficulties and relies on access to the internet, with his parents having bought him a new tablet for Christmas which he couldnapost use for more than a week until the issue was resolved. The couple claim theyaposd initially been told their service was due for a routine update at the end of November, but the changes were beset with faults. Eventually, they say, the entire package was cut off meaning they lost access to their landline phone, internet and Sky television channels. And despite apologies from Sky and automatic compensation due to the family, as well as cash to cover extra expenditure, they remain unimpressed.  The provider said the problem was down to an issue with systems at Openreach, which maintains phone cables and infrastructure. Andrew, who pays roughly £ a month for Sky Q, broadband, and three Sky mobile phones, attempted to cancel the service and sign up with a new provider but this was left in limbo behind all the requests to fix the initial problems. A BT Openreach engineer was finally sent out on January  to fix the problem, with the family also offered £ in a aposgoodwill gestureapos as well as a WiFi hotspot and an offer to refund their mobile packages. The -year-old dad said: We kept getting told, aposyouaposll get an update in a week, youaposll get it in two weeksapos. We kept getting told dferent things. We had got to the stage of emailing the chief executive of Skyaposs office directly, just to get someone from the customer service team to deal with us. It got to the point where we had no internet, no phone - it ruined the bairnaposs Christmas. He got a tablet for Christmas and he couldnapost use it, and we couldnapost explain that to him in a way he could understand. We are very, very angry. The dad works in customer relations for Vodaphone, and says heaposs been particularly unimpressed with the way his complaints have been handled.

Louise Jordan, , said that something inside told her that she should pay a visit to the optician - an instinct that led to the medical procedure which hurt like hell. The mum-of-two, from Bloxwich, West Midlands, thought that her eyes were completely fine, but when she spotted a letter from the optician, she booked in for a check up just to be on the safe side. After doing a full eye scan in June last year, optometrist Taj Showker quickly realised things werenapost as they should be. There was a suspicious lesion on the back of Louiseaposs right eye and she was referred straight to the doctor at the Nuffield Hospital in Wolverhampton for further tests. Louise was diagnosed with a choroidal melanoma - a cancer affecting part of the eye. Medics discovered a tumour at the back of her right eye. She was warned they needed to operate to attach a radiotherapy plaque, emitting eye- sparing low energy radiation therapy for  hours.  The procedure involved Louise being placed under general anaesthetic and having her eye clamped open, before surgeons used a scalpel to split open her eye, go underneath her eyelid and slide a plaque with radioactive seeds on one side of it behind her eye and sewing it there - aiming the seeds at the tumour. She said: I couldnapost see what they were doing, but it hurt like hell. Louiseaposs husband could only visit her in hospital for a couple of hours at a time, meaning she spent a lonely four days in bed following her procedure. She will not know until her next appointment in Novemberthe treatment was a success. If the radiotherapy hasnapost worked she could lose her eye.  She will have her final check up to make sure she is clear of the cancer later this year. Louise said: It was such a shock. Having no symptoms at all, you never anticipate something like this. Iaposm glad I caught it in time becausenot I could have gone blind. Louise is a keen believer that everything happens for a reason, and said that friends at work have nicknamed her Positive Polly for remaining optimistic throughout the whole thing. She said: I was looking through a pile of mail for something and when I saw the eye test letter, something inside me told me I needed to go.

The billionaire paedophileaposs death was officially ruled as suicide by hanging at Manhattan politan Correctional Center, despite speculation and conspiracy theories he was murdered. The graphic photos show the deep bloodied cut to the -year-oldaposs neck and the severed neck bone, as well as strips of orange sheet fashioned into nooses, with one looped through a bed post inside his cell. Obtained by  Minutes and broadcast for the first time in America on Sunday, the images were captured last August with Epstein having taken his own le while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges. They also show other bed sheets strewn across the floor, fragments of material dangling from a window, his body on a trolley and a handwritten note complaining about conditions.  Almost three months on from the disgraced financieraposs death, Dr Michael Baden, who was hired by the paedophileaposs brother, Mark, to observe the post-mortem, suggested Epstein could have been strangled by someone in his cell.  In an interview with Fox News, Dr Baden - a former coroner in New York - rejected the official findings and claimed Epsteinaposs body bore telltale signs of homicide. The -year-old said Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specically the Adam’s apple, and a broken left hyoid bone above the Adam’s apple. Dr Baden, who has probed cases involving OJ Simpson, President John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jnr, said: “I think that the evidence points toward homicide rather than suicide.  “Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation. In his -year career he has not seen a suicidal hanging case where those injuries have occurred, he said, adding: “Hanging does not cause these broken bones. Homicide does.” There were also haemorrhages in Epstein’s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon in suicidal hangings, he added.  Dr Baden, a Fox News contributor, claimed there were signs of “unusual” activity “from day one” of the autopsy. New Yorkaposs medical examiner has not yet responded to his claims. He called for a fresh investigation into Epsteinaposs death, saying a number of people would have to be involvedit was a homicide. Evidence on the ligature could help to prove whether someone was involved in Epsteinaposs death.  The expert also cited a “total breakdown in security” around Epsteinaposs cell and rejected claims that the guards had fallen asleep as two CCTV cameras maled. Dr Baden said his own investigation is not complete. He has examined more than , bodies during his career and hosted the HBO programme Autopsy.  Just weeks before his death, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with marks around his neck in what was thought to be a possible suicide attempt at the time. He was put on suicide watch but removed a week later. He was not sharing a cell with another prisoner at the time of his death. The guards responsible for keeping an eye on Epstein the night he killed himself have been charged with falsying records and conspiracy.

General Soleimani, head of Iranaposs elite Quds Force, was seen smiling as he embraced Hezbollahaposs Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah during a meeting in Beirut. The military chief is also seen praying in the images - understood to have been taken last week - which were released by Iranian media on Sunday. Secretary-General Nasrallah has vowed to avenge his friendaposs death, saying US forces would pay the price for the drone strike that killed General Soleimani near Baghdadaposs airport last Friday. He said in a televised speech: The American army killed them and it will pay the price. The only just punishment isAmerican military presence in the region: US military bases, US warships, each and every officer and soldier in the region. He said US civilians, including businessmen, engineers, journalists and doctors, should be spared.  He added: When the coffins of American soldiers and officers... start toto the United States,Trump and his administration will realise they have lost the region. The Hezbollah leader also called on Iraq to free itself of the American occupation. Hezbollah has been deemed a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and the Arab League.  General Soleimani was killed in a strike on his convoy after landing at Baghdadaposs airport, sending the Iran-US conflict into unprecedented territory amid a spiralling crisis. Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has finally broken his silence on the strike and the growing crisis in the Middle East following his Caribbean holiday.  The PM had faced criticism over his silence and his refusal to cut short his trip to Mustique. In a statement released on Sunday evening, Mr Johnson did not condemn Mr Trumpaposs actions, saying: Today I have spoken with President Macron, President Trump and Chancellor Merkel, and will be speaking with other leaders in the coming days. General Qassem Soleimani posed a threat to all our interests and was responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region. Given the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death.  It is clear however that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no-oneaposs interest. We are in close contact with all sides to encourage de-escalation. I will be speaking to other leaders and our Iraqi friends to support peace and stability.

In the clip, she sports a iety of dferent coloured wigs and skin tones, from light to dark. But some have taken offence at this, suggesting Ghadeer has shown disrespect to cultures.This is the most offensive thing I’ve seen. You can portray togetherness without disrespecting an entire culture. So uneducated, this is beyond unnecessary and unacceptable, wrote one Instagram user.This is just a straight up black face, which is very offensive and as an educated makeup artist you should know better about that, you want to show your abilities or talent on black skin USE A BLACK MODEL !!! Period, another added. Others have urged the beauty influencer to delete the post. PLEASE DELETE THIS. Darkening your face, regardless of the context or the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface, reads a comment.  But Ghadeer, from Kuwait, defended herself online. She wrote: I am not racist.. I hate racism. What I’ve done is only to show what I am capable of… I love you all.

win for his side and the second a late leveller at Tannadice.He may only have made  appearances for the club before injury ended his career early but McPake’s leadership on the pitch earns him a place in this team.Andrew RobertsonVery little has to be said about this choice – Robertson was a star in the making at Tannadice.Arriving as an unknown -year-old from Queen’s Park, Robertson swtly made the left-back place his own and became well-known for rampaging runs down the flank.Just a year later, he was off to Hull City for £. million and has since become a European Cup winner with Liverpool and Scotland captain.His  games for United brought five goals.Midfielders:Gary Mackay-StevenThe wing wizard edged out Dundee favourite Gary Harkins for the right-wing berth in our team.‘GMS’ was an entertainer with an array of tricks and flicks and was a major part of the free-flowing football that made the Tangerines a regular top-six outfit under Jackie McNamara.Stuart ArmstrongArmstrong and ‘GMS’ were inseparable at the top end of Scottish football for years before the former moved down south to Southampton.Armstrong’s athleticism and ability on the ball made him the focal point of United’s attack during six years at the club from  to .Kevin ThomsonHe may only have played  times for the Dens Park club.However, Thomson’s ability and nous in the middle of the park played a huge role in Dundee’s top-six finish in -.Craig ConwayA man scoring two goals in a Scottish Cup Final win is a must for a team like this.A compact, tricky attacker, Conway went on to enjoy a fine career for himself down south after making his name at Tannadice.Strikers: Greg StewartPlucked from Cowdenbeath, Stewart was arguably Dundee’s Player of the Decade.Shortlisted for the -

draw at Tannadice showed exactly why Dundee United are where they are.The Dark Blues probably were the better team in the end and they’ll take plenty of positives out of it but it was a good result for the Tangerines, too.I agree with manager Robbie Neilson saying his side didn’t play as well as they could have.For some reason, they looked a bit anxious and nervy in the second half which is completely unlike them.United had done so well in the previous derbies and been so assured it was a surprise to see them just lump the ball forward as the game wore on.However, the sign of a title-winning team is they can still take a point despite not playing well against one of the better sides in the ision.And they even extended their lead at the top as, once more, the other sides failed to take advantage of United dropping points.For James and his side, they were far better than previous derby showings, that much is obvious.It was a step forward for them and will give their fans a positive jolt heading into the new year.I still think they have problems creating chances.They had lots of good play in the second half but still can’t convert that into clear-cut opportunities.Look at the stats and, though Dundee about edged the game for me, United still had more shots on goal.I do think the way the Dens gaffer has set up his team recently suits them better and that showed on Friday night.There’s more balance in the midfield with Fin Robertson and Graham Dorrans taking turns to control things in the middle.It’s taken a while, which is understandable given the big changes in the summer, but James is starting to find a good formation and his best starting XI.These things always take time but it seems like the Dee are getting there.The key is they kick on from here.For United, it’s about ticking over and keeping themselves well clear of any trouble at the top.Sounds like there were a fair few interested parties at the derby, no doubt taking a look at Lawrence Shankland after his goalscoring exploits this season.It wouldn’t surprise methose English clubs were keeping an eye on Robertson and Dorrans either, the way those two are performing."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united right to call out racism","story":"Watching the derby on TV there were a few times I thought things might spill over from the stands.I wasn’t expecting any alleged racism to come out from the any part of the support, however, as appears to be the case from a video that has emerged.I think Dundee United have handled it in the right way, calling it out strongly.There’s no place for any sort of racism at football – or anywhere  for that matter."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/KMil_McManus_FirstFoot-018.jpg ","title":"mcmanus welcome in new year with first foot event","story":"Museum officials have been banging the drum on behalf of The McManus and invited people to visit the popular attraction.Guest pipers and staff welcomed members of the public with the traditional new year event and introduced them to the iety of attractions on offer for the winter season.One of the most talked-about exhibitions is Among the Polar Ice, a display of contemporary and historic works by artists who have experienced le on the ice.It has been made up from Dundee’s fine art and whaling collections featuring a number of polar artworks spanning  years.

I think that is starting to show on the pitch.“Looking back over the past few weeks, at the time you want three points at Arbroath but, in hindsight, it was a decent point in hard conditions.“They are no mugs and showed that at the weekend again.“We went into Dunfermline and Partick and picked up two positive results but we are taking it a game at a time, maintaining our focus and working hard.“That’s all we can do, trust the management and then trust what we can do on the pitch.“We had so many bodies coming in during the summer, a massive turnover and that always takes a little while.“The manager has changed things, formations, tactics, and I do feel we are starting to click a bit better.“It’s only positive right now for us and we need to keep our head down. We can only do our job and not bother about other teams in the league.”Skipper Meekings and his team-mates took a lot out of the - draw at leaders Dundee United, particularly after going behind so early.“We showed a lot of character and dug in last Friday,” he added.“We’d been behind before in derbies and obviously suffered after that but this time we showed a bit of character and got back into it in the second half.“I think the last  minutes we gave it our all but couldn’t quite get that second goal.“It’s a good point on the road after a good period where we have picked up some points.“We had a sticky period and we’ve got out of it.“It was dficult at Tannadice the previous time so it is a bit more positive.”The -year-old, however, admits he feared the Dark Blues could have been in for another long night at Tannadice after Nicky Clark nipped in front of him to score after five minutes.A few choice words at half-time, though, brought out much better from Dundee in the second period.“When you are a centre-half and an early goal goes in against you, you think ‘we’ve got it all to do now’.“The boys dug deep, we all got stuck in – there was a bit said at half-time between the players and we needed that.“Moving forward, we need that drive and energy because it is a long season still – we are only halfway done and there is plenty to play for.”Meekings was also pleased to be able to give the club’s fans a cheerier festive period after a pretty gloomy .He added: “Hopefully, we gave our fans a decent Christmas and they could enjoy the New Year a bit more.“We would have loved to have given them three points but I think we showed passion and did everything we could last Friday.“We couldn’t quite get that second goal but it is a positive result.“If you show energy and passion like that, the fans will respond.“We wanted the three points but the derby was a positive point and the fans kept backing us.“We’ll keep fighting for them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-fell-love-marlene","story":"MAGNETIC, marvellous Marlene Dietrich made the front page of the Evening Times - of course - when she came to Glasgow on November , ."},{"url":null,"title":"greatest-gift-glasgow---burrell-collection-marks-75-years","story":"WHEN Sir William Burrell gave his collection to Glasgow  years ago it was described as ldquoone of the greatest gts ever made to any city in the world."},{"url":null,"title":"back-day-glasgows-first-boom---12th-century","story":"THIS week we travel back to the late th and early th century to see how Glasgow went from a small settlement of Christians to a growing presence in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"dedicated-fans-britain-away-day-glasgow-clan","story":"For years, it has been seen as a badge of honour amongst sports fans, especially football fans in Scotland, with away attendances seen as a source of pride or embarrassment."},{"url":null,"title":"five-fitness-alternatives-joining-gym-glasgow-new-year","story":"ON TUESDAY evening, millions of people across the world celebrated the end of a decade and the beginning of a new one."},{"url":null,"title":"food-rationing-glasgow---80th-anniversary","story":"JANUARY is traditionally a lean month. as families recover from the excesses of the festive season by choosing to diet, drink less and live more economically."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-science-centre-ai-can-us","story":"ARTIFICIAL Intelligence is a modern phrase that often instils fear in the hearts of the general public.

However, Aberdeen have the right people in charge and are built to deliver success.“The facilities at Cormack Park are great, but ultimately it is the people that matter.“I am a great believer in people. Aberdeen have the right people with Derek McInnes, Tony Dochertyand Gordon Marshall .“They have a really good first team squad and then there is Neil Simpson .”The Bosman ruling was passed by the European Court of Justice in  and ruled that clubs no longer had to pay transfer fees after the expiration of a player’s contract.The rule was the result of Belgian midfielder Jean-Marc Bosman’s fight against his then-employer RFC Liege.Before the Bosman ruling, a player could not leave at the end of their deal unless that club agreed to let him go on a free, or that club received an agreed fee from a buying club. The Bosman ruling allowed a player to leave a club on a free transfer as soon as their contract expired.That flipped the balance of power as players now had leverage to demand signing-on fees and salaries from new clubs to make up for absent transfer fee.Players coming to the end of their contract could also ask for more money from their current club, who would fear losing that player on a free.Aberdeen are in the driving seat with Cosgrove and McKenna as both are secured on long-term contracts.Middlesbrough, Derby County and Stoke City are tracking prolic scorer Cosgrove, who became the first Aberdeen player to net  goals before Christmas since Duncan Shearer in .Cosgrove is contracted until the summer of , having signed an extension last January.QPR are also reportedly set to step up their interest in centre-back McKenna after having a bid rejected towards the English summer transfer deadline.Aberdeen had rejected a £.m bid from Aston Villa for McKenna the previous summer window.McKenna is contracted to Aberdeen until summer .Capped  times for Scotland, McKenna is a product of the Pittodrie youth system and recently made his th appearance for the Reds. Clark is confident Aberdeen’s youth system will continue to produce first-team talent.He believes the £m Cormack Park, which is home to the Bobby Clark Football Academy, will be fundamental to that.He said: “Cormack Park can help bring through young players and it is great that Neil Simpson is now the director of coaching.“When I think back to Simmy, he was the first boy that progressed from the schoolboy coaching into Aberdeen’s ranks.“For him to have made that jump and then to have played as well as he did, to now be running it, is absolutely fantastic.”Signed in , Clark won all three domestic trophies with Aberdeen.Capped  times for Scotland, he was part of the  World Cup squad in Argentina."},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow

As he unwrapped it his eyes gleamed with excitement.ldquoYes! he called out, hugging his mother and father. It was a huge bottle of ketchup, the real stuff! That may not sound such a present, but it was not easy to get this kind of ketchup in the village and he had always had to use it sparingly. Now he had this bottle all to himself.Then Marcela open her unusual present. She smiled as she held two unusual looking carved short planks of wood, unsure initially what they were.

She nervously wheeled her chair onto the snow covered front path. Usually the wheels would stick within seconds, but this time her chair slid effortlessly along the path.Soon she had got the hang of manoeuvring the chair in the snow. She had snow ball fight and was able to spin around and chase her schoolmates while storing lots of ammunition on her lap.Then she decided she wanted to sledge down the hill.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

The Right Honourable the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the head of Lyon Court, is the Scottish official with responsibility for regulating heraldry in the country, issuing new grants of arms, and serving as the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon, the oldest heraldic court in the world that is still in daily operation.\"The general principle would be that Scots can have arms  banners in principle,\"said Mr Tibbetts. \"This is borne out historically as former Lord Lyon Sir Thomas Innes [who served from  to ] noted, that the general uptake of heraldry in Scotland is historically far higher per capita than in England.\"Orkney became the third Scottish community to have its own flag, receiving official recognition in April, .It was designed by postman Duncan Tullock, who sketched out his initial idea using his young grandchildrens crayons.Mr Tullocks blue, yellow and red design was voted the best of  designs submitted to the islands council.It replaced an older flag, the red and yellow cross of St Magnus which was considered to be too similar to other national banners.It would take another nine years before a fourth Scottish community flag was approved, leading to a new wave of interest in having a recognised emblem.Mr Tibbetts said: \"For a community a flag firstly provides a simple symbol that locals can connect with together. Secondly it can then be used to raise the visibility of that community externally.\"It is also important nationally as this reinforces the Scottish tradition of having a rich array of symbolism across the nation as seen in tartans and heraldry.\"Caithness kickstarted the latest appetite for new Scottish heraldry, unfurling their flag in January, .It features a Nordic cross and galley symbolising Caithness ancient ties to the Vikings.The Caithness flag flies next to the Saltire in Wick MarinaThe design was picked from suggestions sent to Highland Council from all over the world.Six months later there was one in Kirkcudbrightshire and then a flag in Denny and Dunipace in Stirlingshire.The Kirkcudbrightshire flag was organised to mark the Queens th birthday.The green and white quarters reference the checks that appeared on a former local authoritys coat of arms, and also the checked cloth used historically to count taxes by the Stewards of the Lords of Galloway.It also features a St Cuthberts cross to reference the origin of the name Kirkcudbrightshire as the \"shire of the church of Cuthbert\".Denny and Dunipaces town flag is a green, white and blue design showing the River Carron separating Dunipace and its -pointed star to the north and Dennyrsquos two-towered castle symbolising the River of Forts to the south.Raising the South Uist flagIn the Western Isles, South Uists Nordic cross in the pattern of Norways flag secured official recognition for its banner in May, .Donnie Steele, a former councillor, championed South Uists flag, organising a petition to gather support for official recognition.:Barra flag officially recognised six months after terror victimrsquos deathAnd by the end of that year Barras green and white Nordic cross, used by residents of the Hebridean island for decades secured official recognition.In June, that year, the flag was draped over the coffin of Barras Eilidh MacLeod, , who was among the victims of the Manchester Arena attack.Tiree unfurled its new official flag in September, last year. Donald Camerons green and gold \"Land of Barley\" design was chosen after a competition launched earlier that year.\"A competition allows for hundreds of designs to be in with a shout. By engaging with the community, such as with the school talks on Skye, and including information with the competition pack explaining what makes an effective flag then as many people as possible can be given as good a chance as possible at creating eligible designs and ultimately winning the final public vote,\" said Mr Tibbetts.Another public vote led to Sutherland beingamong the latest to get official recognition in December, Source: Philip TibbettsThe winning design featuresa Saltire and a Nordic cross. Three other flags were in contention, including one originally selected by a judging  and drew public criticism for its eagle and stars design.The design represents Sutherlands position as the historic mainland frontier between Scotland the Vikings.East Lothian also had a new flag registered in the same month after another competition. The designer, Archie Martin, sadly passed away after submitting his design."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10865136.jpg?type=article-full","title":"lip-service-needed-save-scotlands-islands","story":"The number of babies born last year at the Western Isles hospital fell to , compared to  just four years before, while  of the  islands of the Outer Hebrides have become officially uninhabited in the last half century.While some areas have reported a boost in tourism, those coming to snap the white sandy beaches and wildle for their social media pages do not settle and off-season, placesto their near deserted form.Calls are now being made for urgent action by the government to help rebuild some of the countrys most remote areas and help bring them back to le.Rhoda Grant, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP, was born in Lewis and said that in order to attract and retain more people to the islands, jobs and housing must be prioritised.She accused the Scottish Government of paying \"lip service\" to the countrys remote communities without acting on promises to help.Grant explained: \"On government policy, they say they want re-population but they are a centralising government.\"The more you centralise, the more you take good quality jobs out of those areas.

Why did it resonate  Because people lack the means to affect change in their own lives.\"Admitting she had a long way to go to become Labour leader when presented with the current polling figures, the backbencher added: \"This is actually quite profoundly disrespectful to try and bounce people into thinking that theres only one candidate and one candidate can win.\"Sir Keir Starmer, a staunch Remainer who will launch his Labour leadership bid in Brexit-backing Stevenage in Heretfordshire, called on the party to listen to voters to win back their trust.He admitted the ldquoargument about Leave and Remain went with Brexit.The Shadow Brexit Secretary told BBC TVrsquos The Marr Show: ldquoThis election blew away the argument for a second referendum, rightly or wrongly, and we have to adjust to that situation.ldquoThe argument has to move on and the argument now is, can we insist on that close relationship with the EU, close economic relationship, but collaboration in other areas  And also what is the framework now for future trade relations ldquoBecause my concern is less about technical membership of the EU now, itrsquoswe sht our focus from the EU and move away from those standards and arrangements, it is inevitable that Boris Johnson and his Government will look to America for a trade deal and we need to know the terms of that because wersquove had a lot of discussion about the NHS being part of those negotiations, but all public services could be part of those negotiations.ldquoSo, the argument has to move on and we, the Labour Party, need to accept that Leave Remain, that ide, goes in a few weeksrsquo time and we need to focus on what comes next.Sir Keir suggested it would be a mistake to now sht from Labourrsquos radical prospectus.He explained: ldquoWhat Jeremy Corbyn brought to the Labour Party in  was the stance of saying we should be anti-austerity, we should be pro-public services.ldquoThat is right. We donrsquot want to throw that away. Now, Irsquom not pretending that we keep everything as it is, Irsquom not pretending that there was anything good about that General Election result. It was devastating. But we shouldnrsquot retreat from the radical, fundamental change, which is needed in this country and we must deliver it, he added.Jess Phillips admitted Labourrsquos worst General Election defeat since  was down to a mixture of Brexit, Mr Corbynrsquos stewardship and the partyrsquos packed manesto. But the MP for Birmingham Yardley suggested there was an over-arching reason. ldquoThe fundamental thing is that the country didnrsquot trust us to govern. It didnrsquot trust us to deliver on what we were saying and we have got to listen to that, she told the Marr Show.ldquoPolitics has changed and we have got to show that we can change with it. Doing the same thing again it just simply wonrsquot be enough. People have got to feel a connection with us again.ldquoPeople have got to feel like we are on their side and currently - Irsquove heard it since the election, Irsquove heard it before - they just didnrsquot trust that we were going to deliver the things that we said, declared the backbencher.Askedshe had shown loyalty to Mr Corbyn, Ms Phillips replied: ldquoThis shouldnrsquot be a test now of how we feel about each other in the Labour Party. This has got to be about whether the Labour Party can speak and connect and be trusted by the public.ldquoNone of it matters about this fight with this person in the Labour Party unless we can win an election and Labour values is what matters to Labour members and activists.Conspicuous by her absence from todayrsquos airwaves was Rebecca Long Bailey, regarded as the preferred candidate by Mr Corbyn and John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, and thus, because the leadership race will be determined by the still largely Corbynite membership, favourite to winshe stands. The lack of a media presence ahead of tomorrowrsquos meeting of Labourrsquos executive meeting, which will determine the rules of the contest, could suggest she is getting cold feet.The ruling NEC is expected to fire the starting gun on both the leadership and the deputy leadership elections on Tuesday.Ian Murray, the only Scottish MP Labour has in the Commons, is poised to enter the deputy leadership race. Dawn Butler, the Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary, and Richard Burgon, the Shadow Justice Secretary, have already announced their candidacies.The results of both contests are expected in March."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-marr-show-ridge-sunday-reviews","story":"Yes, because there is nothing cheerier than entering a new year with talk of war on the horizon.Marr, like Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday, had two conflicts to cover. The first was between Iran and the US: a genuinely le and death affair. The second, trivial in comparison, was the fight to lead Labour.Ridge, starting at .am, interviewed Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, while he was en route to Marr. Smart idea they should try it with more Marr guests. The central London location just off Whitehall would have been impossible any other time than a Sunday morning. As it was, there was hardly any traffic. London looked asit was still on holiday.Speaking of putting off theto work, Ridge mentioned that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was travelling back from holiday in Mustique. The assassination of Iranrsquos military leader Qasem Soleimani on the orders of President Trump had brought about the biggest crisis in the Middle East since Iraq, said Ridge, yet nothing had been heard from Mr Johnson. Did he think the hard work had been done in winning a majority and he could now put his feet up : Johnson criticised over holidayThe PM was ldquoin charge said Mr Raab, adding that he had spoken to him several times over the festive break. Marr also wanted to know how Boris Johnsonrsquos new government was going to measure up to the moment. Contrary to reports in some of the papers, there had not been a vacuum at the heart of government, insisted the Foreign Secretary.Mr Raabrsquos word of the morning, and one suspects the week, was ldquode-escalation. With so much at stake, including the possible impact on the case of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe, plus British civilian contractors and soldiers in Iraq, Mr Raab had to tread a line between the Trump position and growing unease in Europe, a path he will continue to take next week when he visits the continent before going on to Washington DC.This role ofldquogo-between could be the shape of things to come for any British Foreign Secretary in the post-Brexit political landscape.Both presenters brought up the other item in Mr Raabrsquos increasingly full in-tray: the -year-old British woman convicted of lying about being the victim of a gang rape in Cyprus. Again, a delicate approach was required ahead of sentencing tomorrow, one which expressed concern while not questioning the Cypriot judicial system too much. Mr Raab, a lawyer by trade, found the middle ground.The battle to be Labour leader got off to a snoozy start after the General Election, but the pace is picking up now with more candidates declaring. The most recent to do so, Sir Keir Starmer and Jess Phillips, were on Marr. The intro to the show had them sitting together, which would have made a lively interview, but instead Marr spoke to them separately.: Cox calls for indyrefOver on Ridge, Emily Thornberry was trying to handle the problem faced by every contender: how to court a membership that is heavily in favour of Jeremy Corbyn, and thinks he did nothing wrong, while arguing that radical change is needed. Thornberryrsquos response when askedMr Corbyn was a good leader was to start talking about Iran again, saying that had been taking up her time. Ridge persisted. ldquoJeremy had many, many talents, said the Shadow Foreign Secretary eventually. The reason he was popular with the party was that he spoke from the heart, she added.If that was the main quality of a successful candidate then Jess Phillips would be a shoo-in. The MP for Birmingham Yardley, whether on Twitter, in the Commons, or in one of her many television appearances, is passionate, plain-speaking, and funny. Unfortunately, as far as the task at hand goes, she has used those skills to become one of Corbynrsquos sharpest critics and is not without enemies.Despite a YouGov poll giving her % support among the membership, putting her in third position behind Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, Ms Phillips reckons the party, and the electorate, is in the mood for some straight talking. Labourrsquos key problem was that voters did not trust them to govern, she said.Mr Starmer said Labour had lost due to concerns about the leadership, the partyrsquos woolly position on Brexit, anti-Semitism, and a manesto that was overloaded. On Brexit, he said: ldquoWe should have taken a stronger position one way or the other.: Independence wont be won or lost on financeOtherwise, he was keen to get off the subject as quickly as possible. No s, buts or maybes about a second EU referendum, the UK was leaving and the focus had to be on what comes next.From non-stop Brexit to move along now, nothing to see here, more important matters to deal with.

Factors would move in as soon as the crofts were empty and tear down their roofs or burn them, to prevent them from being re-occupied.In one notorious case the Sutherland Estatersquos man on the ground, Patrick Seller, was charged with culpable homicide after an old woman, who had to be carried out of her home as it was destroyed, died in the days after her eviction.Sellar, who was dismissed from his job during the trial, was acquitted of all charges. In all, around , crofters and their families were cleared from the land, with  becoming known as ldquothe year of the burnings.In  tenants and crofters from across north Sutherland met within the church to give evidence to the royal Napier Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands eventually led to providing security of tenure to crofters across the crofting counties.Strathnaver Museumrsquos refurbishment project is part of a new pound million Scottish programme of projects to invest in the Highlands and Islands to provide better quality opportunities for visitors to enjoy the regionrsquos natural and cultural heritage.The Natural and Cultural Heritage Fund is led by Scottish Natural Heritage and is part funded through the European Development Fund .It is hoped the fund will encourage people to visit some of the more remote and rural areas and create and sustain jobs, businesses and services in local communities.Strathnaver Museum is a volunteer-led accredited rural history museum which explores the social history of the area of north west Sutherland, almost ,sq km known informally as Mackay Country. Situated in Bettyhill on the North Coast  Strathnaver Museum is a popular visitor attraction attracting over , visitors in .The refurbishment project will enhance the visitor experience with the creation of an annex building to the north of the church, which will explore the agricultural story of the area.Improvements to the internal layout of the church will also be carried out to open up access to the collection and create dedicated research spaces where people can study some of the records held by the museum.As well as the vital building work, Strathnaver Museum will also run a three-year community programme of activities to help share and gather knowledge about the heritage of Mackay Country. The main theme will be the Highland Clearances and explore topics such as land use, culture, migration, industry and politics.In  internal alterations saw the removal of the two galleries and the insertion of some party walls. The refurbishment plans have been drawn up by Bonar Bridge based CH Architecture and will see the removal of some of these party walls and install a bridge link which will give visitors an idea of the view from the galleries of the pulpit and lower gallery.Tommy Mackay Strathnaver Museum Chairman said ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded funding by the Natural and Cultural Heritage Fund towards our refurbishment project. The funding will allow us to enhance the visitor experience, sustain jobs and the services we deliver and enable us to continue to promote the natural and cultural heritage of our area and the Highlands more widely.Francesca Osowska, SNH Chief Executive, added: ldquoA key priority for SNH is to help ensure tourism and other sectors benefit from, and invest in, Scotlandrsquos high quality environment.ldquoNature and culture are closely linked in the Highlands  Islands, and in many places they are central to the local economy, maintaining rural populations, jobs and skills.

May and it was the only home he had ever known.Tia and Sulley found their forever home with mother and daughter, Ria and Alex. It was time for Alex to move on from her reliable horse William and let him retire.William saw Ria through devastating times when Alex was diagnosed with leukaemia ten years ago.Ria said: “We are absolutely over the moon with our new additions.“We rehomed the pair in September and they have settled in so well. Alex has bonded with both of them so it was definitely the right decision.“I wanted to be absolutely sure they were the horses for us so we visited many times over the summer. By the time we took them home, Alex had fallen in love with them both.“Alex was diagnosed with leukaemia around ten years ago and it was a very dficult time for us. Thankfully, she was given a clean bill of health and is looking forward to her  years in remission in .“Alex has shown amazing commitment and helped with all the hard work of not just riding horses but caring for them to prove she was ready for her own horse that she could progress on with.“She’s always loved animals, we all do, and it has been the best decision. It’s been the best thing for her recovery, physically and mentally.“Horses are amazingly intuitive, as I found with William. He wasn’t the easiest Highland pony but when I needed him to be there he took me off into the hills to just scream sometimes.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Santa outside Inverurie Specsavers\"  Santa visits Inverurie optician viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"“Not once after Alex’s diagnosis did he ever hesitate.

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh’s world-renowned Roslin Institute say it is possible to cull numbers of the mammals by editing their DNA to ensure that all future females are born infertile. The institute, famous for creating Dolly the Sheep, the world’s first mammal cloned from an adult cell, hoped to create gene-edited male squirrels that can be released into the wild. The mammals would be altered to contain a so-called ‘gene drive’ designed to spread throughout the population, and render all females to inherit it sterile. Males, however, would be unaffected, so as to allow them to keep spreading the new genetic code, and ultimately hastening the grey’s demise. The initiative is supported by some as a humane means of stopping the spread of the invasive species and protected the red squirrel, which is native to the UK, but survives only in isolated strongholds, with the vast majority found in parts of Scotland. However,animal rights campaigners dismissed the idea as “reprehensible,” and warned it would not solve long standing ecological problems. The project, which is part-funded by the European Squirrel Initiative, a charity that promotes research into the conservation of red squirrels, would also have implications for efforts to rid Britain of other invasive species, such as mink, muntjac deer, and ring-necked parakeets. The team at the Roslin Institute point to the fact that the grey squirrel is a carrier of squirrel pox, which is lethal to the red squirrel. Without conservation efforts, it is predicted that reds could be lost from the UK altogether by . Professor Bruce Whitelaw, the institute’s genus personal chair of animal biotechnology, is spearheading the squirrel project. “A potential application of gene drives is to control invasive vertebrate pests, such as cane toads and rabbits in Australia, grey squirrels in the UK, possums in New Zealand and rodents around the globe,” he explained in a journal article co-authored with Gus McFarlane, a fellow researcher.They have asked a team of genome engineers, population modellers, ecologists, ethicists and conservation experts to design gene drives as a “potential tool” to eradicate grey squirrels.“We are investigating strategies that could humanely control the UK grey squirrel population,” Mr McFarlane said. “One is spreading female infertility.” Another possible drive changes the sex ratio, favouring the birth of males over females until the population becomes mostly male.Andrew Kendalll, a spokesman for the European Squirrel Initiative, said: “ “The aim would be to create a few thousand gene-edited greys and then release them so the gene spreads, slowly wiping the species out in the UK. We want to reverse the invasion.“It is very humane - there is no need for trapping or shooting - they just stop reproducing.”However, Jenner White, a spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said: “People accept that genetically engineering humans is morally unconscionable and doing the same to squirrels using gene-drive technology is just as reprehensible. “It won’t solve our ecological problems but will lead to misery for intelligent, sensitive beings.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch labour can t simply back independence it must rediscover its soul","story":"There is no point in the party simply switching to a pro-independence stance without creating its own particular position argues Lesley Riddoch.Scottish Labour should beware enemies offering advice, like changing course to support a second independence referendum.So warned Euan McColm in yesterday’s Scotland on Sunday and he is surely correct. But not because supporting indyref would leave the party worse off. It just wouldn’t be enough to tackle the big, central, yawning problem tugging away at the soul of the People’s Party north of the Border since managerialism first gripped New Labour under Tony Blair. What is Scottish Labour’s raison d’etre  What are its core beliefs  In a country where the SNP speaks the language of social democracy and Conservatives have stolen the clothes of unionism– literally what’s left The answer seems is currently a torn-looking lucky bag of assorted and often contradictory policies.For example, Scottish Labour wants a public sector bid to run the Scotrail franchise, but opposes devolving powers so Holyrood can scrap the hopeless franchising process and set up a publicly-owned Scottish railway instead. The party does wants to scrap franchising across the whole UK, except that won’t happen for another five years at least. So, what’s good for British voters , is not good for Scottish voters . Go figure. In a similar guddle, Scottish Labour voted to scrap the UK’s Trident nuclear missile system on the Clyde in , but meekly deferred to UK party policy that supports renewal in their  and  manestos. The party wants a living wage that’s a bit higher than the SNP, a Green Deal that’s a lot less radical than the Scottish Greens’ and a policy on Europe – well let’s tiptoe swtly past that mess. Yip, the absence of a coherent line on independence really is the least of Scottish Labour’s problems. Put simply, the party has no soul. No guiding star by which to steer the rough waters of political dissent. No overriding conviction or analysis to compel attention, drive direction and dictate logical positions on thorny issues like independence. Instead Scottish Labour is engaged in a very public and very naked cost benefit analysis of whether to change position on Scotland’s continuing membership of the union. No matter which way it goes, the grubby process will hardly create instant throngs of admiring converts. The truth is that Scottish Labour is stuck opposing independence for all the wrong reasons – in all circumstances, in any weather and no matter what socialist outcomes might be possible north of the Border. All because independence is the sole objective of the party that stole Labour’s birthright in  and – in the eyes of many – will never, ever be forgiven.Hating the SNP bends Scottish Labour further out of shape than any position on independence, because it defies logic, it overwhelms rival motivations , it consumes integrity and reduces politics to the boring business of automatically contradicting the SNP.Argument, to paraphrase Monty Python, is an intellectual process – a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of any statement the other person makes.But that’s what Scottish Labour is reduced to – automatically gainsaying the party that usurped its place, policies, heartlands and voters  years ago.This enduring grudge match fuels nonsensical soundbites like Richard Leonard’s tweet on New Year’s Day: “Johnson’s hard-right Brexit makes me fear for Scotland’s future, but it’s no reason to accept austerity in a separate Scotland as the least worst option.” Whit Or Monica Lennon’s proposal for a separate Scottish Labour party – apparently prompted by John McDonnell’s acceptance of the case for indyref last summer, when he overrode Richard Leonard. But a second vote is now what Ms Lennon wants too. So why the need for a separate party then  Unless it’s because Scotland has a distinct political culture. But accepting that means accepting quite a lot of the case for independence too.So, it’s perfectly true – aping the SNP’s pro-independence  will get Scottish Labour no further than hysterically avoiding it. Any change must be driven by some demonstrable logic – by a conviction that the important, distinctive things Scottish Labour believes in cannot now be delivered within a pan-British context. That’s the big, dficult, public debate the party must now have to create direction and win some respect.Is it worth hanging on within the union, in the vain hope that a new Labour leader can somehow win over English voters  If it isn’t, then Scottish Labour has the reason it needs to make a bold change of direction on independence. Changing tack for any less coherent reason will simply lack credibility. Independence for the sake of independence is kinda taken. Indeed, independence for the sake of dignity, equality and workers’ rights is kinda taken too. So, Scottish Labour should copy its much-reviled political nemesis in one regard only – it must find a shared transformational core belief and use it as the template around which all other policies must fit – including independence.It’s too late for a cynical rebranding exercise. The only options left for Scottish Labour are to vacate the political space they currently inhabit in favour of a new left party or to completely repurpose Scottish Labour. That could be done without reference to any other party, by revisiting the legacy of Tom Johnston – the inspiring wartime Labour Scottish Secretary whose portrait hung in Bute House during Alex Salmond’s years as First Minister. Johnston’s dislike of landed privilege was so great that all copies of his incendiary  book Our Noble Families had to be found and destroyed before he could persuade landowners to accept hydro-electric schemes on their land in the s. His instinct for a small-scale, decentralised, municipal state led him to set up a Building Society in his native Kirkintilloch so that local people’s savings could also finance council services.Johnston might have led Labour and Scotland towards the same kind of decentralised state Norway and Sweden have become,his instincts had prevailed. A modern, re-worked, vision of Johnston’s, empowered, decentralised society is practically the only unoccupied political space in Scotland. Will Scottish Labour dare to explore it or just keep grafting on policies, trying hard not to bang into the SNP, Tories or Greens along the way ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians.

The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa.

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the ghost of policing past visits","story":"I WRITE this column on the th anniversary of the murder of Fearghal Caraher from Cullyhanna. Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"forget bridge tunnel best way to link northern ireland and great britain say experts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

He also re-iterated his Government’s position that their priority is to reconvene Stormont and to put a deal together which makes that possible.“For our part, we impressed on him the responsibility that his Government holds. After all, it was his Government that made that commitment around the Irish language Act in  and  years have passed since then. It is now high time that the rights of Irish speakers have now been included and the rights of Irish speakers are no longer marginalised.”Mr Mac Giolla Bhein said the issue of an Irish Language Act would “still be on the margins”it was not for campaign groups keeping it on the political agenda.He said: “Regardless of what emerges from these talks and whatever deal is put together as a result of these talks, people can be incredibly proud of that. “In terms of the actual deal and what is there for the Irish speaking community – we will reserve judgment until we see the detail on that.”He said in  the Irish language community was promised an Irish language Act as part of the St Andrew’s Agreement and the co-guarantors of The Good Friday Agreement promised “resolute action” for the Irish language in .In a statement following the meeting, Conradh na Gaeilge said it will continue to remind Mr Smith of his duty to implement the Irish language Act.It read: “This new legislation must be drafted, as the St Andrew’s Agreement compels, from the language legislation in Wales and in the south. “Those Acts are independent from any other pieces of legislation. They facilitate rights and respect. They secure services and visibility. They recognise their indigenous language as an official language.“They provide the security of a commissioner to protect and promote the language. That is what the two governments and the parties must deliver with an Irish Language Act. “Speakers of Irish, be they speakers using the language in their home, in their schools or in the community, can no longer be treated as second class citizens.”Sinn Fein’s deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said on Friday that “clearly” there would be an Irish Language Act in any deal to restore the Executive, one of the major sticking points in previous negotiations.“Clearly there will be an Irish Language Act as part of a deal, but what we need to see is a package of measures that allows public confidence to be generated again in our ability to deliver good politics,” Ms O’Neill said.Finding consensus on legislative protections for Irish language speakers is key to unlocking the deadline.Parties are also at odds on proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly – the petition of concern.Three years on from the collapse of the devolved government, the Stormont parties have until a January  deadline to strike a deal to revive the institutions.On that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Ireland’s struggling public services expires and Mr Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap Assembly election.DUP MP for East Londonderry Gregory Campbell said the deadline of January  means “there will be attempts to use it as leverage to get any type of deal over the line as opposed to detailed consideration in order that a good deal is achieved”.He said: “Whether it is one partymaking unacceptable demands or other parties standing side by side to accept that the unreasonable demand is met, will make no dference to us. “Where the Irish language has a perfectly acceptable place in Northern Ireland society and is resourced appropriately, as it already is, there will not be a problem or opposition from the DUP or wider Unionism, where there is an unacceptable and unreasonable demand to elevate it above all other minority languages, whether it is SF, other parties or Her Majesty’s Government saying we will have to yield on this issue as it is preventing devolution ing, we will not do so.“Let us all take this week to see what is doable, negotiate a balanced set of proposals and get it done instead of grandstanding in the hope of gaining a one sided victory.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes. The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

MLA hits out as health service crisis worsensNovember started with the Derry Post reporting that rural areas in the county are the worst affected areas by the ongoing crisis in the health service.Patients awaiting surgery, cancer treatment and domiciliary care packages are facing long and excruciating delays for access to services that an MLA for the area says required immediate government intervention.SDLP Assembly member Patsy McGlone revealed that his constituency office was inundated with concerns over the level of care being offered. He said issues that were being consistently raised included the availability of ambulances and a dearth of staff working in health clinics and hospitals.“Traditionally, at this time of year the demand on health services starts to build, but what is dferent this time is that we have seen an increase in the number of constituents who are coming to us over hospital admissions.“People waiting for surgery, for a consultant appointment- I even had someone with me recently waiting on cancer treatment.“There is no doubt about it, the health system is under pressure, both locally and further afield. It is a resource issue- we need more staff, more consultants, more doctors and more nurses. Those working in our health care system are left coping with the huge demand and are feeling the pressure. We need to invest in staff and we need to do it now,” he said. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last year the Christmas Tree Recycling Scheme raised around pound, and it is hoped that with the support of locals a similar total,not more, can be gathered this time round.Foyle Hospice will accept a suggested donation of pound and once collected the trees will be shredded for use in its Culmore Road gardens. Money raised will be directed towards the palliative care of patients with cancer and other le-limiting illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Parkinsons Disease and COPD.The scheme provides a simple, environmentally friendly and the most charitable way to dispose of your Christmas tree.A Hospice spokesperson said: “We all “joyfully choose our Christmas tree and transport it home ready to dress for the festive period.“However, after “th night” when its needles are dropping the thought of taking it to the household recycling centre or chopping it up to fit into your bin is less appealing.“So, Foyle Hospice and our wonderful team of volunteers will collect your tree on Monday th to Wednesday th January  for a small donation.“We are delighted this year to have received sponsorship for this initiative from Seagate Ltd, who are also providing volunteers to help with the mammoth task of the collection of the trees.“Once collected. We work with our own volunteers and our corporate partners at Elagh Tree Surgery, who give up their time to chip and shred trees and these chips, are recycled for use within the Hospice grounds.”You can book your collection today by registering on the following link: https:register.primoevents ps event ChristmasTreeRecyclingSchemeIf you have any questions please e-mail: fundraising @foylehospice or telephone   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It also saw a change from the dominance of Slaughtneil and Ballinderry for most of the decade. The Emmets knocked out the Shamrocks before falling victim to Glens devastating running game in the semi-final. The Watties were unable to carry that form into the final where a Magherafelt team, while only winning by a point, were worthy winners of the John McLaughlin Cup. Away from the final, Banagher were the story that kicked the championship into le. Despite bring relegated without winning a googletag.cmd.push game, they dumped out Bellaghy and Swatragh before pushing Adrian Cushs side to the pin of their collar in the semi-final. - Daryl McDermottAfter picking up the intermediate goalkeeping spot last year and making the hurling selection, Sticks once again is honoured.He was the undisputed goalkeeper of the year. His kicking against Bellaghy was pin-point and ied. In their win over Swatragh he made two fantastic saves and Magherafelt would have been out of sight only for his brilliance. [nd All-Star]  - Conor McCluskeyWhile also a very capable baller, Clucker was Adrian Cushs go-to marker in defence.He was asked to shackle Colm McGoldrick when Darren ONeill was black-carded. He kept a lid on Peter Hagan in the semi-final while getting forward to add to their attacking arsenal. Jack Doherty and Ryan Johnston also struggled against him. Two messy Benny Heron goals, neither of them his fault, was the only blot on a perfect season. [st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan RogersLike goalkeeper McDermott, Roger is a dual selection.In the Ballinderry game, he did a marking job on Ryan Bell yet still was able to get Slaughtneil on the attack with his trademark barnstorming runs from defence.His absence from full-back left the door open for Glen to exploit but his one man crusade almost pegged the Emmets back to nip the Watties. [th All-Star]  - Fergal DuffinGets the nod ahead of Darren ONeill and was a vital cog in Magherafelts defence.Came out on top of his battle with Ruairi Mooney and he blotted out Conor Feeney on Banaghers kick-outs. He held Kilcoos Paul Devlin scoreless from play but it was his county final performance that stands out. Two moments of bravery to win turnovers that resulted in Rossa scores.[nd All-Star]  - Gavin ONeillCharlie OKane kept Bellaghy guessing with Gavin ONeills jersey number positioning and in his new wing back role, he was immense. The fact that he nicked man of the match ahead of Conor Feeney and Tiarnan Moore spoke wonders of his performance.Swatragh didnt learn the lesson and once again ONeill bossed the game from wing-back, edging the battle with Patrick Kearney.[nd All-Star]  - Connor CarvilleWhen Glen licked their wounds after their hammering in the league by Slaughtneil, it was Connor Carville that learned the most. Following Sammy Bradley left Glen open.In the championship he was a dferent animal and when Oisin Hegarty was dismissed against Loup he was one of Glens leaders.Against Magherafelt he was one of the few to offer any help to goalkeeper Callum Mullan-Young. Glen didnt have enough like him. [st All-Star]   - Conor KearnsWith Michael McEvoy going under the kne, Magherafelts system of play needed someone to link their defence to attack. Kearns fitted the bill and thrived in his new found freedom. He handled an endless supply of ball against Coleraine and didnt look back. His goal proved to be the vital score to sink Banagher. He didnt deserve his season to end prematurely with a harsh black card against Kilcoo. [st All-Star] - SENIOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Danny HeavronThe Rossa skipper once again poured out everything he had for the cause.His influence helped them see off Coleraine and his moment of quick-thinking put Kearns through for the all-important goal against Banagher. In the final he pressed high on Glens kick-outs to turn the game. Against Kilcoo he once again linked the play and was missed during a brief spell at full-forward. [st All-Star]  - Ciaran McFaulAfter Loups goal it was McFauls point that made Glen believe again. When they were staring into a defeat against Lavey, he led the way again and his display of fielding was simply awesome. Against Slaughtneil he plucked another one from the air, just when Glen needed a moment of inspiration.Not as influential in the final as was required. Without him, Glen wouldnt have got there and given three more seconds. he wouldve forced a replay. [nd All-Star]  - Christopher BradleySammy led their scoring charts in the league and it was his accuracy that edged out a well-organised Newbridge in round one. When he found the net against Ballinderry, it cemented Slaughtneils place in the last four.Against Glen, he made their attack tick and was unlucky not be their last gasp hero but Oran McGills left foot denied him a potential winning goal and a county final spot.[rd All-Star]  - Danny TallonDespite being captain, he was replaced against Loup but took it on the chin and came back stronger.Kicked a point against Lavey and plucked two vital balls from the skies as Glen dug themselves out of another hole.He gave Keelan Feeney the runaround in the semi-final. A hamstring injury shadowed his preparation for the final, but he saved his best for last and put in a performance that deserved to lt the John McLaughlin Cup.[st All-Star]  - Emmett McGuckinHis goal against Coleraine kicked off Magherafelts route to glory, as he delivered in spades.Revelling in the freedom of midfield he made his side tick and his performance in the final, along with that of Odhraacuten Lynch, ended the Rossa famine. His scores broke Glens hearts.Kilcoo had no answer to him at full-forward and he didnt deserve to be on the losing side. [st All-Star]  - Francis KearneyDaniel McKinless and Paul Gunning can count themselves unlucky to miss out.Francis Kearney carried his league form into the championship. He was in red hot formover Swatraghs two games. If the Swa had been able to get a handle on Banaghers attack, his scoring power wouldve taken them to the last four. [st All-Star]  - Alex DohertyAnother contender for player of the championship, he pinged - from play and was Glens top scorer.His goal against Lavey was sensational. After beating three men on his road to goal, he powered to the net for the goal that arguably changed Glens season. Scoring - off Karl McKaigue is no mean feat and he backed it up with four mighty points in the final. [st All-Star]  - Tiarnan MooreOne year on from tearing intermediate defences apart, Moore was at it again. His tally of -, with one assist from brother Niall, tore the Bellaghy defence asunder as he revelled in the open spaces.While he didnt score against Swatragh he pulled their defence all over the place as Banagher once again made hay.His frightening pace was one of the stories of the championship.

Meanwhile, EU leaders drown migrants in the Mediterranean, provide arms and political cover for dictatorships infor contracts with European companies, collude in Zionist assaults on Palestinian rights, etc.But everywhere, too, there is revolt. Chile, Hong Kong, France, Catalonia, Iraq, Sudan, etc, have all seen millions in the streets against the rule of the rich over the poor. In Lebanon, a by-word for communal hostility, Sunni, Shia, Christians and Druze have come together in angry array against the elites.Young people in unprecedented numbers have swamped cities demanding radical action to save the planet.Long struggle has finally won abortion rights for Irish women, North and South, and equal marriage in the North.There’s evidence everywhere that the isions which keep the working class enchained can begin to melt in the heat of struggle.In Ireland, the battle lines are drawn between those who want unity of the oppressed in pursuit of a better world and defenders of the riven status quo.The battle is unequal. The forces of the Right seem in the ascendant. But  has also shown the depth of resilience and the fighting capacity of plain people. The magnitude of the masses shouting out across continents has had the character of a global uprising.It is in this that socialists find hope for the future, across all Ireland as throughout the world.Orange and Green politics are useless when it comes to defending the NHS, resisting job losses, opposing welfare “reform,” fighting for civil rights for all, etc.What’s needed is to drive forward and expand the emerging struggle all around us. The same perspective lights the way to Irish unity.Homeless deaths on the streets, hospital patients stacked in corridors, teachers run ragged in over-crowded class-rooms, workers denied union rights, State corruption, a suicide epidemic - all these apply in equal measure North and South. It is by bringing these struggles together that we can transcend the borders within and between us.We in People Before Profit put all our trust in the indomitability of the working class of the world.Pessimism is a weapon to be used against us. We don’t believe we won’t win. Here and everywhere, the vanquished of today will be the victors of tomorrow.These are the perspectives which guide us in our work in trades unions, civil rights campaigns, the environmental movement, and in all .We urge all who sympathise with this approach to join us in struggle in the year to come. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But, is the colder weather having an impact on your sleep  Are you struggling to drt off or waking up feeling chilly  If so, don’t fear. Holly Housby, sleep expert from Sealy UK, is here to help with her top tips for sleeping when it’s cold. Take a bathNot just relaxing, having a bath before bed can actually help to promote sleep and induce tiredness. Your temperature naturally dips at night as your body prepares for rest, beginning about two hours before sleep. When you soak in a hot bath, your temperature rises by a degree or two, and the rapid cool-down immediately after the bath imitates this natural decrease of your body temperature, which can help you to fall asleep faster. googletag.cmd.push Wear woolly socks, not cottonOften, poor circulation means that our feet are the first part of our body to get cold. Wearing woollen socks can help to keep you warm throughout the night - unlike cotton, wool is an great insulator and retains heat. And even better, wool has anti-bacterial properties meaning your cosy socks are odour resistant. Get movingExercising in the late-afternoon and early-evening can help to boost your body’s circulation and body temperature. However, it’s important to steer clear of exercise in the hour before bed, so as to avoid this having an impact on your sleep. googletag.cmd.push Say no to a night-capNot only does alcohol limit the amount of time you spend in REM sleep, the most restorative stage of sleep, it’s been suggested that alcohol can actually contribute to a lower body temperature. This is because alcohol causes your blood vessels to dilate, which takes blood and heat away from the core of your body. If you still want to enjoy a nightcap in the evening, make sure you only have one, and have it as early in the evening as possible to minimise its effects at bedtime. Upgrade your TOGIt goes without saying that investing in a thick, cosy duvet is important to staying warm during the winter nights. As a rule of thumb, a winter duvet should have a tog rating of . – . However, it’s also worth considering the filling.Wool-filled duvets can be quite chunky, making a good choice the cold nights. However, there are also synthetic duvets which are manufactured from fibres that are designed keep you warm while you sleep, which can be a great choice for those looking for hypo-allergenic options.

Waterworth promptly stepped up and fired Linfield into the lead.That lead was doubled within minutes as Stute caved in completely. Brogans initial effort was tipped over by Brown, but from the corner, Waterworth flicked on and Haughey turned the bal home from close range to make it -. It should have been - by the half time break, but again Brown came to the rescue, denying Cooper who should ahve scored, but regardless, Linfield were comfortable at the break, whilst Stute had a huge mountain to climb. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The chances just kept coming for Linfield as Lavery broke clear on goal but with just Brown to beat he shot wide. Stute then had the woodwork to thank for keeping the score down as Millars delivery was met by Haughey but his weffort bounced back off the post into Browns arms.There was little sign of any come back from Stute and the chances con tinued to come for the home side who were proving wasteful in front of goal, as Waterworth went one on one with Brown only for the Stute goalkeeper to come out on top again. The third goal eventually did come and the superb Cooper created it as he raced away from his marker before cutting the ball back to substitute Jordan Stewart, whose close range strike was outstandingly kept out by Brown, but Lavery was on hand to turn home the loose ball in from close range. Institute take a break from league action when they host Dungannon Swts at the Brandywell in the Irish Cup this weekend. The teams palayed out an entertaining - draw when Swts lasted visited Stute last month.

Waterworth promptly stepped up and fired Linfield into the lead.That lead was doubled within minutes as Stute caved in completely. Brogans initial effort was tipped over by Brown, but from the corner, Waterworth flicked on and Haughey turned the bal home from close range to make it -. It should have been - by the half time break, but again Brown came to the rescue, denying Cooper who should ahve scored, but regardless, Linfield were comfortable at the break, whilst Stute had a huge mountain to climb. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The chances just kept coming for Linfield as Lavery broke clear on goal but with just Brown to beat he shot wide. Stute then had the woodwork to thank for keeping the score down as Millars delivery was met by Haughey but his weffort bounced back off the post into Browns arms.There was little sign of any come back from Stute and the chances con tinued to come for the home side who were proving wasteful in front of goal, as Waterworth went one on one with Brown only for the Stute goalkeeper to come out on top again. The third goal eventually did come and the superb Cooper created it as he raced away from his marker before cutting the ball back to substitute Jordan Stewart, whose close range strike was outstandingly kept out by Brown, but Lavery was on hand to turn home the loose ball in from close range. Institute take a break from league action when they host Dungannon Swts at the Brandywell in the Irish Cup this weekend. The teams palayed out an entertaining - draw when Swts lasted visited Stute last month.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race.

As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable. Seals give birth on the beach andyou get stormy weather, tidal surges and high spring tides, high pup vitalities can occur because seals are unable to thermo-regulate properly.ldquoSo,you have calmer conditions pups are going to have a better chance of survival.The mild lough islands of Strangford are a favourite spot for the seals to haul out in large groups, known as rockeries, now a regular sight for boat users.Mr Thurgate, who has worked on Strangford Lough for two decades, has seen the population steadily rise.He said: ldquoWe starting counting seals in .

Whilst these may be regarded by many as ‘great festivals of the church,’ they are as such man-made of late Roman construct, not from the early church. The ‘Church Year’ is also an ecclesiastical invention which quite blatantly blots out the holy calendar of God in Scripture which Jesuswould have kept.Pentecost is a Hellenised way of obscuring the original Old Testament Hebrew link to the commanded festival of Shavuot, or the Feast of Weeks, which was in existence long before the Holy Spirit fell at this ‘appointed time.’ .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button True holy days of God occur and are fulfilled on the exact Hebrew date that God set in place, such as Yeshua’s death on th Nisan, the date of Passover. ‘Easter’ which is named after a fertility goddess focusses more on the Resurrection and the veneration of another day, ‘Sun’-day, named after pagan sun-worship. Christmas as with Easter is an invention of Rome, so although ‘great festivals of the Church,’ we have to ask in these days just who are the True Church and who will be caught up in the apostate church that will ignore God’s commandments in the last days. The Bible is clear that the way to le is narrow and few there be that find it. People will attach themselves to all kinds of sentimental traditions and even try to call them holy days, butthey are of man, we are not obligated to observe them, no matter what arguments are offered in their defence. St Patrick and St Paul never observed such and were able to spread the Gospel fully with much blessing. If the pre-Roman churches managed fine without these new inventions I don’t see why true believers in these perilous times cannot adhere to Biblical truth over all the Roman changes and man-made traditions.You may be vilied by some in religious authority for going against the mainstream, but that’s exactly what Jesus did. He was hated by leaders in the Temple for exposing what was of man and what was of God. We should continue to do that today. As Yeshua said, “They hated Me, and they will hate you also.” That’s religious hatred, not from the sinners.Colin Nevin, Bangor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"jim allister that irish language activists get special treatment of a secretary of state meeting shows the pandering to such interests  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.
