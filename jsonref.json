They may have stopped recruiting patients because the risk of Covid-19 infection in hospitals was too high.Some 10 per cent  - 1,500 - were shut down all together.It is unclear currently the exact reasons why they stop, but could be because the research was time sensitive or there was not enough resources to wait, for example.  Dr Head told MailOnline: \u0027I guess looking back and reflecting, the numbers are not surprising. The pandemic has taken the world by surprise. \u0027We\u0027ve shown globally and in the uk we are not prepared. And that will impact on research. \u0027Research is directed towards covid-19, which is necessary. But obviously that will impact on other areas of health. In terms of preparedness for the future, we need to make sure non-Covid types of research are in planning.\u0027The research is ongoing and so it is unclear exactly what areas have been impacted the most. This will become clearer over the next few months.Dr Head said: \u0027It might be that cancer research was not affected but stroke and mental health was. It won\u0027t just be large diseases, but areas of health with few cases.\u0027There will be research impacted that what will be rare or orphan diseases, where there isn\u0027t much treatment available. \u0027Aspects of that might include motor neurone disease or haemophilia. If they are impacted it might hard for those charities to carry on.\u0027He added that it will be important to discover what knowledge would have been found had Covid-19 not halted medical research.These \u0027knowledge gaps\u0027 will be important for moving forward in the treatment of patients, he said.Dr Head told The Observer: \u0027This pandemic has knocked everything off track. Research gives us the knowledge we need to tackle illnesses in new ways, and if that doesn\u0027t happen all areas of health will suffer.\u0027 A stark example of the harm caused to medical research by the pandemic is to cancer research, as large charities reveal the devastation in stark numbers.  \u0027We had planned to spend £400m on research this year. That figure will have to be cut to £250m,\u0027 Aoife Regan of Cancer Research UK told the Observer.\u0027That is £150m of research on treatments with the potential to save or lengthen lives that will not now take place.\u0027If cuts continue to persist for four or five more years, it would mean hundreds of millions of pounds will be stripped from cancer research in the UK in coming years which will \u0027send ripples beyond that\u0027. The impact of Covid-19 on cancer patients has been at the forefront of discussions during the pandemic. Today, Dame Laura Lee, the CEO of cancer charity Maggie\u0027s, said the past few months have been a difficult time for cancer patients.Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, she said: \u0027It\u0027s been hugely difficult. Cancer is not just a physical illness but it\u0027s the psychological effects that has not just on the person but also the family.\u0027With auto treatments and on many occasions treatment being ceased, people with cancer dying during this period, or finding that their disease has progressed, it\u0027s been a heightened time of distress and anxiety.\u0027Cancer always brings anxiety, a sense of aloneness, but during this Covid time, it\u0027s been higher than ever. \u0027People are coming into our centres with that knowledge and information of what they\u0027ve heard and worrying, \u0027what does that mean for me?\u0027\u0027Our centre staff have never said they\u0027ve ever dealt with such level of distress, feelings of anger, about the situation they find themselves in and actually, to a certain extent, feelings of abandonment with the NHS as well.\u0027 Shannon Amoils, of the British Heart Foundation, said its research had \u0027ground to a halt\u0027 during the pandemic. A study at Edinburgh University was set to determine if specific drugs could prevent stroke patients from going on to develop vascular dementia. Another study at Newcastle University aimed to find out if non-invasive treatments could be used instead of surgical interventions for elderly men and women who had suffered heart attacks. Brian Dickie, of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, warned time was critical for the research of motor neuron diseases - which affect about 5,000 people in the UK.He said: \u0027Around 50 per cent of people with motor neurone disease will die within 18 months of their first diagnosis.\u0027Work to determine whether a drug called Tudca could stop the disease progressing is among the suspended trials.Dr Dickie said: \u0027These iniduals are rapidly running out of time, so suspending projects like these is utterly heartbreaking.\u0027    The British Lung Foundation said in May it had had to pause a phase two clinical trial for new drugs to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma.The condition has no cure and just five per cent of men and 10 per cent of women survive for more than five years.Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, told The Telegraph: \u0027This is not good news for a cancer where survival rates are dismal and there is no cure.\u0027We completely understand the need to focus on Covid-19 right now, but the impact will be colossal, with huge repercussions on the research community and patients who, heartbreakingly, don\u0027t have time to spare. This will mean delays in the trial going ahead and any potential new treatments reaching those who need them.\u0027Michael Lauer, deputy director for extramural research at the US National Institutes of Health, said the effect of Covid-19 on medical research goes beyond just trials.In a article for The Lancet last week, he said: \u0027There have also been tremendous disruptive effects on all biomedical research that is not directly related to Covid.\u0027Laboratories are closed. Communications have been shut down, conferences have been cancelled, supply chains for equipment have been lost, resources have been lost. There have been widespread financial losses within academic medical centres that have had spillover effects on their research operations.\u0027 Thousands of clinical trials halted amid focus on finding coronavirus treatments"},{"url":null,"title":"No10 urges workers tell bosses want come office amid home working surge","story":"Share this article \u0027What is clear is that there will be more working from home, we will see more flexible work arrangements.\u0027 Earlier this month it was revealed fewer British office workers have returned to their workplace than in any other major European country.Little more than a third (34 per cent) of UK staff were back at their desks, with the remainder continuing to work from home.This contrasted with 83 per cent of French office staff and 70 per cent of Germans, according to a survey by researchers at investment bank Morgan Stanley.However, their analysis found that Britons who have returned to their offices are doing so for more days a week than continental rivals.Almost half (46 per cent) of UK workers who have returned are working at least five days a week from their office, far more than in France, Germany, Italy or Spain.The figures come amid a high street bloodbath with retailers experiencing massively reduced footfall.Subscribe to read | Financial Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f29d61c10cc02ba03dfab64d8783edcc6a9971/0_393_5930_3560/master/5930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7efad45dc4cb5fa856f2a4424be1a30","title":"loved and lost simon bray photo essay","story":"Photographer Simon Bray’s project Loved and Lost deals with the loss of loved ones. He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8829c9aaceee8d7d6c89ad59f8993f368775fa8f/0_198_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12c27d0ee1dbfff0a5410a1215374c8","title":"the big picture a tender family moment with jfk","story":"A candid shot of the young senator by Life magazine’s Ed Clark portrayed him as a man to lead a new generation into a new decadeEd Clark, a Life magazine staff photographer, was commissioned to photograph the Kennedy family at home in Georgetown in 1958. JFK was campaigning to be elected to a second term as Massachusetts’s senator and, if successful, there were strong rumours that he would make a run for the presidency in 1960. After several days taking pictures of husband and wife, Clark asked over lunch at the house if he could get a picture of the senator with his baby daughter, Caroline. “Jackie said no,” he recalled, “that she was upstairs asleep. But Jack bounded up the stairs, and I followed.”Clark took a spontaneous roll of film up in the nursery. It included this picture capturing the moment Caroline woke up, wide-eyed with delight to see her father. The nation was starting to share that excitement. Clark’s cover story for Life did much to advance the growing conviction that Kennedy was a leader for a new generation and a new decade. Up until that moment, presidents were far more likely to be grandparents than new dads, and family photographs were largely awkwardly staged compositions.Clark, who was based in Tennessee, had made his name in the aftermath of war, photographing the Nuremberg trials, and the bombed-out ruins of Germany and France. In 1962, aged only 51 and at the height of his powers, he was forced to give up his career at Life because of failing eyesight. A new surgical procedure partly restored his vision in 1980 and he returned to photography for the remaining 20 years of his life. The picture of Caroline Kennedy in her crib is included in a new book taken from the photographer’s personal archive. When he became president, JFK hung Clark’s picture in pride of place in the Oval Office Jackie purchased 75 prints.

Impatient, he cursed at first, but mended Being anointed and all though a heavenlier heart began some Months earlier, since I had our sweet reprieve and ransom Tendered to him. Ah well, God rest him all road ever he offended!This seeing the sick endears them to us, us too it endears. My tongue had taught thee comfort, touch had quenched thy tears, Thy tears that touched my heart, child, Felix, poor Felix RandalHow far from then forethought of, all thy more boisterous years,When thou at the random grim forge, powerful amidst peers,Didst fettle for the great grey drayhorse his bright and battering sandal!Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote this poem in 1880 to commemorate the death of Felix Spencer, a Liverpudlian farrier who died from pulmonary tuberculosis. The suggestion that the name-change from Spencer to Randal alludes to the ballad Lord Randal is an interesting one: Lord Randal was poisoned by his sweetheart, while Felix Randal fell foul of the toxic environment of poverty. But it’s equally likely that the serendipitous rhyme with “sandal” might have occurred to the poet as he played with possibilities.Hopkins presents his priest’s role as a great deal more significant than the “duty” remarked in the first line. That casual twist of the sentence into a question - “O is he dead then?” - conceals the strength of the reaction, as if an embryonic lament (“O Felix Randal the farrier is dead!”) had been revised to a coolly surprised comment to a colleague. But this effect is momentary, before the steep plunge into impassioned personal recollections. A doubled lamentation, “Pining, pining…”, seemingly extends from the broken-spirited parishioner to the mourner.The emotions driving the poem are complex. Physical admiration, possibly attraction, is clearly present in the second line with its unexpected alliterative jolts – “his mould of man, big-boned and hardy-handsome”. Alliteration is a Hopkins signature, of course, but it seems especially resonant in this poem - plainly audible, but never intrusive. One reason must be the accentual syllabic meter that carries the sonnet along almost in defiance of Petrarchan symmetry, allowing echo-room in the extended line for all those sound effects. More importantly, it’s rooted in context emotional turmoil as well as the noise and heat of the farrier’s days “at the random grim forge” are implied.Hopkins knows exactly when to flatten and simplify his diction. Again in the second stanza, as in the poem’s first line, the tone is quieter, more detached: “Sickness broke him. Impatient, he cursed at first, but mended Being anointed and all…” The qualifier “and all” has a colloquial flavor, at least for modern readers – as does “all road” in the fourth line, meaning “any way”. There’s a very subtle hint that Felix Randal’s own idiom has infiltrated the voice of the narrator. On the other hand, the priest seems to be speaking in the drier commentary of the ninth line: “This seeing the sick endears them to us, us too it endears.The Holy Sacraments deliver salvation, and the poem emphasizes their transformative effects on the parishioner, the learning of what is so gracefully phrased as “a heavenlier heart”. At the same time, the priest is fatherly in a literal way in lines 10 and 11, there’s a direct tenderly empathetic voiced addressed to “child, Felix, poor Felix Randal” .Hopkins welds priest, father and perhaps doctor into his persona. The reference to the “fatal four disorders” suggests a medical diagnosis based on the ancient concept of the four humours: it was thought necessary that the four – blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm - remain in balance to ensure human health. In its symbols and textures, the poem seems at times a synthesis of the four elements - fire, air, earth and water – that were said to correspond to the humours.

The group operates 73 gyms and 75 shops across the UK.Frasers Group, which also owns Sports Direct, House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Flannels, is to pay an initial cash consideration of £37m for “certain assets” of the business. The overall deal, which excludes the DW business names and intellectual property, could be boosted by up to a further £6.9m, depending upon how many of the property lease holdings Frasers Group acquires.The company said it was “pleased to have saved a number of jobs” but did not say how many employees would be retained with the business.Sports Direct said it intended to run the business using its Everlast brand, the American boxing kit manufacturer made famous by Muhammad Ali, which the business acquired in 2007 for $168m.“The transaction complements the existing gym and fitness club portfolio within the company’s group and is consistent with the group’s elevation strategy,” the company said. “Frasers Group looks forward to elevating the gym and fitness assets acquired … under the group’s existing Everlast brand.”Marks \u0026amp Spencer – 7,000 jobs18 August: Food, clothing and homewares retailer cuts jobs in central support centre, regional management and stores.M\u0026ampCo – 400 jobs5 August: M\u0026ampCo, the Renfrewshire-based clothing retailer, formerly known as Mackays, will close 47 of 215 stores.WH Smith – 1,500 jobs5 August: The chain, which sells products ranging from sandwiches to stationery, will cut jobs mainly in UK railway stations and airports.\u0026nbspPizza Express – 1,100 jobs4 August: The restaurant chain plans the closure of 70 restaurants as part of a rescue restructure deal.Dixons Carphone – 800 jobs4 August: Electronics retailer Dixons Carphone is cutting 800 managers in its stores as it continues to reduce costs.DW Sports – 1,700 jobs at risk3 August: DW Sports fell into administration, closing its retail website immediately and risking the closure of its 150 gyms and shops.Marks \u0026amp Spencer – 950 jobs20 July: The high street stalwart cuts management jobs in stores as well as head office roles related to property and store operations.Ted Baker – 500 jobs19 July: About 200 roles to go at the fashion retailer’s London headquarters, the Ugly Brown Building, and the remainder at stores.Azzurri – 1,200 jobs17 July: The owner of the Ask Italian and Zizzi pizza chains closes 75 restaurants and makes its Pod lunch business delivery onlyBurberry – 500 jobs worldwide15 July: Total includes 150 posts in UK head offices as luxury brand tries to slash costs by £55m after a slump in sales during the pandemic.John Lewis – 1,300 jobs9 July: John Lewis announced that it is planning to\u0026nbsppermanently close eight of its 50 stores, including full department stores in Birmingham and Watford, with the likely loss of 1,300 jobs.Celtic Manor – 450 jobs9 July: Bosses at the Celtic Collection in Newport, which staged golf\u0027s Ryder Cup in 2010 and the 2014 Nato Conference, said 450 of its 995 workers will lose their jobs.Pret a Manger – 1,000 jobs6 July: Pret a Manger is to\u0026nbsppermanently close 30 branches and could cut at least 1,000 jobs after suffering “significant operating losses” as a result of the Covid-19 lockdownCasual Dining Group – 1,900 jobs2 July: The owner of the Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas restaurant chains\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration, with the immediate loss of 1,900 jobs.

propose face masks and bouncer patrols to reopen covid","story":"Owners say 750,000 jobs at risk in night-time industries unless government supports sectorDancing in face masks, temperature checks at the door and bouncers patrolling the dancefloor to enforce social distancing could be the future of clubbing during a pandemic, according to plans put forward by venues desperate to reopen.Nightclub owners have warned they face imminent “financial armageddon”, putting more than 750,000 jobs at risk, unless the government provides them with support or greater certainty about when they can reopen.While ministers have so far refused to allow late-night venues to reopen, a group of them has drawn up plans that they say would reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission to the “lowest practicable level”.Proposals written by the Institute of Occupational Medicine for the nightclub industry include ID scans for clubbers to assist with test and trace, and thermal monitoring to measure their temperature.“Use of face coverings on the dancefloor can be implemented and enforced through existing security staff and protocols,” the report adds.The plans, in a report commissioned by nightclubs, late-night bars and music venues, also envisage security staff regulating the number of people on the dancefloor at any one time and enforcing physical distancing requirements.The industry pointed out that some of its venues are larger than pubs, restaurants and other venues that have been allowed to open, while they often recycle air more frequently with powerful mechanical ventilation systems.They also pledged more intense and frequent cleaning regimes, meaning sticky dancefloors could become a thing of the past.The report, coordinated by the Night-Time Industries Association (NTIA), claims that closely monitored clubbing would be safer than unlicensed events where Covid-19 protocols are not in place.“Bearing in mind the behaviour we are witnessing in unregulated environments such as beaches, parks and raves, there is a strong argument to permit clubs to reopen, albeit under strict controls flowing from government guidance and inidual risk assessments informed by other sectors,” it said.The industry warned that the growing number of illegal raves that have sprung up during the pandemic “put those who attend them in danger, waste precious emergency services time and contribute to regional outbreaks of Covid-19”.Nightclub operators are “verging on insolvency”, the NTIA said, and many will not survive without some form of controlled reopening.Peter Marks, the chief executive of Deltic Group, the UK’s largest operator of late-night bars and clubs, said: “The late-night leisure sector, a sector which employs tens of thousands across the UK, is at risk of collapse if the government does not act now – it is that simple.“Despite the government’s furlough scheme continuing until the end of October, we will see the loss of a third of jobs across the sector by the end of September, the majority of which are young adults.“We need a clear reopening plan, or at the very least fit-for-purpose financial assistance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b44728201ad03cb3e62ec76c1e330e6188a1ad/0_148_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2d1a21c0eec21317baa9d1dbbfc8026","title":"global stock markets coronavirus covid 19 business live","story":"Rolling live coverage of business, economics and financial markets More than half the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico have shut down ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, wiping about 1 million barrels of oil a day in oil production from the US.However, the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy and oil demand has kept a lid on the market’s gains. Artem Abramov, an analyst at Rystad Energy, said the Gulf shutdowns are “not unique” for this time of year, and are “typically factored in by the market before the start of hurricane season”.In normal years the market impact of the shutdowns would have been greater, according to Rystad’s head of oil markets, Bjornar Tonhaugen.Oil traders may be seizing the opportunity to trade at slightly higher prices, but Tonhaugen said that the oil market will struggle to break above the $45 a barrel mark while Covid-19 continues to sap demand for transport fuels.“It would take either a significant change in production or an unlikely collapse of the pandemic,” he added. It reflects a general positive mood on global stock markets after the US approved a blood plasma treatment for Covid-19. In the absence of much other data investors are in risk-on mode. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, a spreadbetting company, said:European markets have kicked off the week in style, with the FDA’s decision to approve the convalescent plasma coronavirus treatment raising hopes that we could see a vaccine fast-tracked before long. With the US election looming large for Donald Trump, we are likely to continue seeing a proactive approach from the president as he seeks to expedite the provision of treatments and vaccines in a bid to overcome this virus before the polls open in November. Rio Tinto executives will pay for the destruction of an Aboriginal heritage site in Australia - but they will still keep their jobs.Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques has lost almost $5m in bonuses and the head of Rio Tinto’s Australian iron ore group will lose more than $1m over the destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site at Juukan Gorge, after an internal review found “systemic failures in the cultural heritage management system”.The mining company destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 24 May, despite having received five separate reports on the significance of the sites, both archeologically and to the local Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people, since 2013.You can read the full report here:With two bits of good news for the retail sector, should we be counting on a V-shaped recovery for the economy?At first glance, the Springboard footfall figures are support that impression, according to James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, an investment bank. However, dig a little deepper and the numbers “reveal consumers are still cautious about returning to the high street”.He gives three reasons why caution is warranted about interpreting the figures:Tesco is permanently hiring 16,000 extra staff taken on during the pandemic to help support a surge in online grocery trade.The roles include 10,000 pickers, who select and pack grocery orders for home delivery, and 3,000 drivers as well as a variety of other jobs in stores and distribution centres.The UK’s biggest supermarket said it had already hired 4,000 other permanent staff since the start of the pandemic, during which it hired more than 20,000 temporary workers to help out.The supermarket is expecting Tesco online sales of £5.5bn this year, up from £3.3bn last year. Tesco UK and Ireland chief executive Jason Tarry said:Since the start of the pandemic, our colleagues have helped us to more than double our online capacity, safely serving nearly 1.5m customers every week and prioritising vulnerable customers to ensure they get the food they need.These new roles will help us continue to meet online demand for the long term, and will create permanent employment opportunities for 16,000 people across the UK.Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said:It seems that the increased quarantine measures imposed last week on a number of overseas destinations are having a positive impact on UK footfall. Footfall in UK retail destinations last week not only rose on a week on week basis, but the uplift was more than four times as large as the week before, and two and a half times as large as the same week last year.The outcome is a further incremental recovery in footfall compared with 2019, and the sixteenth consecutive week in which the annual decline has lessened which offers a glimmer of hope for retailers.If the UK had Dominic Cummings’s Barnard Castle eye test, Ireland has perhaps outdone it with “golfgate”, a controversy that has already claimed a minister and has the EU’s powerful trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, under serious pressure.Hogan, who plays a key role in trade talks including on Brexit, yesterday apologised for attending the 80-person dinner - contravening social distancing rules - but has made it clear he doesn’t want to resign. It also emerged that police had cautioned him for using a phone while driving.However, the pressure is mounting. European Commission prseident Ursula von der Leyen has asked him to report to her, and Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Monday called on Hogan to clarify how he did not breach lockdown rules.Martin on Monday said Hogan needed to give a full account of his movements through locked down Country Kildare, given there was a discrepancy between the commissioner’s public statements on the issue, according to Reuters.“I need absolute ... the public needs absolute assurances that the restrictions that were imposed in Kildare were not breached. That to me would be very, very serious indeed,” Martin, who called for Hogan to consider his position on Saturday, told national broadcaster RTE.Bunzl, a distributor of products such as medical supplies and food packaging, is the second biggest riser on the FTSE 100 (after BT) after reinstating its idend.The company felt comfortable giving payouts to investors again after demand for facemasks and other hygiene supplies pushed up profits.However, it is one of the few companies giving income investors a reason to go to work: overall the amount paid out by big companies to their investors plummeted between April and June as firms cancelled or cut their idends to conserve cash during the coronavirus pandemic crisis. Analysts at the asset manager Janus Henderson studied idends paid by the world’s 1,200 largest companies, and found the largest quarterly drop in their global idend index since its creation at the end of 2009 following the global financial crisis.

On Friday he wrote a blog post calling for himself to be appointed as chief executive of the lender’s parent company, while keeping on newly appointed chief executive Glen Crawford as head of the lending subsidiary, Amigo Loans Ltd.Amigo was built by Benamor to target poorer customers who might not otherwise be able to gain credit. It allows friends or relatives of borrowers to stand as guarantor, which the company argues widens access to finance. However, the sector has faced heavy criticism for its high-cost loans and regulators have clamped down, causing the share price to tumble.Benamor said he wanted to move Amigo towards areas not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, but Amigo on Monday said Benamor’s return would result in Crawford’s immediate resignation.Mr Crawford has made it clear to the board that he is not prepared to work with Amigo in any circumstances where Mr Benamor returns to Amigo’s governance structure in a position of influence, and that Mr Crawford’s decision to return as CEO was predicated on the clear statement from Mr Benamor that he was selling down Richmond Group Limited’s controlling shareholding in Amigo to a position of zero.In the event that Mr Benamor elects to requisition a general meeting for shareholders to vote on his proposals, and should he be successful in gaining shareholder approval for his proposals, the board has agreed with Mr Crawford that he may terminate his employment contract immediately. The board is strongly of the view that such an outcome would be materially detrimental to the interests of the company and its shareholders taken as a whole.Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group will use the newly purchased Dave Whelan Sports gyms to expand its Everlast fitness brand, it said on Monday.Frasers, which was formerly named Sports Direct after the most successful part of the business, will pay £37m in cash for some parts of DW Sports, but it will not own the brand of the sports retail and gyms business, which collapsed at the start of the month.It is part of Ashley’s strategy to move the company more upmarket - a so-called “elevation” strategy - having initially built the business around cheap sports gear at Sports Direct.The final price could rise by £6.9m depending on how many leaseholds the company ends up buying.Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets.Stock markets in Asia have risen across the board, with investor optimism at least in part ascribed to new hopes around coronavirus treatment options.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the regulator of treatments in the US, on Sunday granted “emergency use authorisation” to a method that uses the blood plasma of recovered patients to fight the virus.The FDA cited early evidence suggesting blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve the health of patients.US President Donald Trump hailed the decision, which represents a boost ahead of the Republican party’s convention. Trump welcomed the treatment on Sunday night with characteristic bombast:This is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time. Today I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives.In UK corporate news, Mike Ashley’s Frasers has bought parts of retailer DW Sports out of administration for £37m - suggesting the retail magnate’s appetite for acquisition has not dimmed even during the pandemic.It is a very quiet late August day on the data front, with only the Chicago Fed’s national activity index at 1:30pm BST with any potential for nudging the market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa58181bacd23d8da933f26e519e25bc4c7d647f/0_446_4851_2913/master/4851.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d5411f2649705bc7766554e25e344671","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are readily available alternatives,” he said.“The Exxons and Chevrons of the world are holding us back,” he added. “This initial move does not mean that BP, Shell, Equinor and other oil and gas majors can rest easy and continue with business as usual, even though they are performing relatively better than US oil majors.”ExxonMobil lobbyists met key European commission officials in an attempt to water down the European Green Deal in the weeks before it was agreed, according to climate lobbying watchdog InfluenceMap.Saugestad said he expects Storebrand’s investor peers will follow its lead in esting from companies that support anti-climate lobbying “as part of a logical progression in global fossil fuel estment”.InfluenceMap has previously found that five of the largest listed oil companies – including Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total – spend about $200m a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change.The analysis found that BP spent the most on lobbying activities. The company successfully lobbied US policymakers to weaken a landmark environmental law, clearing the way for new projects, such as oil pipelines and power plants, to move forward with far less federal review of their environmental impact.Under BP’s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, the company has undertaken a major review of its lobby group memberships and severed ties with three associations because of disagreements over their climate-related policies and activities. It has also set ambitious climate targets for the next 10 years, and to 2050."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d291a14eb4cb04550b8355337b0d86ed3a84723d/100_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31eef4c6a50e4e54bc4d2a4f0603abc1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos including rescued pangolins and hyacinth macaws"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/639d371663f34de53c99c083318dd9bb81384d03/104_178_2896_1738/master/2896.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0d0b77606a8205764bae37ab137b3542","title":"uk wine boxes bagnums bottle lockdown","story":"So called ‘bagnums’ and wine boxes prove popular as Britons minimise trips to the supermarket From so-called “bagnums” to “cardbordeaux”, bag-in-box wines have enjoyed a sales surge in the UK during lockdown as Britons opted for better value for money and fewer trips to the supermarket.Amid the easing of lockdown the boom in UK camping and picnicking is now helping to drive sales, as consumers have recognised the portability, convenience and eco-credentials of the new-style products. The packaging means little oxygen enters even once it has been opened, so wine stays fresher for longer – up to six weeks – than in a bottle.The Co-op has bolstered its 12 bag-in-box range (which includes Fairtrade red and white) by an additional six wines in order to meet demand, and is currently trialling a premium dry rosé. Sarah Benson, wine buyer at Co-op, said people were buying into boxed wine because they could get more in a single purchase and it allowed customers to share the wine among a wider group than a smaller bottle. M\u0026ampS winemaker Belinda Kleinig said: “Pouches have definitely gone upmarket: as packaging technology has improved, so too has wine quality, and customers are now happy to bring out their pouches at picnics and parties.”“Lockdown gave bag-in-box wine a real opportunity to shine,” said Sainsbury’s wine buyer Hugh Browne. “Shoppers could get the same great taste in a larger container that kept their wine fresh for six weeks from opening, with fewer trips to the shops.”The tipple is attracting a more erse customer base as more brands enter the market and quality has increased, said Tesco. The company also highlighted the appeal of its eco-credentials – it’s more environmentally friendly than transporting glass bottles.

Since 2011, they have regularly trained in Qatar, an emirate with a highly questionable human rights record, and in 2018 they signed a sponsorship deal with its state-owned airline. And somehow, their win represented a victory for the good guys.At least, though, it wasn’t a victory for Paris Saint-Germain, a club owned by Qatar. It wasn’t, yet, an all-out victory for sportswashing. As states use football as an arm of foreign policy, the reality of what the sport is being used to occlude should never be forgotten.Although there have been much-trumpeted reforms of labour laws, how much practical change there has been is debatable. The kafala system of visa sponsorship, which effectively gives employers the power to prevent their workers changing jobs or leaving the country, remains in place for those in the military, public and domestic sectors. Qatar has persistently refused to reveal how many migrant workers have died during the construction of World Cup stadiums.Qatar may be more liberal than many other Gulf states, but women’s rights remain severely restricted. Women can marry only with the express consent of a male , only men have unilateral right of orce, female siblings get half the inheritance their brothers get and domestic violence and marital rape are not criminalised. Homosexuality remains a crime. In 2018, the Doha edition of the New York Times featured nine blank pages where reports on gay and transgender rights had been excised.In terms of the success of the sportswashing project, it may not matter that PSG lost. While the Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, would no doubt like to pose with the cup, it’s probably not necessary. The club president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, said after the semi-final victory that since the takeover in 2011 “the Champions League has been our dream”, but when Qatari Sports Investment bought the club its stated goal was more modest: to have “a great team and a strong brand on the international scene”.It certainly has that and if it was going to lose to anybody in the final, it may as well be another club with Qatari links – so much that Qatar Airlines could promote the final as the “Qlassico”. Sunday was a great day for club-branded retail outlets at Doha’s Hamad International Airport.PSG are not going away. They remain one of European football’s mega-brands. They will be there if the expanded Club World Cup manages to find itself a slot in the increasingly crowded calendar (and Fifa will have been heartened as it looks to establish that tournament by the success of the World Cup-style format over the past fortnight). If a super league is ever established, they will be a part of it.For those super-clubs, the nature of the modern Champions League is a little like pass-the-parcel. Sooner or later there will be a season when there is no side obviously better than the others, or when that side suffer ill-fortune at a key moment, and when that happens being there is enough: sooner or later the music will stop with the prize in their hands. PSG aren’t going to stop being invited to the party any time soon.But this is about more than wealth. In two years under Thomas Tuchel, there has been a clear evolution. It’s not wrong to look at the £1bn expenditure on transfer fees alone and wonder whether the heap of devalued domestic silverware was worth it, but the side that lost to Bayern on Sunday were a world away from the rabble that lost 3-2 at Anfield last season.Neymar remains the centrepiece of the project. He has seemed notably more mature this season and had a decisive influence in both quarter- and semi-finals. He has become one of those issue players about whom debate is soon lost in the froth of the backlash against the backlash against the backlash so the discussion becomes about the discussion rather than about his performances. He is a superstar footballer yet a pawn of Qatari foreign policy and an icon of patriotic Brazilian expectation and that must bring intolerable pressure. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200824-28141-gnl.fw.20200823.sj.fw2308.mp3 There was one extravagant scream and writhe, and a classic late booking for a petulant foul, sure signs of a game going against him, but most significant, perhaps, was that for all his effort, all his defensive running, Neymar didn’t make a single successful tackle or interception. It’s perhaps not an entirely fair comparison given Bayern are probably the best pressing side in the world, but Thomas Müller regained possession more than the PSG front three put together.And again, perhaps, it’s reasonable to wonder whether given PSG’s enormous advantages over the rest of Ligue Un, and their consequent lack of practice against teams with any hope of challenging them, that pressing from the front can ever be improved. The result was to increase the pressure on the midfield and it’s no coincidence that Leandro Paredes and Ander Herrera, exhausted as Bayern began to exert control in the second half, were the first to be withdrawn.What really cost PSG, though, was the departure of Thomas Meunier for Borussia Dortmund at the end of the domestic season, which exposed the relatively inexperienced Thilo Kehrer to the runs of Coman. When Tuchel spoke of further investment, full-back surely is an area that will be prioritised.For PSG, of course, even amid a pandemic there is plenty of money for further signings. The wealth of Qatar is not quite infinite, but it is more than enough for funds to remain available as more traditional revenue streams dry up. The superclubs will continue to dominate, and those with the might of states behind them are less susceptible to the changing winds of the sport’s finances than the rest. For PSG, Sunday’s defeat was a dream not ended but deferred."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8be1f036e9325f8b4352741fbe2e56e106f1f8c0/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4944e100ed61d35e2d9481df23663831","title":"how the pandemic gave me my time back laura lippmann","story":"From dressing up to writing a novel to starting a family film festival, author Laura Lippmann says the pandemic gave her the gift of timeI was on deadline – technically, past deadline – when my state imposed a stay-at-home order in March. Suddenly, my 10-year-old daughter was home full-time instead of at school all day. It should have been a recipe for disaster.Back in the 1990s, I had written seven novels in seven years while a full-time reporter at the Baltimore Sun. This meant waking at 6am and working steadily for two hours. I had calculated that if I wrote a minimum of 1,000 words daily, I could have a draft in three months, then nine months to revise. I treated my time as people are advised to handle their paychecks if they wish to save money: I paid myself first. When I arrived at my day job at 9.30am, my work on my novel had been banked, so I could throw myself whole-heartedly into whatever life at the newspaper brought me. I liked both my jobs, but when I was finally lucky enough to risk life as a full-time novelist, I realized how exhausting it had been to juggle the two. In fact, I often wondered if all that work had cost me my first marriage.Yet there I was at my dining room table in the spring of 2020, having traveled full circle, only my day job now involved supervising my daughter’s virtual classroom, thanks to Covid. I got up at 5am and worked until my daughter rose at 8. In this way, I not only finished my novel by 1 June, I found myself awash in time. The 24 hours that had never seemed enough a few months earlier was now an interest-bearing account that kept producing unexpected idends.In part, I was rich with time because the pandemic forced efficiency on areas of my life where I had been wildly profligate. Take grocery shopping and meal planning. Because I live in a walkable urban neighborhood, in the before time I often went to grocery stores three, four times a week. Now I sat down on Sunday mornings, made a plan for the week, then went to a small store I chose for its superior butcher counter and cozy size. I was in and out in 30 minutes and that task, which had eaten up hours a week in my previous life, was done. Bonus: My family, which had been used to going to restaurants two or three times weekly, was eating healthier, homecooked meals and I became a better cook.Thrown together every night – no tennis lessons for me, no art class for my daughter, no work gigs for my spouse or me – we started a family film festival. The rules were simple: we took turns picking movies and no one could veto another’s choice or even complain about it. In that way, we watched older classics, such as My Darling Clementine, and modern ones like Paddington 2. How my heart swelled when my daughter selected Some Like it Hot on her night, how joyful I was when she said at the end of the original The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3, “That is a perfect movie.”And still there was time. Tantalized by a Twitter challenge thrown out by New Yorker writer Rachel Syme, I began dressing up every day, styling my hair, putting on make-up, taking selfies and posting them to my feed, often with the stories behind the outfits. In my pre-pandemic life, I often wore workout clothes from morning to night, going from sweats to pajamas. Now I plumbed the riches of my closet and, in the most counter-intuitive move possible, reactivated my suspended Rent the Runway subscription so I could experiment with new looks. Superficial as it may sound, this attention to what I wore gave the days a much-needed variety and lifted my spirits. I loved the hour or so I spent fussing with my outfits.And still there was time. My trainer, whom I had seen twice a week, was now doing sessions via Zoom at a lower price. So I opted for three sessions, then worked out on One of Those Bikes two days a week. (I had gone into 2020 with “purchase Peloton” on my resolution list, so please no pandemic Peloton shaming.) Once my book was done, I began using my mornings for long walks, logging at least 7,000 steps by 7 am, listening to podcasts. Already pretty fit, I found myself in the best shape of my life and bursting with endorphins.And still there was time. I began compulsively zhuzhing and decluttering my house. “Isn’t everyone doing this?” I asked my therapist, to whom I now spoke by phone, saving me an hour because I no longer had to drive to and from her office. “No, Laura,” she said, “I think everyone’s talking about doing that.” I made small repairs, I organized closets and cupboards.I realize all of this reeks of privilege, that this is the life of a woman who is not worrying about money or her job. Does it make it better if I admit that despite my attempts to fill my days with positive activities, I wasn’t always happy? In fact, I was often depressed, especially on my daughter’s behalf. I would give anything if I could give her the old world back. I can’t, so instead I choose Hope and Glory for family movie night, hoping she sees the parallels between the pandemic and the blitz.Over the past six months, I have returned to a beloved book by Ruth McKenney, best known for the My Sister Eileen stories. In Love Story, she wrote about her marriage to Richard Brantsen. They were committed Communists and anti-fascists in the 1930s, appalled by world events. But they were not without joy, although the tragic end of their marriage – he committed suicide on her birthday in 1955 – suggests that McKenney left some things out of her love story.I write, I shop, I cook, I work out, I walk, I watch movies, and still there is time. I find myself feeling happy, feel guilty about the happiness and scold myself, but the happiness creeps back. No delphiniums for me to separate, so I take a copy of my just published book of essays, cut up the pages, and decoupage a lampshade for the gussied-up guest room where, I promise my daughter, one day we will have guests again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b564af80296c2636b546a14024c2ffd34da65ee2/323_534_4037_2422/master/4037.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0f02d8668a1bd6c604105c0da6fb82a4","title":"reporting from latin america coronavirus has proved an intensely political story","story":"’s Latin America correspondent reflects on the humanitarian disaster that has gripped the region in recent monthsWhen I set off from Mexico City for Rio with my family in early March, for what was supposed to be a short holiday, Latin America had not recorded a single death from the coronavirus.Security staff at Mexico’s Benito Juárez airport wore face masks. A blue and red banner warned China-bound travellers to wash their hands, cover their mouths and, ominously, avoid contact with “live or death animals”.But Covid-19 still seemed a relatively distant threat that had upended the lives of friends in China but was unlikely to do the same to us. As we boarded our flight that morning we looked forward to seeing Brazilian family and showing our three-year-old son, Santiago, the sea.Five months later Latin America has been shaken by a humanitarian disaster that will inflict years of uncertainty and hardship on a land already in a profound state of flux.More than 200,000 people have died since Covid-19 gripped the region we flew over on our way from Mexico to Brazil, almost entirely oblivious to the coming storm.As the epidemic intensified, our break in Brazil morphed into one of the most draining and disturbing experiences of our lives. Holed up in a small flat in Rio, where the governor had ordered residents to stay at home, we watched in horror as Brazil’s death toll rose from zero to nearly 100,000 in just a few months.“Am-bu-lance! Am-bu-laaaance! Am-bu-laaaaance!” our son would scream excitedly each day as paramedics in full-protective gear sped past our balcony towards a nearby Covid-19 field hospital, sirens blaring.Santi had no way of comprehending the largely hidden catastrophe playing out around us. But as the days and weeks passed, and I worked on my computer trying to fathom Covid’s impact on Brazil and its neighbours, the human toll became all too clear.“The authorities are just leaving us to die,” Eduardo Javier Barrezueta Chávez, a 33-year-old resident of Guayaquil, Ecuador, told me over WhatsApp in early April from his living room, where he was sitting with his father’s decomposing remains.Days later I spoke to Gilson de Freitas, whose mother had just been consigned to a mass grave in the Brazilian city of Manaus. “It’s madness, just madness,” he told me as the city’s health and funeral services collapsed. “What are our lives worth now? Nothing.”Technology was a indispensable ally as I set about reporting Latin America’s coronavirus crisis while trapped under quarantine in Rio.Using WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom and Twitter, I tracked down and interviewed bereaved Brazilian families, Mexican doctors and Venezuelan politicians - all from the relative comfort of my son’s cramped bedroom in our temporary home.In mid-April I sat down at my laptop to speak to Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, himself sheltering in São Paulo, who warned the country’s current leader, Jair Bolsonaro, was “leading citizens to the slaughterhouse” with his reckless Covid response.Lula was right. On the day we spoke Brazil’s confirmed death toll stood at just 1,952. As I write these lines – four months later – it has swelled to more than 100,000, the second highest number in the world after the US. Back in Mexico the situation was also deteriorating, despite claims from its populist president that the virus had been “tamed”. More than 50,000 Mexicans have now died from Covid-19 – the third-worst toll.From the start we knew giving those statistics names and faces had to be a priority.We reported on the life and death of a Brazilian clown, Potato, who had entertained seriously ill children in one Rio hospital before dying there himself.With Caio Barretto Briso, one of the many talented regional stringers contributing to our coverage, we remembered the nurses, samba musicians and favela residents being lost as the pandemic ravaged their country.Other correspondents, from Puerto Ordaz, Buenos Aires and Asunción to Bogotá, Lima, Guadalajara and La Paz, paid witness to the suffering coronavirus has forced on the some of Latin America’s most vulnerable people, including Venezuelan refugees and prisoners, Mexican healthcare workers, Colombian shantytown dwellers, indigenous communities in Brazil and inhabitants of the remote Peruvian Amazon.Coronavirus has proved an intensely political story, as well as a humanitarian one, and perhaps nowhere more so than Brazil. From day one Bolsonaro has played down the epidemic, sparking international outrage, domestic protest and even accusations that he was promoting a genocide.“So what?” the far-right populist snapped as Brazil’s death toll began its inexorable rise. “I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?”As a reporter, covering the political bedlam has been exhausting and perplexing – a ceaseless deluge of fake news and fury. As the father of a young Brazilian as well as British citizen, it has been profoundly dispiriting. What hope for Santi’s South American homeland when its top leader sees tens of thousands of citizens lose their lives and shrugs: “We’ll all die one day”?A ray of light came in July, on one of our last nights in Rio before flights to Mexico resumed, when I fired up Skype for a Friday night chat with the legendary composer Caetano Veloso.Caetano, whose music was among the first things that drew me to Brazil, was crestfallen too. He feared the toxic political atmosphere could bring “great violence” to his country. He feared losing his life to Covid-19 as the epidemic escalated further. He was appalled by Bolsonaro’s foolhardy, anti-scientific response. “I think it’s sick,” the 77-year-old musician said.Yet despite this Caetano insisted he was “scandalously optimistic” about the future.“Pessimism is too convenient,” he said. “Everything that’s happening in the world right now is telling us something.”What it is telling us, none of us could say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

It’s been irrelevant for generations, and we seem to keep perpetuating it.”Nwanoku, a principal bass player in London orchestras for 35 years, founded Chineke! in 2015 to provide career opportunities to established and up-and-coming black, Asian and ethnically erse classical musicians in the UK and Europe. The orchestra made its highly acclaimed Proms debut in 2017.She said if the BBC did not axe Rule Britannia, she would be mortified. “I will feel invisible with my people and our history. If the BBC are talking about Black Lives Matter and their support for the movement, how could you possibly have Rule Britannia as the last concert – in any concert?”Plans are yet to be finalised for the concert on 12 September. The BBC said in a statement: “We are still finalising arrangements for the Last Night of the Proms so that we are able to respond to the latest advice in regards to Covid-19 and deliver the best offering possible for audiences.“We have announced that conductor Dalia Stasevska, soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra will perform at the Last Night of the Proms this year.”Rule Britannia and Land of Hope of Glory were among the “crudely jingoistic texts” singled out for criticism by the classical music critic Richard Morrison in a column for BBC Music Magazine last month. He wrote that given the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic, “there will never be a better moment to drop that toe-curling, embarrassing, anachronistic farrago of nationalistic songs that concludes the Last Night of the Proms.”He added: “In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, it would surely be insensitive, bordering on the incendiary, to roar out these hypocritical 18th-century words, with or without irony.”Morrison’s column led to a backlash, with the Conservative MP Philip Davies dismissing it as “extremist, virtue-signalling views”. News that the future of the anthems was now under debate was criticised as unpatriotic by several prominent pro-Brexit campaigners, including Nigel Farage.The Proms presenter Josie d’Arby told the Times: “This year everyone is thinking about racial equality. The Proms has always done that but … it is upping it out of respect for the current climate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a820bc7efea468cad8ab376871857b5a7dff62/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c73fc2e0f818210694a48b449ec6b081","title":"britney spears request remove father guardianship delayed","story":"The singer’s call to have her father prevented from returning as her conservator will not be reviewed until FebruaryBritney Spears’ request for a court to prevent her father from returning as her conservator will not be decided until February, a California judge has ruled.James P Spears (AKA Jamie Spears) oversaw his daughter’s personal and financial decision-making as well as her healthcare for more than a decade until last year when he stepped down citing health problems.Spears’ lawyer, Samuel D Ingham III, said his client was “strongly opposed” to her father returning to the position, preferring the retention of her temporary conservator, Jodi Montgomery, and that “a qualified corporate fiduciary” such as a bank be put in charge of her estate. Ingham said Spears did not wish to perform for the foreseeable future and floated the possibility that she might “seek termination of this conservatorship in the future”.Through his lawyers, Jamie Spears attempted to bring back his co-conservator, Andrew M Wallet, who voluntarily resigned in March 2019.Judge Brenda Penny extended the conservatorship in its present form until 1 February 2021. She asked Ingham to file Spears’ petition by 18 September and to file any objections by 2 October. The next hearing in the case takes place on 14 October.The closed hearing took place on 19 August in Los Angeles. Supporters from the #FreeBritney movement – which believes the star is being held against her will and being stolen from – gathered outside the courtroom.Jamie rejected the accusations in an interview earlier this month. “All these conspiracy theorists don’t know anything,” he said. “I have to report every nickel and dime spent to the court every year. How the hell would I steal something? … I love my daughter.”Spears’ cause has also attracted support from the American Civil Liberties Union. “People with disabilities have a right to lead self-directed lives and retain their civil rights,” the organisation tweeted last week. “If Britney Spears wants to regain her civil liberties and get out of her conservatorship, we are here to help her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c39aa5a0cf6d3dca96a022a5f07169fec01384b4/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cc847b76b49c0f164dcd7a5fb8b5b352 1320w","title":"my blue passport has arrived and with it a crushing new sense of our brexit nightmare","story":"We definitely are not in the EU any more. No stars, just a lion, a unicorn and a peculiar illustration of the UK. Yet that’s not even the worst thing about this documentIn February, I lost my passport in the stupidest way yet. I was not mugged, pickpocketed or burgled (passports one to three), I did not drop it in a pond (passport four), or lose it in a house move (passport five), I just walked through a station in a bit of a daze, and by the time I got to my platform, it was gone. I tried to self-soothe with the fact that, at least I now had time to renew before the blue ones came in, but that plan did not square with the global pandemic, and the document arrived today, as blue as midnight and also as dark.Some observations: we definitely are not in the EU any more. There are no stars, just a lion, a unicorn and a peculiar and bereft illustration of the UK, with Northern Ireland a floating blob, the rest of the landmass etched out like Trotsky’s face. I don’t know why I should find this so disappointing. Obviously on some subconscious level, I thought it was all a dream, or a joke.The colour, meanwhile, is not the nostalgia kick you might have hoped for, if that was your thing, since it genuinely is blue, while the pre-EU ones looked more like black. This somehow says it all about the Brexit project, that it would fight to the death over a principle that was trivial and wrong. Three flowers and a shamrock are embossed on the back, for poetry I suppose, except the daffodil could be any flower, and the overall effect is of someone finding free graphics on the internet for a superbly boring PowerPoint presentation.Yet by far the worst thing about it was my own photo, as ever, contriving to look meaner and more like Myra Hindley than the last, which was itself the worst picture I had ever taken. Remarkably, and powerfully, this lifted my spirits. Some things never change. Every passport has a worse photo than the last – even, mysteriously, one you lost after only six months. But everything else can change, and who knows, by 2030, the blue years could be over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7099a789ead1e286965b1389bfd4a8b1ce2f7224/0_49_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6d927273a8ea7c4f685d06d3b89001ea","title":"sophia popov holds her nerve and lands first major with the womens open","story":"For Sophia Popov a little piece of history alongside a $675,000 (£515,000) cheque. Victory in the Women’s Open – ultimately so comfortable the scale of her underdog status was easily forgotten – means the 27-year-old becomes the first German to claim a major title on British soil.In the first staging of this championship on the famed Ayrshire links, Popov joins a stellar list – Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson et al – of iconic Troon major winners. Popov was in floods of tears even before tapping in for victory on the 72nd green.That scene only emphasised earlier battles and a life-changing performance. Moments later she walked towards the clubhouse with champagne bottle in hand even golf’s blazer brigade had to nod in approval.This seemed the most unlikely of outcomes. Popov was chasing success in 54-hole competitions on the Cactus Tour in the middle of this year. The very name seems to perfectly articulate that level. She began this week as the world No 304 and without any apparent major credentials whatsoever. She did not even have status on the LPGA Tour. Now, Popov can pick and choose where to play.She started day four holding a three-stroke lead, a supposedly dicey situation for a player unaccustomed to challenging for titles. Popov’s position never looked under serious threat. Her closing 68 meant a two-stroke success, at seven under par overall. Jasmine Suwannapura, the Thai player who like Tiger Woods has rebounded from career-saving back surgery, finished second.“This feels amazing,” said Popov. “There has been a lot of work, there have been a lot of struggles. I knew I was capable, I just had a lot of obstacles in my way. The Women’s Open to me was a bonus. I got here on Tuesday, I knew my game was in good shape and anything was possible. I just took that belief into every round but I never expected this.”If Popov was, quite understandably, never counting on victory, one hole emphasised what was meant to be. Her drive at the 15th appeared destined for one of the treacherous fairway bunkers, with the ball instead scuttling into adjacent rough. Her subsequent iron shot, from an uphill lie, finished 20ft from the hole. With the birdie putt duly converted, she led by four.Only Suwannapura belatedly threatened to spoil the party, thanks to a superb birdie from 40ft on the 16th. Popov responded with another one of her own at the same hole. Suwannapura swung again, collecting another shot at the par-three 17th. Yet the leader knew only a disastrous finish would cost her the first women’s major of 2020. There was no such implosion, nor any suggestion of one. Minjee Lee finished third, at three under.The Sunday scene was perfect. Gone were the gusts that affected the first two rounds, with the coast as close as seemed possible to flat calm.Popov is due immense credit for this nerveless win but one wonders how the elements may have disrupted the mindset of one so unaccustomed to jousting for the top titles. She made bogey from sand at the first but bounced back with three birdies in her next five holes.“I used to be a player who didn’t like to lead so this was a new position,” she said. “I just had belief going into this round. I told myself I was capable of birdies on every hole.”Lydia Ko stood with arms aloft on the 18th green after converting a lengthy putt for par. The celebrations embodied her final day. At three over, the re-emerging New Zealander finished with a share of 14th. Better – much better – is surely to come from the two-times major winner. It would be wise to keep an eye on her during the remainder of this year.So too Inbee Park, whose 66 meant fourth place. “It’s my husband’s first week at a major championship,” she said. “Posting a top-10 finish for him is a really nice thing to do.” Park, Lee, Suwannapura and Popov were the only players to break par.This was a highly successful event and justified the persistence of the R\u0026ampA in staging it. Pace of play, the scourge of golf in recent times, was not an issue at all.Troon responded magnificently at a juncture where a major for the female game had never carried such value. The highest prize of all belongs to Popov. Cactus Tour no more. Eat your heart out, Bernhard Langer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95cc2f4859841c9494073780f99c14bea40347e3/0_265_5803_3479/master/5803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe7eecf7e5bf05bd8f6cd317775e398","title":"takuma sato wins indy 500 scott dixon fernando alonso","story":"Japanese driver Takuma Sato snatched his second Indianapolis 500 victory on Sunday, holding off Scott Dixon before winning under caution at an empty racetrack.Sato denied five-time IndyCar champion Dixon after race officials declined to throw a red flag following a late crash by Spencer Pigot. Fernando Alonso, bidding to complete a “triple crown” having won the Monaco Grand Prix and Le Mans 24 hour race, could only finish in 21st place.Unlike Nascar, which typically runs two-lap shootouts to the finish when a caution interrupts the ending, IndyCar rarely follows the same procedure. Sato was instead able to coast around the speedway, with Dixon’s plan to run down his rival as he worked through lapped traffic spoiled by the crash with four laps to go.Sato, who also won here in 2017, said he knew Dixon would have been tough to beat under green. “I know Scott was coming right through, out of turn four, he was screaming”, Sato said. “I had to hold him off.”Sato’s Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing teammate, Graham Rahal, came in third. Team owners David Letterman and Graham’s father, Bobby Rahal, were at the track to congratulate both riders. The new track owner, Roger Penske, was hosting his first Indy 500 without spectators present, although a new lift that carried Sato up to an elevated victory circle did liven up the formalities. The speedway typically draws more than 300,000 spectators for one of the biggest live sport events in the US Penske said there would be only 2,500 people in attendance Sunday due to the coronavirus outbreak. Santino Ferrucui came fourth, with Josef Newgarden the highest-placed Chevrolet in fifth.Pigot, the third Rahal driver in the race, was taken to local hospital for further examination after his crash. IndyCar has said he is awake and alert."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38390f43a6c4f1afbf625d85c626bbef006467a2/0_249_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=386d3b1be85caeb0abe7b1e07d2de151","title":"tour de france 2020 cycling stage guide","story":"The 107th edition of the classic features a Grand Départ on the Riviera and eight mountain days on the 21-stage routeTwo loops north of Nice over a serious-looking climb, the Côte de Rimiez, with a finish on the Promenade des Anglais with 38km between the last bit of uphill and the finish, there is time for the peloton to regroup if it splits on the climb. Will favour sprinters who can climb a bit such as the Italian Elia Viviani.The toughest opening weekend stage in 40 years. First category Cols de la Colmiane and Turini will show immediately if any favourites are off form, and should cause a selection of maybe 50 riders a final little climb 9km from the end is tailor-made for home hopefuls Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot.Immensely scenic run north partly using the Route Napoléon through towns like Grasse and Digne les Bains. Peppered with small climbs early on, but a mainly downhill final 80km means unless it’s full-on all the way this should be one for the pure sprinters such as the Aussie Caleb Ewan or Ireland’s Sam Bennett.An unusually tough summit finish for this early in the Tour at a ski resort famed for a 1971 duel between Eddy Merckx and Luis Ocaña, at the end of a long drag to 1,825m above sea level. There will be a sort-out among the favourites, but nothing conclusive. Another good finish for Alaphilippe, or a strong finisher such as Rigoberto Urán.Largely downhill, this is another one earmarked for the sprinters, but the finish merits a closer look, climbing gradually in the final eight kilometres. Might favour a “punchy” finisher such as the Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet or Milan-San Remo winner Wout van Aert.The second tough summit finish in three days: a 12km ascent to the Col de la Lusette, a brief downhill and an 8km drag to the finish. With 150km before the climbs, a break will get here well before the main men sort each other out. One for climbers with no aspirations overall, such as the Frenchmen Pierre Rolland or Kenny Elissonde.Brutally lumpy and baking-hot roads in the Massif Central and a meaty 14.5km climb in the middle. The finale will see a classic battle between a break and the sprinters’ teams, with odds on the break. A day for a strong all-terrain rider such as the Belgian Tiesj Benoot or France’s Lilian Calmejane.A classic Pyrenean stage: two first-category mountains and the super-category Port de Balès. There should be a pattern to the racing now and a strong team such as Jumbo or Ineos should control the pace. It’s a tricky downhill to the finish so while the overall contenders test each other, the stage will suit a climber with descending skills such as the Slovenian Matej Mohoric.A break should succeed today: there will be an intense battle until it forms and it will get whittled down on the Col de Marie-Blanque 19 km from the finish. One for a climber who can finish well, and isn’t high up overall: if Ireland’s Daniel Martin or Uran are not in the top 20 they will target this one.A transfer up the Atlantic coast for the flattest stage of the race. Bound to be a sprint finish so one for the likes of Bennett or Ewan or Viviani, but the question is whether the wind blows strongly off the sea in which case the race is likely to split and the outcome is anyone’s guess.The only truly innocuous stage in the first 10 days, and there should be a westerly so this will be rapid. By now it will be obvious which sprinters are in the mix so there will be pressure on the second-stringers such as Nacer Bouhanni of France and Giacomo Nizzolo of Italy if they haven’t landed one yet.A rare stage longer than 200km. Lumpy roads into the fiefdom of ex-president Chirac and tired legs will make this another day for a break while the select group of favourites wait for the Alps. Wise money will go on a clever one-day specialist such as the young world champion Mads Pedersen or a strongman like Thomas De Gendt.Arguably the hardest stage, with seven climbs ending with the highest pass of the Massif Central. It’s a day that should decide the polka-dot best-climber’s jersey, while the finish will show who is looking good for the Alps. Will favour a pure climber such as Mikel Landa or Nairo Quintana, but anyone wanting to win has to show well here.A second category climb after 68.5km will see off many of the sprinters, while a couple of short late hills will favour an attack from the likes of France’s Benoît Cosnefroy, or De Gendt. The overall contenders will want to stay out of trouble as the Alps loom.A super-category uphill finish on a super-steep climb in the southern Jura this is where GC riders such as Egan Bernal or Primoz Roglic will have to show what they have left. The concentrated climbing in the final 80km will make it difficult for a break to succeed so an overall contender such as Bernal might win here.Never flat, and with an 11km climb into the Vercors Massif, this stage favours an early break, and the winner will probably escape on the ascent 20km from the finish. It’s the sort of stage that suits a climber who isn’t afraid to go solo, such as the Dutchman Bauke Mollema if he isn’t in the overall mix.The last of eight Alpine stages: a saw-tooth profile, with the partly gravel Plateau de Glières 32km from the finish. None of the favourites can afford a bad day here, but it doesn’t have the scary look of the day before. A stage for a break, a last chance for a rider like Romain Bardet or Warren Barguil to shine if he has had a poor three weeks.The last day when a team that haven’t won a stage can break their duck in recent years a handful of teams have dominated in the Tour, so the pressure could be on half the field. Even so, it’s likely to be a bunch sprint for whoever has survived the Alps.Stage 20, 19 September, Lure – La Planche des Belles Filles, 36km time trialTime was the Tour had up to 120km of time trials but that has been whittled down to create more exciting racing for television. A steep uphill finish like this one should confirm what we’ve seen on the climbs in the past few days France will be praying for a good Tour from Pinot, whose home village of Melisey features early on today.The final stage of the Tour, so expect the usual bunch sprint – last year won by Ewen – but with two provisos. The first is how the race has weathered the Covid-19 storm – will riders and teams have dropped out along the way? – and the second, how the riders have coped with relatively little competition time in this condensed, rejigged season of racing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a67ba0f56efec71c77bf069a03341038101389/0_0_3493_2097/master/3493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=268658bd2752a9b6b8b0dac60b1da84e","title":"england v pakistan third test day four live","story":"So yes, we’re not close to cricket. But once we get back on, we might be back on for the day. “I really don’t think we’ll yachna,” says Adrian Goldman, |as we can’t all be old Jewish women (or are you implying something about the readers of your OBO?), but we’ll certainly kvetch about your use of Yiddish.”As I understand it, yachne is a noun – the women to whom you refer – but in my experience, it is also a verb, meaning to talk lots, generally about issues which do not directly pertain to Torah and godliness. “Some time today, presumably Jimmy will bowl the ball that gives him his 600th test wicket,” says Chris East. “But as your colleague Jonathan Liew points out, he will also have bowled 33,000+ balls with no result. Dunno what this proves except that life ain’t always a bowl of cherries! (His teammates dropping everything isn’t helping!)“Yes, that’s sport and also that’s life. Footballers take lots of shots that aren’t goals, tennis players hit lots of groundstrokes that aren’t winners, fighters flick a lot of jabs that aren’t knockout punches, writers delete a lot of words that are too hamfistedly offensive to publish. I think it’s stopped raining and the clean-up is underway, but there’s no indication of an inspection, never mind a restart time. “Can I offer What I Love About Cricket by Sandy Balfour?” asks Mike Barron. “Not about a game or tour, but a beautifully written observation of the effect cricket has on us who love it – and the lengths we go to, to convince others…”Similarly, I’ll hard recommend the great Rob Smyth’s Gentlemen and Sledgers. Should anyone fancy, I went on Jarrod Kimber’s podcast to chat about love, lost love, and the 2005 Ashes. Please do not take offence at my lockdown barnet. It’s brightened up in Southampton, but there’s an absolute load of surface water on covers and pitch. I don’t think we’re getting any play for at least an hour or so. “A story I have always thought worthy of film is that of Frank Worrell’s appointment to the West Indies captaincy,” says Tom Booth. “Political machinations, various heroes, villains and fall-guys, a subject-matter that remains relevant, and a bittersweet ending. The (very good) cricket itself is just a backdrop. Feels like a good subject for the BLM era too. It might even play in America.”Yup, no sign of movement. In the meantime, email. “Biffy Clyro?” asks, er, Matthew Kilsby. “If my namesake continues to sully my good name with preposterous praise for Biffy Clyro then he will be recieving a cease and desist letter from my people. In the words of Muhammad Ali: ‘Now Kilsby, I’ve had enough, stop it’.”Nipping out to buy some grout, I heard Aggers utters the dreaded “filled in” when describing the weather. I fear we may not recommence in seven minutes’ time. It’s teeming down, so I’d not be confident of a 1.10 restart, but I’ll be back just before then and we’ll yachne until such time as play begins, at which point we’ll yachne some more. “I have always thought that cricket during the Victorian era would make for an excellent Downton Abbey-esque serial,” says Richard O’Hagan. “The only problem is that some idiot would insist upon casting Brian Blessed as an elderly WG.”These days you could just go into the street and grab any old bloke. “The greatest unwritten novel ever?” says Paul Griffin. “Look no further than my masterpiece: ‘I might have another biscuit in a short while, unless death strikes.’ Unpickupable. Re Jimmy, this is a wonderful piece on his action, his personality, and Burnley. Who knows, he may become ennobled if he continues to take wickets at this rate and bombastically supports idiotic retrograde nationalist policies with bovine stupidity.”It might also help if a floundering Prime Minister considers him an avatar of their misunderstood but infallibly British values and very own self. “I expect you regret asking for bands now – your inbox will be a flood of Spotify and Youtube links,” says Matthew Kilsby. “BUT: Biffy Clyro are consistently amazing, here’s one of their new ones. For fans of outrageously Scottish accents, fun time signatures, heavy riffs, good melodies, great harmonies, long sweaty hair etc etc.”I sort of look at them as the Scottish Phish – there can’t be many bands out there who inspire the kind of loyalty they have. “I’m pretty certain I have at least three of the greatest unwritten novels in my head,” says Matt Dony. “Filed under ‘More things I didn’t achieve during lockdown.’ On top of the piano, next to the running shoes. Maybe next time we have a catastrophic pandemic, eh?”It’s a date. Anyone wanna buy some yeast? “Hard to get film funding without Americans?” tweets Tom Crawford. “Do what the Americans do, play with the dates and the facts and shoehorn the brilliant Bart King into the picture! (get Matthew McConaughey to play him).”Done and done. It’s been a very decent morning for Pakistan, and I wonder if this is also lunch. In the meantime, we’ll do some emails. 18th over: Pakistan 41-0 (Shan 13, Abid 21) I daresay it won’t be long yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah) before we see Dombess, whose nickname is, I trust, Arena. One off Woakes’ over, Abid nudging into the on side, and the umpires are about to look at the light. 17th over: Pakistan 40-0 (Shan 13, Abid 21) After two singles from four balls, Archer goes around to the left-handed Shan. The ball’s doing very little, and it seems clear now that England will have to ruckus extremely hard for these 10 wickets. Six sessions is still a long time to bat, but if the weather taxes a couple, a draw looks very doable. “My son (now 23) used to play youth cricket for his village,” says Edward Collier, bowling tricky and successful leg breaks. However, he had a very weird action, which meant he wasn’t looking at the batsman at the point of delivery. I took him to a bigger local club to see if he could get some coaching and with a view to joining them, but the head coach said that unless he changed his action they weren’t interested. Sadly, he lost interest after that and no longer plays (though I take him to Lord’s to watch, or at least I used to ...)”This reminds me of a yarn I once watched Noel Gallagher recount, about a guitar teacher who wouldn’t let him play left-handed because he’s right-handed. “So, if you’re watching,” he said, “d’ya wanna borrow a tenner?”16th over: Pakistan 38-0 (Shan 12, Abid 20) Woakes raps Abid on the pad, who misses with his flick there’s an appeal, but that was going down. Next ball, Abid gets it right, turning two to midwicket, and suddenly it’s looking extremely gloomy out there. “As you ask,” emails Simon Beaufoy, “on a day where fast bowlers are being celebrated, Lee Hall (Billy Elliot etc) and I have written a film script about Harold Larwood. Of course Bodyline, but more extraordinarily, what happened AFTER Bodyline. His principled and absolute refusal to take the rap, his excommunication from the England team, his years in the wilderness running a sweet shop in Blackpool for goodness sake (can you see Jimmy measuring out Pear Drops on retirement?) and his ultimate rescue by - inevitably and beautifully - the very Australians he’d been knocking out cold with his bowling, who were so appalled by his treatment that they organised his passage to Australia, a house and a job.Hard to raise finance on cricket films as the Americans …. just don’t do cricket. It’s a cracking story, though, and like so much sport it’s as much about class conflict as cricket. The film may never see the light of day, but it’s all beautifully told in Duncan Hamilton’s book, which I’m sure you know.”That sounds great, but yes, it’s hard to get funding from the US when pitching something not US-focused. Hang in there though, you only need one person to say yes. 15th over: Pakistan 36-0 (Shan 12, Abid 18) Shan tucks Archer away to square leg for two, the only runs from the over. “We definitely need a fictionalised account of Viv Richards at home,” says Pete Salmon, whose biography of Jacques Derrida is out in October I’ve got a semiotic etc etc. “Do you think he still has the same swagger when doing his laundry or doing the recycling? Of course to be a proper show there would need to be a journey. Viv at 12, skinny and frightened, being hit again and again in the nets, before a wise old Antiguan hands him a stick of gum and says, ‘Bite down on this son, it helps ... at least, it helped me.’ Cut to him watching Viv flay England in 76. See? I told you! See? The rest writes itself.”I actually wrote about Viv’s swagger – and MS Dhoni’s – in Joy of Six: cool sports stars. I am certain it is omnipresent. 14th over: Pakistan 34-0 (Shan 10, Abid 18) Woakes has been much better this morning, flowing through another maiden. If England can staunch the scoring, they’ll feel like a wicket is on the cards. Drinks. “Further to Ben Dorning’s email,” says James Taylor, “may I suggest the excellent Netherland, by Joseph O’Neill, about the life of a Dutchman living in New York in the wake of the September 11 attacks who takes up cricket and starts playing at the Staten Island Cricket Club, which is populated by immigrants from the Caribbean and Southern Asia? A truly excellent read, and a lovely introduction to the reasons why cricket is such a wonderful game.”13th over: Pakistan 34-0 (Shan 10, Abid 18) Two dots from Archer, then he moves one into Shan and clumps him on the thigh there’s an appeal, the loudest of the morning so far, but also a definite edge. Maiden. “There’s a marvellous anecdote about that Geoff Arnold over in the Tony Greig autobiography,” tweets David Pearce. “He dropped one of those catches and Jon Snow the other two. Captain Ray Illingworth went ballistic in the tea interval. He then missed a sitter himself in the gully and went on TV afterwards, saying that it was one of the worst grounds for seeing the ball that he’d ever played on!”Of course it was. Did he also happen to drop in that he was from Yorkshire? 12th over: Pakistan 34-0 (Shan 10, Abid 18) England are bowling a little fuller now, and looking more like taking wickets. two singles from the over. “I think that if you want more people to watch cricket and be engaged in it then you have to forego some money and instead put it on free-to-air TV. Let it run in the background of everyday life. One of Australia’s better tag lines is about cricket being the sound of the summer.”Yes, I agree - ideally cricket would be free. But we do also need to recognise what’s been done with it on a dedicated sportcricket channel. I’m not sure what the answer is, nor what’s possible, but Ali Martin has written in these pages about making the Lord’s Test available to all, and that seems fair to me. 11th over: Pakistan 32-0 (Shan 9, Abid 17) Archer replaces Anderson, while in commentary, Strauss says he’s enjoyed watching Archer in this Test but that he shouldn’t think he needs to go short all the time. I agree - the short stuff, though it’s an occasional tactic, generally works best as a surprise. It’s amazing how often we stray from the truism that if you bowl full and straight, you get wickets. Maiden. “The same comment about coaching was made by Zak Crawley yesterday,” says Richard O’Hagan. “Apparently he became much more successful when he stopped listening to coaches who were trying to introduce a trigger movement to his game.Anyway, after bowling five overs of pure filth yesterday, my view is that looking at the batsman is overrated as it simply gives you advance warning of where you are being tonked to next.”The lost art of sitting down and shutting up. 10th over: Pakistan 32-0 (Shan 9, Abid 17) Woakes replaces Broad he was not good yesterday, so will want to resolve that. I should add that in Broad’s final over, he requested the obligatory ball-check, which revealed ... nothing amiss. Anyhow, Abid gets on his tippy-toes to drive two towards point, then Woakes clatters him on the pad – there’s a strangulated appeal but even Root refuses the review – before a full swinger screeches past the outside edge. That’s much better from Woakes. “My own unpenned memoir, Just Millings About, is the greatest ever unwritten book,’ says Mac Millings. “I’d love to send you a copy to prove it but, well y’know.”9th over: Pakistan 30-0 (Shan 9, Abid 15) Ollie Pope has a sore left shoulder and there are no plans for him to return, but they’ll check him over at lunch. A two and a three from the over, both to Abid, which is to say that Pakistan are going well. “One more required and Jimmy will have a unique kind of fivefer,” says Alex Fleetwood. “Any ideas what the record is for dropped catches off a single bowler in an innings?”I just came by this, which doesn’t give us the answer but does give some context:“The data turns up four batsmen who have been dropped five times in an innings: one was Andy Blignaut, whose 84 not out at Harare 2005 included an extremely rare hat-trick of dropped catches, Zaheer Khan the unhappy bowler. (There was also a hat-trick of missed chances at Old Trafford in 1972, Geoff Arnold bowling to two batsmen.) The others missed five times are Hashim Amla (253 at Nagpur 2010), Taufeeq Umar (135 at St Kitts 2011) and Kane Williamson (242* at Wellington 2014). Nothing in this century quite matches the seven or eight missed catches (reports vary) off George Bonnor in making 87 in 1883, or six misses off Bill Ponsford in his 266 at The Oval in 1934. Wavell Hinds was dropped twice at the MCG in 2000, and still made a duck.”8th over: Pakistan 25-0 (Shan 9, Abid 10) Four dots, then Broad squares Shan, who squirts him for four down to third man. But Shan does not appreciate his fortune, waving at the next delivery and doing well to see it pass the bat unmolested. “With reference to your notion of a suitable period for a cricket film,” says Ben Dorning, “a few years ago I thought that the MCC tour of West Indies in 1934-35 was a potentially good story. So much so (and with it being unobscured by annoying things like recorded historical fact) that somewhere on my hard drive lurks a file entitled ‘cricnovel’ in which I attempted to fictionalise it into a novel. Dramatis Personae included Learie Constantine, George Headley, idiosyncratic captains Bob Wyatt and Jackie Grant, Les Ames and Wally Hammond and a mysterious venal illness he contracts, mostly told from the perspective of an invented reporter. I thought the resultant draft was quite noticeably bad! So I abandoned it. However, the film The Edge does suggest that you can tell a story about cricket without including a lot of match details that would boremystify the casual reader. Wonder if any other OBOers have ever tried to write fiction about cricket?”I agree entirely. I’m actually rereading Beyond a Boundary at the moment, and the characters are so beautifully drawn. I also agree on the Edge – I’ve been lucky enough to make a couple of sports docs, and you’re trying to include as little actual sport as possible. More generally, there is not the slightest doubt that your first draft will be ungood because that is the nature of first drafts – making them good is what’s done afterwards, so don’t be despondent. 7th over: Pakistan 21-0 (Shan 5, Abid 10) After a few overs to get warm Anderson is into stride now, beating Abid with one that straightens, then enticing a drive but eluding the edge. Maiden. On another matter but not on another matter given what we do here, this piece from OBO alumnus Russell Jackson, is an essential piece of reading. 6th over: Pakistan 21-0 (Shan 5, Abid 10) Four dots from Broad, then Abid turns three off the pads - the only runs of the over. “An early setback Jimmy had to overcome (at a suitably early dramatic time in his career) was the attempt by various coaches to re-model his action,” says John Starbuck, “because he couldn’t actually see the batsman at the point of delivery. He made those people look very silly indeed.”Yes he did. I’m actually in the middle of writing something about this in a footballing context, but sometimes the best coaching - or teaching, or parenting – is knowing to shut up and do nothing. 5th over: Pakistan 18-0 (Shan 5, Abid 7) Nasser notes that if Jimmy gets to 600 in 13.2 overs, he’ll have done so quicker than anyone else in terms of deliveries bowled. But ... IT’S ANOTHER DROP! That’s four in 37 deliveries! He slants one across Shan, who follows the ball because it magnetises his bat, and Buttler doesn’t only miss the catch but gets nowhere near it! It was a really hefty edge and it wobbled on him, but still – as these things go, that was a dolly. Jimmy absolutely loves it, as you would, protruding his tongue in rueful manner. 4th over: Pakistan 16-0 (Shan 3, Abid 7) Pakistan are looking to be positive, and Abid square-drives through point for two. He edges Broad’s next delivery, which dies in front of Burns at two, then compounds the bowler’s unfettered joy by twizzling him off the pads for four to midwicket. “I can’t answer your question,” says Elliot Carr-Barnsley, “but I just wanted to share with you an absolute belter of an underrated Supergrass single, perfect for wistful reflection on how life has changed for the worse. So, an anthem for 2020.3rd over: Pakistan 10-0 (Shan 3, Abid 6) Two singles, then Anderson persuades one to leave Abid, who’s beaten. Abid then flicks off the pads, they skank a quick single, and Bracey, on for Pope, shies with him well home, conceding four overthrows. Naturally, Jimmy slaps his thigh and soils his jockstrap at the sheer slapstick mirth of it all. “The ‘thing’ that puts people off cricket,” writes Ian Copestake, “is that it is not understood and not deemed comprehensible in the time given us to live our lives on earth. Like a novel that Joseph Heller decided not to write, ‘Nothing Happens.’”Is that the greatest unwritten novel ever? Have we invented a new genre of listicle? 1st over: Pakistan 1-0 (Shan 0, Abid 0) A gentle looser after a hectic yesterday strays down leg, and they run a leg bye. Meanwhile, in commentary, Warne says that Glenn McGrath remembers every single one of his 563 Test wickets, which is a remarkable thing Athers gets in there first, and chuckles that he’ll be featuring heavily. Maiden.“Nothing can be more ‘cricket’ than spending a week, with the governing bodies and media, talking about the need to use more common sense to make up for lost time and delays.So far in this test, we have seen players go off just before lunch. Restart play when lunch should be taking place, and then go off for lunch when the weather is much better.Decline the opportunity to start at 10:30 because the weather MIGHT not have been as good, only for the weather to take a turn for the worse 5 minutes after play started, thus missing out on an extra half hour play. Oh, and then we lost another half hour at the end of the day because it got too dark.And then we learnt our lessons from the previous day, by making assumptions on a weather forecast, meaning again, we have lost out on another half hour of play, plus whatever we are going to inevitably lose at about 10 past 11.Stuff like this is what puts so many people off cricket. We’ve had an incredible summer of cricket, under the most ridiculous circumstances, with two great series, brilliant matches, captivating sessions, stunning achievements, and sub stories, and of course the ridiculous (I’m talking about you and your run out Stuart Broad). But instead, the archaic rules are holding the sport back.”But is this the kind of thing that puts people off, or is it the kind of thing that irritates the likes of us? I’m not doubting that we can and must do better, but ultimately I think that people are put off Test cricket by the very nature of Test cricket, and because they’re not lucky enough to have someone help them love it. Jimmy has the ball....Here come the players. Azhar is not opening. “Instead of ball tracking on every appeal,” returns Brendan Large, “which would not exactly help attract new viewers to a game that is already slow paced ... could we not just agree that Michael Gough should umpire all tests?”The problem is that we also need Michael Gough as third umpire. Otherwise, I’m not sure whether we need to do anything about the pace of the game because I’m not sure whether Test cricket needs to change. People love it for what it is, and we need to encourage people to appreciate that, not alter what that is. I guess one might wonder if we know enough about the below from the various docs, but what you get with a scripted piece is access to people’s internal and private world. There’s no footage, say, of Viv Richard at home or hanging out with his mates a fictionalised account gives the writer scope to do something with that. Essentially, it’s possible to show things that may not be fact but that are true. “I’ve enjoyed your OBO coverage this summer,” says Tom van der Gucht, “and was engaged by your preamble regarding the linking of sport and life this morning reminding me of your article about the intertwined period of the Ashes and your own turbulent life experiences in 2005 - something that ought to be dramatised on the BBC in a similar fashion to My Summer With Des starring Neil Morrisery and Rachel Weiz, if you saw it. Not that I’m saying you should be played by Tony from Men Behaving Badly...I had a quick look on your bio and saw you are working on a film about Eubank and Benn and it got me wondering what cricketing period would be ripe for a film adaptation. I remember reading that David Peace was working on a book about Boycott’s fall-out with the Yorkshire committee in a similar vein to his Damned United fictionalised account of LUFC, but I don’t think that has materialised yet.Ah, so much. Bodyline, the D’Oliveira“From the preamble on James Anderson,” says James Byrne, “600 wickets and 29 fifers: ‘We will never experience anything like it again.’ Well, at least not until Stuart Broad does it in a couple of years...”Broad will do well to match the fifers – he’s on 18 at the moment – but might get to 600, though the competition for places makes it tricker that previously. But it’ll still be different, because Broad is a different thing. We’ll never see anything like him again either, even if he calls it a career this morning. “I wasn’t sure about your answer, so I looked it up,” clarifies Bob O’Hara. According to the laws, you’re right that a batsman can retire, but can only return if they’re Retired Injured, or if the opposition captain allows them to. BUT I assume play hadn’t been called, so presumably the Pakistani innings hadn’t started. Thus I assume Azhar Ali doesn’t have to bat.”Talking of which, and seeing as we’re talking about the passing of time, is there a guitar band around now, anywhere near as good as Supergrass, who were not the best of their time? I suppose I’m just old. “I did have to laugh when I read the reason for not starting at 10.30 was due to the forecast being better later in the day,” says Brendan Large. “Surely when there has been time lost to bad weather they should be trying to make up the overs, which was why this new option was permitted for this test?!? Also ‘later in the day’ is also when the bloody light gets ‘bad’ as a rule is it not?”I’ve not a clue, I’m afraid. But when it’s late in the day, I’m thinking of you, things that you say, so long, so long for me. “Two points,” says Ian Wilkison. “1. Given that a) the basic impossibility of the umpire always giving a correct LBW decision has been acknowledged by the arrival of technology and b) the fact that just about every umpiring decision is challenged anyway, would it not be more sensible to bypass this preliminary stage and simply go to the ball tracker ?2. Can you tell me what is causing that incredibly irritating noise every few seconds? Imagine a small child preparing to play Three Blind Mice on a recorder – nightmare.”Have you not heard of Michael Gough? But the point, to me at least, is that the human eye is not infallible and neither is the technology. The human element is also part of the fabric of the game, so worth protecting, and as things go, we’re getting most decisions correct. As for the noise, I think it’s probably the jingle-jangle of a thousand lost souls*. *award yourself 10 points if you know. When England won the toss, I had a few quid on them to win this Test - flat track, confidence up, opponents who might fancy going home. I just had a look, and all I can cash out is my stake, which tells you the weather forecast for the next two days is infelicitous to say the least. It’s dry at the moment, though, which causes a person to wonder why we’re not starting at 10.30am. Email! “This has what has been keeping me awake all night,” opens Robert Heath. “As I understand it, Azhar Ali, feeling that the force was with him, decided to open once the follow-on was enforced and walked out to bat again ……….. but the light was deemed too bad and no ball was bowled in the second innings. So, this morning, does he HAVE to open, or can they revert to their normal openers if they choose?”He doesn’t have to because he any batsman can retire if it suits, but I’d be surprised if he didn’t. On 22nd May 2003, James Anderson made his Test debut for England against Zimbabwe at Lord’s. Naturally, he took fifer in his first innings, cleaning up the tail with 4-7 off 14 deliveries.Since then, I have been to law school, finished law school, trained as a lawyer, got orced, qualified as a lawyer, become a writer, got married, written some books, become a father, and made some films. I say all of that, not because it is inherently interesting – it is not – but because I’m struggling. Struggling to get a handle on Anderson’s achievements in a purely cricketing context, and the details of my life could be the details of anyone’s life, used to grasp and express the passing of time. Sport is so entwined in our lives as to be inisible from it, a dialectic, a heritage and an identity. So I’ve filled in my gaps, you’ll fill in yours, and perhaps together we can appreciate what we’ve seen, what we’re seeing and what we’ll see. Because James Anderson is still taking fifers for England. He now has 29 in total – the most recent of them yesterday – and 598 wickets in all. If the weather holds, the likelihood is that he’ll reach 600 sometime today, which isn’t just a bit of base-10 fun, but an opportunity for us to salute and reflect on an achievement so wild there is no comparator through which we can filter it to understand it better, forcing us to make it about ourselves even more promptly than usual. We will never experience anything like it again just as we will never see experience anything like our old lives again, but to experience them once is privilege enough. Play 11am BST (because the weather is expected to be better later in the day)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9869d06b77bb8c5c87e5e9a75c4fb2ad1cc19f32/21_0_5368_3223/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3481514b26043ac8482a25222b257867","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year. Meanwhile, buon appetito.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

If you’re one of the thousands who have saddled up for the first time during or post-lockdown, fear not – this isn’t your average commuting kit.I’m on my way to catch a train to Lyme Regis, the starting point of a coast-to-coast bikepacking trip (basically, cycling and carrying your camping kit) via four of England’s oldest trails. Known collectively as the Greater Ridgeway, the 362-mile mixed-terrain route has neolithic roots and is a favourite with hikers. Departing from Dorset’s dramatic Jurassic Coast, it meanders along the Wessex Ridgeway, the Ridgeway, the Icknield Way and Peddars Way to Holme-next-the-Sea in Norfolk. OS Maps suggest there’s a corresponding cycle route, with bike-friendly ersions along the way, making it a (seemingly) ideal route for a bikepacking expedition.Although not a new phenomenon, bikepacking is a growing trend. Panniers and racks are out the preferred option is now specialist luggage attached to the bike by Velcro and straps in a streamlined set up. “We’ve seen an increase in sales and new customers,” says George Huxford of bag maker Apidura, confirming that, as with the rest of the cycling industry, Covid has had a positive impact on business.While a hedge and a waterproof bivvy bag are the preferred choice of sleeping quarters for hardcore enthusiasts, most bikepackers opt for a bothy or official campsite. This makes bikepacking bang on trend, combining camping with a more enjoyable method of arriving at your pitch than sitting in a car or taking public transport. Cycling UK is a valuable resource, starting with advice on how to plan a simple weekend ride and camp miles from your doorstep.What I’m attempting is certainly on the more extreme side (minus the hedges). An experienced cyclist with a number of 100-mile sportives under my belt, I’m looking to cover the Greater Ridgeway in four days – those looking for a more leisurely ride could choose a shorter section over more time. Four hours in, though, I’m questioning the plans I’d made from the comfort of my front room.Boulder-packed descents, loose gravel climbs and impassable sections of path that look like they haven’t been walked on, let alone ridden, since the stone age mean it’s slow going over Dorset’s undulating countryside. When I find myself 42 miles short of my campsite in Sixpenny Handley with only three hours of daylight left, I need to find a more direct route. Unlike the druids before me, I have the benefit of switching to smooth asphalt roads.I arrive at Church Farm Caravan and Camping Park (pitches from £11.50) as the sun is setting, the tougher travails of the day softened by my catching a glimpse of the Cerne Giant while descending into the village of Cerne Abbas. Hastily assembling my tarp – a sheet that provides the shelter of a tent for a fraction of the weight – in the light of a friendly neighbour’s car headlights, I conclude that I need a plan B. My routes will have to change, allowing me to reach my remaining campsites in daylight, see some more sights and average 90 miles a day. I will cut out some of the winding, time-consuming tracks and trails in favour of the streets of Newbury, Cambridge and Thetford.New routes plotted, I find the riding improves immediately. I have time for a leisurely pit stop at The Bridge Inn, Upper Woodford, north of Salisbury, for coffee and a thick slice of carrot cake, and continue across the Salisbury Plain military training ground (there are various routes, but the clearly marked danger zones should, obviously, be avoided). The views across the hills are breathtaking and I even spy muntjac, hares and pheasants.This was the bikepacking experience I’d hoped for: Wilton Windmill appearing on the hillside from a quiet country lane waving to barges on the canalside paths of the Kennet and tackling the Ridgeway’s woodland trails with hearty helpings of calories every few hours. Reaching White Mark Farm campsite in Watlington (pitches from £8) ahead of schedule, I down a well-earned pint and devour a pizza in the Spire \u0026amp Spoke’s sunny beer garden before I tend to my tarp, queue for my socially distanced shower and bed down for the night as red kites circle above.A 5.30am wakeup call courtesy of that distinctive screech doesn’t dampen my spirits, and I’m soon back in the saddle – a 110-mile epic standing between me and the Kings Forest Caravan Park (adults only, pitches from £15) on the NorfolkSuffolk border. It starts with a rollercoaster ride past Chequers, and by lunchtime I’m grateful to have swapped the punchy peaks of the Chilterns for the pan-flat Fens. The addition of luggage makes the climbs rather harder (an off-piste ascent on Aldbury Common sticks in the mind), but the trick is to embrace bikepacking’s slower nature. The environment then takes on a new vividness, making for a much more rewarding experience.I rise with the sun, the scent of the pine forests lingering while I pack up for the last time. There’s just 50 miles to go and the waves of Norfolk’s coast are pulling me towards the end – even a ford, ripe for a spot of wild swimming in Castle Acre, can’t break their magnetic spell. I grin when I spy the Wash and don’t stop smiling until I reach the sandy beach of Holme-next-the-Sea.After a train ride from King’s Lynn, I’m back grinding through traffic on London’s streets. While my expedition may have got off to a choppy start, I’ve been bitten by the bikepacking bug. I’m plotting my next escape from the city before I even reach my front door.• Charlie Allenby is the author of Bike London (Spring 2021, ACC Art Books).

Bespectacled, gawky, socially awkward and only 23 years old, I had been a surprising choice as a correspondent on Michael Moore’s TV Nation, a US network show where I stumbled around the wilds of America meeting extremists of various stripes: klansmen, cult members, sexual adventurers.Later, based on these segments, I landed my own TV series, Louis Theroux’s Weird Weekends. For some reason the BBC had insisted on putting my name in the title. Watching some of my early efforts again recently, with the distance of two decades, I couldn’t help passing judgment on the journalistic competence on display – whether I was asking the right questions of the porn performers and the apocalypse preppers. Sometimes I caught myself enjoying the raw, unvarnished reality and marvelling at how much we had managed to capture on tape. From time to time I saw the younger me as overly pushy and badgering, or in danger of being borderline rude. But I could see that was mostly from my awkwardness at being hired for a job I didn’t fully understand, and my worries about letting people down. Mainly I was distracted by my appearance, voice and how I came across. The way my hair is piled on top of my head. The faint mid-Atlantic twang in my accent.I was definitely a little bit of a tool, but what was harder to know was whether that was an obstacle or part of my gift.I was watching my old shows back recently not for simple nostalgia – though that would have been a good enough reason given how much has changed – but because I was faced with the more practical question of how to continue doing my job under lockdown. When the world shut down in March, a series of programmes I was working on was suddenly no longer feasible due to travel restrictions. I had a team ready to work but no projects. I made a podcast, Grounded With Louis Theroux. But I am a TV maker. What documentaries were possible that didn’t involve me leaving the house?Quite quickly, the idea of a retrospective show came up. The TV equivalent of a greatest hits album. Take the best bits from old programmes and link them together somehow using voiceover or maybe an interview with a director. The grammar could be figured out at a later stage. It was something we had thought about doing for a while – 2019 marked 25 years since I had started my career in television – but we never got round to it. But that was the pre-Covid thinking. In a world re-made by a virus, one of the many things that has changed is the appetite for archive-based television. Would we make four instead of one, the channel asked. Wow. OK. And like that, we went to work on an ambitious career retrospective with the title – dreamed up by me, and only partly because I secretly hoped it evoked subliminal thoughts of David Attenborough – Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge.Boiling down more than 50 hours of TV – not to mention the hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours of raw footage – turned out to be about as hard as you might expect. For a while I imagined it might be some kind of self-deconstruction of our processes. “An Adam Curtis kind of thing,” we airily said. “Show the bits you never see. The producer in shot. Programmes we never made.” This idea quickly evaporated in the heat of having to make a documentary that featured material viewers might actually want to see and that made some kind of sense. Instead we chose four themes that might impose an order on the material: belief, family, crime and the dark side of pleasure.These themes, while they were come by in a spirit of pragmatism, ended up giving us a coherence and cumulative logic that ended up being one of the greatest and most pleasurable discoveries of the whole process. Without realising it or intending it, it turns out the films I’ve been involved in making have captured a portrait of a changing culture, an oblique cultural history seen through the eyes of the people I have documented. This is true in obvious ways: given that I’ve made several films in jails and prison, and several others that involved immersion in police forces in major cities, it shouldn’t be surprising to look back and see the pre-history to the killing of George Floyd and the reaction to it, and the myriad ways in which they were both predicted and prefigured. What was more surprising was the way in which some of my older programmes contextualised and maybe explained the Trump phenomenon. The first episode of the series, about belief, features an Idaho-based second-amendment diehard with a penchant for apocalyptic conspiracy theories an elderly man with weird hair who’s in touch with UFOs a neo-Nazi family and a Vegas-based self-advertised multimillionaire and get-rich-quick guru. Having watched all these unlikely characters for 55 minutes, somehow when Donald Trump pops up at the end of the programme it is with an almost eerie feeling of inevitability.I also wanted to update stories by looking at what happened next – to the worlds they showed and the people involved in them. To an almost morbid extent, I circle around stories after completing them – I find it hard to let go and move on. Sometimes I stay in email contact with old subjects, or my team check in with them. Making Life on the Edge meant I had a reason to share the surprising developments in stories I had been tracking for years and also to reach out to other contributors I had long been curious to catch up with. Megan Phelps-Roper – who left the hate-spewing Westboro Baptist Church, founded by her grandfather Fred Phelps – has become a friend. She has published a book about her experiences and does talks on how to build bridges and communicate with people on the extremes (or simply people who disagree with you) in a way that they will hear. I spoke to her during the lockdown and we included a small portion of the conversation in the new series. I also spoke with JJ, the porn performer from Weird Weekends. He says he doesn’t regret a minute of being in the industry, describing it as an enriching and important part of his life. What you might think would be self-destructive, can sometimes end up being lifesaving.Of the various updates, one of the most moving for me, personally, was one I did about the aforementioned UFO believer with weird hair: the Rev Robert Short. Short was a “space channel”, meaning he could summon the personality of an entity, called Korton from the planet Koldas, and he would prognosticate in booming tones from an outbuilding at his unassuming house on the outskirts of Cornville, Arizona. I first saw him channel back in 1997, for a programme about aliens. It was a moment of comedy in the finished film. The weirdness of the voices and mannerisms and the outlandishness of Short’s claims couldn’t help coming across as funny. He died late last year, but we found some extraordinary footage that shows him, a year or two ago, though enfeebled and poignantly reduced, still channelling his alien friend. It’s almost as though he’s beaming to me from beyond the grave, and so, in a short space in the film we go from finding him amusing and maybe even ridiculous, to seeing him in a way that is wistful and rather moving.I suppose this ability to see a contributor in a new, more three-dimensional way brings up the question of changes in me. When I look at my own motivations and my own journey, I am forced to face the negative alongside the positive: a tendency, when younger, to maybe be glib, to disarm with the aim of making light of people’s deeply held beliefs, to act the clown, to make fun. That was part of how I saw my role, to be the straight man in a weird world, and there were times, looking back, when I see I may have gone too far. I also acknowledge my own sense of attraction to the dark side – the darkness of misguided beliefs and self-destructive behaviours. But – as I comment at the end of the programme dedicated to the dark side of pleasure – the aim of life shouldn’t be to avoid mistakes, to be sober, righteous and godly in everything, to be pious and upstanding and utterly bland. You have to wrap your arms around the whole of life, and – at the risk of sounding like my Las Vegas self-help guru friend – view your missteps as an important part of your journey.And it may be my mistakes – or at least the challenges I endured in order to change – that, looking back, I’m most attached to, because they suggested the possibility of doing things differently. After 25-plus years of doing my job, what strikes me is the development and evolution that has taken place. When I started out in 1994, it would have seemed ludicrous to imagine having the maturity, sensitivity and storytelling chops to make programmes about disability, mental health and addiction. Yet these are the themes that have dominated my most recent programmes – subjects such as eating disorders, dementia and brain injury. They sprang from a process that begun in 2011 when, stuck for subjects to cover, I made a documentary about dementia, even though I knew that for the first time I would be making a documentary in which no one was making a wrong or questionable choice. The success of that episode, and the pleasure of making it, led to other documentaries about families and relationships under stress from forces outside their control. They feature most in the final episode of our new series, about family. They involve people who are in different way vulnerable, struggling and doing the best that can as they battle the vicissitudes of fate. It’s a film that is, more than any of the others, about love. The rewards it brings, the emotional enrichment, how much we suffer in the course of preserving it and nurturing it, and the risk it entails: the possibility that in giving your heart away, it will be hurt.In The Importance of Being Earnest, Oscar Wilde defines fiction as requiring that the good end happily and the bad unhappily. It turns out, surprise surprise, the world isn’t like that. Making my programmes has been among other things, a reminder – were it needed – of how unfair life is, how hard many people have it and how much they have to overcome. Doing the work of documentary-presenting about people and worlds that are in different ways on the edge has left its marks on me, too. But so has 25 years of living, marrying, having children, moving countries, taking out the rubbish, loading and unloading the dishwasher, fighting with those close to me, failing in small duties, succeeding in others and performing the multitude of rituals that make up the bulk of what it is we call life. As I look out, with these eyes, with these thoughts, I don’t notice myself being so very different. I feel like the same person. The texture of my mind and my thought hasn’t changed. It is mainly when I see myself on screen that I see the change. I’m 50 now. The ravages of the ageing process have left their mark. My hair is grey, my eyes don’t work as well as they used to, my knees are going.If I looked like a plonker before, now I look like an old plonker. Maybe that’s progress.Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge is on BBC Two next month"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88df470f628ace22a8fc8b5788608a441a827a2b/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4816ab0fd094da59025deee0f33d7c23","title":"ardern says 2020 has been frankly terrible as auckland lockdown extended","story":"Masks made mandatory on public transport across New Zealand as coronavirus cases continue to riseNew Zealand’s biggest city will remain in lockdown until midnight on Sunday, the extra four days necessitated by the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said.A total of 101 people have been infected by the outbreak in south Auckland, making it the largest cluster in New Zealand.Ardern said the cluster would have been significantly bigger if level three restrictions had not been imposed so quickly, as people had become infected at churches, shopping centres and on public buses.“If it weren’t for level three, this cluster would be exponential, of that I have no doubt,” she said on Monday.“This is a contained cluster. But it is our biggest one. And that means the tail will be long, and the cases will keep coming for a while to come.”Ardern also announced that from Monday masks on public transport would be mandatory country-wide, although some, such as those with severe breathing difficulties, would be exempt.Speaking to New Zealanders who have been demoralised by the second wave of the virus after 102 days of being Covid-free, Ardern acknowledged that 2020 had been exceptionally hard.“If it feels hard – that’s because it has been,” she said. “But let’s also remember, in a world where 2020 has frankly been terrible, we are strong, we have been kind, and we are doing really well.”The source of the outbreak is unidentified, and health authorities say it may never be known.Epidemiological experts welcomed the lockdown extension and said it was the best way to eliminate the virus again.“There are almost certainly still active, unidentified cases in the community with the potential to spark new outbreaks if we relax too soon,” said Prof Michael Plank of Te Pūnaha Matatini.“The cases we have seen as a result of contacts between strangers on bus journeys are an example of how quickly this outbreak could spread. “Provided the recent trend of cases continues, the extra four days at level three will give us a better chance of containing this cluster. We should also remember there is still a risk of the outbreak spreading outside Auckland.”Associate Prof Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist and public health communicator from the University of Auckland, agreed.“This is a pragmatic decision to ensure the current cluster is fully contained,” she said. “The last thing we want is to miss some cases that then turn into further community transmission.”However, resistance to the lockdown is growing in Auckland. Dozens of people joined an anti-lockdown protest in the city at the weekend, saying their rights were being breached.There are also daily reports that Aucklanders are failing to adhere to the lockdown rules as strictly as they did the first time.Dr Dougal Sutherland, a clinical psychologist at Victoria University of Wellington, said the lockdown extension would be “disheartening” for many.“Whereas the first lockdown was accompanied by an increase in anxiety for some, the recent return to level three seemed to bring with it a collective downturn in mood,” he said.“The government announcement today could further erode our collective sense of hope.”Auckland’s mayor, Phil Goff, urged Aucklanders to stay calm and stay the course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2dfdac0d8973ae0f59564b4fb7cbeb59beea9ca/0_136_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3afa95600556ebf8201d6d6c0f2c223c","title":"iran says sabotage caused blast at natanz nuclear site","story":"Officials say security investigations confirmed sabotage, with further details to be released laterIran’s Atomic Energy Organisation said on Sunday that “sabotage” was the cause of an explosion that damaged the Natanz nuclear facility last month.“Security investigations confirm this was sabotage and what is certain is that an explosion took place in Natanz,” spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA. “But how this explosion took place and with what materials ... will be announced by security officials in due course.”Iran said after the incident on 2 July that it had determined its cause but declined to release details due to “security concerns”.Natanz governor Ramezan-Ali Ferdowsi said a fire had broken out at the site, but the country’s atomic agency said it caused no casualties or radioactive pollution.Iranian officials said the fire had caused significant damage that could slow the development of advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges. The Natanz uranium-enrichment site, much of which is underground, is one of several Iranian facilities monitored by inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog. The IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said on Saturday he would make his first trip to Tehran in that role on Monday to pressure Iran to grant inspectors access to two suspected former atomic sites.The IAEA suspects activities possibly related to developing nuclear weapons were carried out in the early 2000s at these sites. Iran insists its nuclear programme has no military dimensions.The Islamic republic resumed uranium enrichment at the Natanz complex, in central Iran, in September last year.At the time of the fire, IRNA published an editorial warning Iran’s arch-foes against hostile actions, saying unnamed Israeli social media accounts had claimed the Jewish state was behind it.The incident came six days after an explosion near a military complex rocked Tehran. That blast in the Parchin area south-east of the Iranian capital was due to “leaking gas tanks”, the defence ministry said.Uranium enrichment resumed after the United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from an international accord that gave Iran relief from sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.Iranian officials said on Sunday that Grossi’s visit was not related to the US push at the UN security council to reimpose international sanctions on Tehran, state TV reported.

With many domestic tourists taking ferries to and from Sardinia, the mainland region of Lazio set up a testing facility at the dock at Civitavecchia, so those driving vehicles off the ferries could line up for immediate testing on their return home.The latest cases have pushed the overall national tally, since the start of the emergency, up to 259,345. The death toll is now 35,437.Italy’s first wave of the pandemic was brutal, with more than 250,000 infections, peaking at about 6,000 cases a day in March. Despite the surge in coronavirus cases, the government has said there are no plans for a new lockdown.Reuters news agency reports the latest remarks from Sweden’s top epidemiologist and architect of its unorthodox pandemic strategy.Sweden is likely to see local outbreaks but no big second wave of Covid-19 cases in the autumn, such as inundated hospitals a few months ago, Anders Tegnell said on Monday.Sweden has been an outlier in Europe’s fight against the novel coronavirus, keeping businesses, restaurants and most schools open throughout the pandemic, while not recommending the use of face masks, which remain a rare sight on city streets.Per capita, Sweden has suffered many times more COVID-19 deaths than its Nordic neighbours, though not quite as many as Europe’s worst-hit countries such as Belgium, Spain and Britain.New cases, hospitalisations and mortality have fallen sharply over the past couple of months. With most Swedes having returned from summer vacations and schools reopening last week for the new semester, there are concerns the country could see a second wave of infections.In an interview with broadcaster TV4, Tegnell said:“We don’t believe we’ll have a classic second wave, such as those seen in influenza pandemics where you get widespread contagion in the community again.This disease appears to work in a different way. The spread is more patchy, so the likelihood is greater that we will see - as one is currently seeing around Europe - outbreaks in certain places, at workplaces and similar environments, during the autumn.With the Swedish death toll nearing 6,000 people, including many nursing home residents who succumbed during March, April and May, Tegnell and the pandemic strategy he champions has ided opinion both at home and abroad.A group of scientists that has long been critical of the country’s response, sometimes engaging in fierce argument with Tegnell, this month warned of a renewed spread of the virus as schools reopened, calling on authorities to step up safeguards.“I think one should always be worried about this disease because it is constantly causing new mischief and is very unpredictable,” Tegnell said. “But that we would return to the situation we had during the spring - we don’t see that.”The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is investigating the circumstances surrounding Irish commissioner Phil Hogan’s attendance at a golf event that may have breached Covid guidelines.Brussels said Hogan, the EU’s trade commissioner, had given an account of his actions to the president, but she had requested further clarification from him.European commission spokesman Dana Spinant told reporters there were “moral aspects” involved in the need to follow coronavirus rules, as well as legal ones:“We feel for the people of Ireland who, like many other people and communities in the European Union over the past months, had to go through difficult times to comply with strict regulations in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” she said.“Many have lost loved ones, many others have been ill and others have suffered from the restrictions. So this is why it is important that rules are respected. This is a matter not just of respecting the rules, but this is also a matter of public health. There are legal aspects involved and there are moral aspects involved as well.”Hogan was asked on Saturday by Ireland’s prime minister and deputy prime minister to consider his position after his attendance at a golf dinner caused public outrage and led to other political resignations.Hogan offered his initial apology on Friday only after the prime minister, Micheál Martin, demanded one.A quick ersion from the WHO press briefing to bring you the latest news from Spain, from our correspondent Stephen Burgen. The Catalan government has called on citizens to rigorously follow existing measures designed to contain the virus after the region registered 1,766 new cases over the past 24 hours, the fifth consecutive day of more than 1,000 new infections. No deaths were reported in the same 24-hour period. “Come what may, we have to go back to work and we have to go back to school,” the regional president, Quim Torra, told a news conference. He said the next three weeks before school starts are vital and called for everyone to limit social activity. Meetings of more than 10 people, private and public, are prohibited.  The Madrid government has asked people to avoid what it calls unnecessary gatherings such as family reunions but at the same time insists they should go to work. The outbreaks have led Apple to close its stores in the capital. In a bid to limit new infections, all bars, restaurants and parks have been closed in the Madrid municipality of Tielmes, while a 14-day lockdown has been imposed on the towns of Cantalejo and Carrascal in Castilla y León.  Despite the many restrictions and widespread compliance, including wearing masks indoors and outdoors, the situation in Spain continues to deteriorate. One explanation put forward by Jonay Ojeda, a specialist in preventive medicine in Madrid, is that after the lockdown ended, responsibility for managing the pandemic passed to the 17 autonomous governments, making a coordinated response all but impossible. Ojeda says the national health ministry took its eye off the ball and accuses it of a lack of leadership.Donald Trump on Sunday announced the emergency authorisation of convalescent plasma, a method involving taking plasma from people who have recovered from Covid-19, for coronavirus patients.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the WHO, stressed that it was still unproven and that there was “very low evidence” it was safe and effective.“There are a number of clinical trials going on around the world looking at convalescent plasma … but only a few of them have reported on results. The results are not conclusive. The trials have been relatively small and the results in some cases point to some benefit but have not been conclusive. We have been tracking this and do ongoing … reviews to see where the evidence is shifting or pointing at and the moment it is still very low evidence,” she said.Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the WHO, warned that the side-effects of convalescent plasma ranged from mild chills and fevers to more severe lung problems and circulatory overload.”Asked about schools reopening, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead at the WHO, said that while most children had mild or asymptomatic infections, “there are young children that can develop severe disease and there are children who have died from severe infection”.She says many studies are under way to establish the risks to children and their families. “What we see from some of the preliminary results is that there is some difference in the transmission rate among the younger children and teenagers. So we do need to differentiate between different age groups,” she said.The focus should be on getting transmission down in the community, she stressed, saying “everyone has agreed how important it is that schools can reopen safely”.A question from a journalist in Bosnia, who asks whether Balkan countries should put in orders for the Russian vaccine.Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the WHO, said it would not recommend any vaccines that had not passed through its pre-qualification emergency use licensing programme.None have yet passed that milestone.There is a question at the WHO press conference about the Russian vaccine programme.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist at the WHO, said the organisation had asked the Russians to share data on efficacy. “Safety needs to be assessed short term but also long term as some side-effects are only picked up later on,” she said.There are 30 trials at various stages of development across the world, she added.Earlier this month, Russia became the first country in the world to license a coronavirus vaccine when the president, Vladimir Putin, announced its approval ahead of conventional phase 3 testing.At the time of the announcement the vaccine had not passed the advanced trials normally required to prove it works before being licensed, a major breach of scientific protocol. Russian officials claimed the vaccine would provide lasting immunity to Covid-19 but offered no proof.Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for Covid-19 at the World Health Organization, has been asked by an Australian reporter about a case of someone being reinfected with Covid after recovering.She says that while people do develop an immune response, it is not clear how long that response lasts. A lot of work is going on to establish how long this immunity lasts. Many studies are underway.She said there have been more than 24m cases recorded across the globe to date and it is important to put the reinfection case into context.“I don’t want people to be afraid. We need people to understand that if they are infected, even if it is only a mild case, they do develop an immune response,” she says.Some 172 countries are involved in the programme, he said.At a press conference (which we are carrying live on this blog), he said more money is “urgently needed to move the portfolio forward”. The goal is to deliver at least 2bn safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021.Ghebreyesus insists it is not all doom and gloom. “There is light at the end of the tunnel. As I said last week, we can do it,” he said.Thanks for following everyone. I am now handing over the blog to my colleague Helen Pidd. Below is a summary of the latest developments:The Irish prime minister, , called on European trade commissioner Phil Hogan to give the public absolute assurances he did not break Covid-19 when he travelled to a golf dinner that has caused outrage in his native Ireland.Marin said Hogan was adamant he did not breach a local lockdown while he was staying in County Kildare but given there was a discrepancy between the commissioner’s public statements on the issue, he needed to provide a full public account. “I need absolute … the public needs absolute assurances that the restrictions that were imposed in Kildare were not breached. That to me would be very, very serious indeed,” Martin, who called for Hogan to consider his position on Saturday, told national broadcaster RTE.Hello everyone.

Just more than five weeks ago Elaine Donnelly was involved in “a very minor incident where my car door hit another car door in a car park. A scuff mark existed which disappeared after polishing with a wet finger.” What happened next highlights much of what is wrong with the insurance industry in Ireland. “The other driver became irate and took a photo of my insurance details. I photographed the scuff mark on the other car, and there was no damage to my car,” she says. “I contacted my insurer to inform them, in case of a fraudulent claim. No claim has been made to date by the other driver.

He was prompted to mail us after getting an email confirming that his annual VHI travel insurance would auto-renew at the end of the month and the cost would be automatically deducted from his credit card.“I had to phone VHI and cancel, and they even then tried to put me off, telling me that I would have access to exclusive airport lounges etc,” he writes. “A friend of mine only discovered his VHI travel insurance renewed in April at the height of travel restrictions when he looked at his Visa bill. Irate, he phoned them up and got a refund. Anyway, can you give a big shoutout to VHI travel, and their auto travel insurance renewal policies. ‘We are all in this together’, except of course VHI, who are in this for the profits.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We need to rethink the value we place on the natural environmentActivist says ongoing denial about scale of crisis contrasts with urgency of Covid fightEvaluation suggests using ecosystem thresholds to develop policies is not best approach"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File Photograph: Fran VealeTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said he would like to see a “very comprehensive statement” from Phil Hogan to fully explain his position, after it emerged he was stopped driving in Kildare before attending the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne Show, Mr Martin said that given there was a discrepancy between Mr Hogan’s statements, he needed to know that the restrictions in Kildare were not breached. He said he and the Tánaiste have asked the Garda Commissioner for full details on the incident.“We are holding a light on the anger of the Irish people to what they regard as an unacceptable breach of the guidelines by people in office.”Mr Martin said he had received a call from the Minister for Justice Helen McEntee to inform him that Mr Hogan had been stopped by gardaí for using a mobile phone while he was driving in Kildare. Mr Martin said it was very serious.Gardaí were at the forefront of implementing guidelines, he added. The question was if Mr Hogan had been in full adherence of the restrictions.There was understandably a lot of anger from the public about what had happened, he said.

Photograph: Bloomberg European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has asked for further clarification from Ireland’s Commissioner Phil Hogan after receiving a dossier describing his movements in the country because “details count” a spokeswoman has said.Mr Hogan is under pressure after it emerged that initial statements by his spokesman claiming he travelled “directly” from Co Kilkenny to the controversial golf event in Co Galway were incorrect.Mr Hogan’s team have since admitted he returned to Co Kildare on his way to the golf event, to collect items from his residence at the K-Club, and was stopped by gardaí in the county for using his mobile phone while driving.A spokesman for the European Commission had on Friday also repeated that Mr Hogan travelled to Co Galway “directly”.“This is a matter that requires careful assessment on our side. This is a matter where details count. Therefore the president has requested Commission Hogan to provide a full report covering the matters,” European Commission spokeswoman Dana Spinant said.“The President has received such a report from Commissioner Hogan last night. She is now looking at it. Details are important as I said. The President has requested further clarifications because details are important and she wishes to have them.”Trade portfolioMs von der Leyen has the power to dismiss Mr Hogan, who is in charge of the vital trade portfolio at a time of crucial sensitivity amid a trade war between the United States and China and with time running out to clinch agreement with Britain about its future trade relations with the EU following Brexit.Ms Spinant said that so far the Commission’s work on trade had been able to continue, and that it was vital that this remained the case.“It’s important to ensure that nothing distracts the Commission from its very important work, in particular at these times when we need to deal with a serious crisis provoked by the Coronavirus, ” the spokeswoman said.Mr Hogan had presented a dossier to Ms von der Leyen last night and was then subsequently asked for more detail.The Commission spokeswoman indicated she expected Mr Hogan, who has yet to appear in public to take questions from journalists, would make a public appearance.“We feel for the people of Ireland who like many other people and communities in the European Union over the past months had to go through difficult times to comply with strict regulations to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. Many have lost loved ones, many have been ill and others have suffered from the restrictions,” Ms Spinant said.“So this is why it is important that rules are respected. This is a matter not just on respecting the rules but this is also a matter of public health. There are legal aspects involved and there are moral aspects involved as well.”It is understood Mr Hogan’s dossier has not yet been provided to senior members of the Irish Government.The Government will now await Ms von der Leyen’s judgment on the report and any additional information from Mr Hogan.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has not spoken to Ms von der Leyen about Mr Hogan’s future, indicating that, if she is satisfied with the former Fine Gael minister’s explanations, the Government will not seek his removal as commissioner.Officials in Dublin and Brussels said she is expected to make a decision about Mr Hogan’s future after considering his account.Ms von der Leyen, who is said by her spokesman to be “following the situation closely”, requested the detailed report from Mr Hogan about his attendance at the dinner and travel in Ireland prior to the event after new revelations emerged.Senior politiciansMr Hogan was one of more than 80 people, including a number of senior politicians and a member of the judiciary, who attend the dinner in Clifden, Co Galway last Wednesday, in apparent contravention of Covid-19 restrictions.On Monday Martin said a statement he issued on Saturday evening with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar calling for Mr Hogan to consider his position was released after emerged that he had been stopped by gardaí, Micheál Martin said on Friday.Mr Martin said on Monday he was very angry over the dinner in Galway and said it should not have happened.Mr Martin also confirmed that Dara Calleary, who resigned as Minister for Agriculture on Friday, has also resigned as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil.Yesterday Mr Hogan’s spokesman confirmed he went from Kilkenny to the K-Club on his way to Clifden last week to collect personal belongings and “essential” work papers.Mr Hogan’s spokesman said he was cautioned and he did not receive penalty points.On Saturday evening, following consultations with the Green Party leader, Eamon Ryan, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar called for Mr Hogan to “consider his position”.Uncompromising noteMr Varadkar sounded a less uncompromising note on Sunday when he said Mr Hogan’s second - and more contrite - apology “definitely helps”.However, Mr Varadkar said he needed to provide further explanations, especially about whether he may have broken the terms of the local lockdown in Co Kildare, where he has a residence at the K-Club golf resort.“He needs to answer any questions that people have,” Mr Varadkar said. “That’s not just in relation to the dinner, it’s also any questions that might arise from his movements within the country and his movements in and out of Co Kildare.”If Mr Hogan is unable to do this, “then he needs to consider his position”.Meanwhile, gardaí have been in contact with staff at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, where the Oireachtas Golf Society function was held.The Garda investigation into the gathering is focused on how the event was organised. Under current Covid-19 regulations, organising a large event is not permitted. The ban or organising an event is a penal provision meaning any proven breach is a criminal offence, though attending an event is not prohibited by law."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"White supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ministry defence told make new 15bn fleet ships britain","story":"The Ministry of Defence must make the new £1.5billion fleet of ships in Britain otherwise the UK is at risk of losing its shipbuilding skills forever, Labour has warned. \u2028The warning comes after the MoD asked potential suppliers to take part in market engagement about the major contract to build three Fleet Solid Support (FSS) ships that will help keep the Royal Navy\u0027s new aircraft carriers at sea, providing them with stores such as ammunition and food.The “prior information notice” on the MoD contracts website adds that it is open to “UK and international suppliers or consortiums offering a UK or international ship design, who are capable of either priming, providing a design andor integrating or building FSS ships”.Five years ago the Government announced it would build three support ships, although an order is yet to be placed, meanwhile the National Audit Office recently highlighted the lack of support ships as a potential weakness in the MoD’s plans for the deployment of the carriers.\u2028John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, told The : “If we fail to back British skills we risk losing them for good and weakening both our security and industrial base for the future.” Mr Healey accused defence ministers of having “dithered over this decision” for five years, “when it’s a no-brainer to build these vital new ships in Britain”. \u2028“They are selling Britain short by not putting the work into UK shipyards.

Britain’s second largest city, Birmingham, is also facing local restrictions, amid a recent spike in cases. But Prof  John Clancy, of Birmingham City University, said putting the city into lockdown would be lunacy and warned current fears of a second wave were based on dodgy data.“According to the Government’s own testing figures, 87 of Birmingham’s 132 neighbourhoods did not record a single tested positive case of Covid-19 in the last week, so 716,000 Brummies live in a neighbourhood where there were no positive tests in the last week.“Fifty-three of the neighbourhoods (418,000 people) have not recorded a single case in the last 4 weeks. Forty-six neighbourhoods (371,000 people) have not recorded a single case in the last 8 weeks.”Prof Clancy, who is also the former leader of Birmingham city council, said the current testing numbers were low and unreliable and that testing in Britain was now in total chaos. “They are all over the place. And policy responses based on it will be chaos too,” he warned.“If the so-called spikes in places like Birmingham lead to reported Covid-19 hospital admissions or reported Covid-19 deaths, then there is cause for alarm. “But the reality is that increased and more widespread testing is leading, oddly enough, to finding more cases. This has not broadly led to increases in Covid-19 related deaths and hospital admissions in other so-called hotspots.”Last week Birmingham was placed on the national watch list by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and given ‘enhanced support’ to help prevent a lockdown. But there has been just one death recorded in the city in the past week and on Sunday, just six deaths were recorded for the whole of Britain. There are currently 834 patients in hospital with coronavirus, and 72 on ventilators.  Birmingham police said it had issued dozens of reminders of the need for social distancing after being called to more than 70 street and house parties and other unlicensed gatherings overnight.The force tweeted that they had dispersed dozens of parties, including one at Northfield on the outskirts of Birmingham which included two marquees and a DJ.“Everyone packed up and went home after we arrived,” Birmingham Police tweeted. “Please understand we are still in a pandemic.”In a separate tweet, the force said officers had ‘responded to over 70 street and house parties and other unlicensed events’ on Saturday night.The National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council has warned that forces in England and Wales will continue to increase patrols heading into the bank holiday weekend. Areas of concern, such as Leicester and Greater Manchester, have seen deployments larger than on New Year\u0027s Eve, it said.But Prof Clancy said: “So-called ‘spikes’ are occurring here, there, and everywhere up and down the country because new testing regimes are causing them either with false positives, picking up residual infections or (usually more likely) suddenly increased testing in specific areas.“‘Just in case’ lockdowns are simply not an acceptable response to dodgy data.

Addressing his earlier projects, Theroux analysed his presenting style, which he said had a tendency to “be glib, to disarm with the aim of making light of people’s deeply held beliefs, to act the clown, to make fun”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“That was part of how I saw my role, to be the straight man in a weird world, and there were times, looking back, when I see I may have gone too far,” he wrote. However, Theroux then pointed out that it was the mistakes he made in the past that enabled him to become the presenter he is today. “They suggested the possibility of doing things differently,” he said. “After 25-plus years of doing my job, what strikes me is the development and evolution that has taken place. When I started out in 1994, it would have seemed ludicrous to imagine having the maturity, sensitivity and storytelling chops to make programmes about disability, mental health and addiction.”Theroux will present a new four-part series next month, titled Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge, which will look back at his body of work ning 25 years.The series will include interviews with Theroux as well as new conversations and catch-ups with some of his most memorable or notorious contributors.

It’s been a strange and fascinating couple of months working on this, and especially fun to dig through old episodes of Weird Weekends - programmes I made in the mid-90s, when the world was a very different place.“I’m really proud of what we’ve been able to do with this new series. I think we’ve been able to make the whole add up to more than the sum of the parts and to bring out surprising themes and commonalities. And, if nothing else, it was an interesting review of how my haircuts and glasses have changed over the years.”Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge will air on BBC2 in September.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Some things are good and some are bad.FactCheck Twitter feed“I’d like to think the UK is not as bad as in other countries – the US is leading the way with that very muddy space.”In separate research, the fact-checking organisation First Draft found that Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats all published misleading advertising during the campaign.But the Tories were “by far the most frequent”, with 88 per cent of their most shared online adverts between 1 and 4 December containing misleading information, compared to 6.7 per cent for Labour.King’s College researchers said it was “difficult to calculate” whether the efforts had an impact on the election result, which saw Boris Johnson returned as prime minister with a majority increased by 47 seats.Tories set up fake fact-checking service for election debateThey warned that the coronavirus pandemic could operate as a measure of public trust in the governing party, adding: “On a daily basis, the government is trying to persuade British citizens that its reported death tolls are accurate.“It wants citizens to believe the message that it is ‘succeeding’ in controlling the epidemic, despite its recent electoral record of using disinformation tactics and admitting it unapologetically.”A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said it rejected what it called “wild assertions”.“All Conservative Party advertising was labelled, following best practice on digital imprints,” he added.“We are delivering on the promises the British public elected us on, getting Brexit done, investing in our public services and levelling-up across the country.“The research classed disinformation as a deliberate lie or misrepresentation, while misinformation can be created or spread accidentally.Dr Granelli said there was a perception that disinformation was “happening at a more industrial rate than has ever happened before” amid a global rise in online communications.Conservatives post misleading edited campaign video of Labour ministerBut she warned that it was hard to measure the impact on voting behaviour because the reasons for people’s decisions, or behind the views they form, were not fully known.Dr Granelli noted that the period since the 2016 EU referendum, which has seen two general elections, two Conservative and two Labour leadership elections, has meant party-political campaigning “continuing for a lot longer than it normally would”.The report called for more research to be done across multiple platforms to examine how false information spreads and takes root, calling claims that “Facebook, or bots, or the Russians are the core threat” a “misdiagnosis” of the problem.“A lot of the time, people are looking for information that reinforces their beliefs,” Dr Granelli said.“It might be their friends, parents, newspapers, celebrities or musicians.“It’s almost a perfect storm – the old gatekeepers have been removed and we haven’t found the right way to replace them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But celebration must be tempered with pragmatism: The scarring effects of lockdown will be felt for months,not years, to come.For a full recovery, we must all make a concerted effort to shore up the economy by going out to work, pubs and the shops.JUSTICE Jeremy Baker, who sentenced Manchester Arena co-conspirator Hashem Abedi to a record  years behind bars, is a credit to our justice system.Working with his brother, bomber Salman Abedi, the depraved criminal inflicted unimaginable suffering on innocent young victims and their families.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And lockdowns cause deaths.”Government scientists have warned that another national shutdown could cases spike.Many nations in Europe - such as France and Spain - are seeing a rise in cases. Some towns and cities are also facing the threat of local lockdowns, such as Birmingham - which has seen  cases in the last week.Professor Clancy, who is also the former leader of Birmingham City Council, warned current testing numbers are low and unreliable.He said: The reality is that increased and more widespread testing is leading, oddly enough, to finding more cases. This has not broadly led to increases in Covid- related deaths and hospital admissions in other so-called hotspots.Birmingham has been placed on the national watch list by Health Secretary Matt Hancock after a rise in cases.Police have been cracking down on enforcing social distancing, and said last night they were called to more than  street and house parties.However, Professor Clancy said the government data shows  of Birminghams  neighbourhoods did not record a single positive case of coronavirus last week.He also pointed out the apparent  per cent jump in the number of casesper , over the past two weeks is actually just an increase of six people. The expert said: These are micro-numbers, and talking about them in terms of spikes just won’t do. It is certainly not enough to spark policy change.He warned local officials risk over-reacting to apparent spikes.And he said the decisions should be taken by national government as city politicians do not have a signicant enough democratic mandate.   Professor Clancy explained he backed hyper-local intervention to try and beat the coronavirus.And he added officials should only be alarmedthere is a spike in deaths, saying theyare sadly the most reliable figure during the pandemic.Britain recorded six deaths today, while England recorded a new low of one.He said: What you can’t have is local lockdown panic without a wider context. Otherwise you’ll get ridiculous decisions to lockdown completely unrelated to the actual risk.Hyper-local intervention in very local areas of concern is a much better future option. Shutting down regions and cities will be ineffective, and has already been seen to be so.He added: Until we get our testing, and track and tracing system, into proper, reliable shape we should not be basing policy on it.Fears have surfaced of second nationwide coronavirus lockdown as officials warned the end of the year will be bumpy for Britain.The Sage advisory group said Britain’s reproduction number was between . and ., with senior sources warning “more nationwide measures” may be needed. A senior government source told The : We’re looking at a pretty bumpy autumn and winter and that’s going to go in the direction of increased cases and increased outbreaks.Another source added: “If it doesn’t get contained it may be that some things that have been open, you need to think about whether measures need to be taken to reverse things.Government scientists fear Britain could follow countries like Spain, Europe’s fastest rising caseload, with  cases per , people. The number of daily cases in the holiday hotspot have risen from  when lockdown eased on June  to more than ,.National figures showed that one person died from coronavirus today in England, as the UK confirmed , new cases.Emergency plans have been drawn up to protect the UK from the perfect storm of a winter second wave of Covid- coinciding with a No Deal Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Strict rules do not work as people seem to break them.The Scandinavian country recorded  new cases on Friday and  on Saturday.Stefan Lofven, the prime minister, insisted on Friday their response to the pandemic was right.He told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter: The strategy that we adopted, I believe is right - to protect iniduals, limit the spread of the infection.What has been discussed most, and what we did dferently in Sweden, was that we did not close schools. Now there are quite a few people who think we were right.From the beginning in the global outbreak, Sweden introduced voluntary social-distancing rules, home-working and recommendations for people to avoid public transport.The compulsory measures that were brought in included a ban on gatherings of more than  people, restrictions on visiting care homes, and table-only service in bars and restaurants.However, the decision to not lockdown has come with consequences.A total of , Swedes have died of Covid- - signicantly higher than its neighbours Norway,Denmark and Finland.Anders Tegnell, the top epidemiologist leading the response to Swedens pandemic, claimed the infection rates of Spain, Belgium and France have increased after mask mandates in public spaces came in. He said last week: The belief that masks can solve our problem is very dangerous.When looking at the total number of people infected since the pandemic began, Sweden has one of the highest figures in Europe with  cases per ,.That is more than double of France - recording  cases per ,.However, Dr Tegnell claims the higher level of cases indicates a form of immunity among the population by people carrying antibodies for Covid-.Dr Tegnell told the Unherd website last month: What we are seeing now in Sweden is a rapid decline in the number of cases, and of course some sort of immunity must be responsible for that since nothing  has changed.A study published last week by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm people who test negative for antibodies may still have a high level of immunity.Dr Tegnell said: I think it is likely that such outbreaks will be easier to control in Sweden because there is immunity among the population.Professor Marcus Buggert, an immunologist at the institute, said: T-cells are a type of white blood cells that are specialised in recognising virus-infected cells. Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in.Earlier this month, the BBC pointed out that Swedens antibody rate is fairly similar to the UKs.The broadcaster said it compared with  per cent of Londoners found with coronavirus antibodies when tested in April and May, and five-to-ten per cent of people living in Geneva.Sweden has faced sharp criticism for the governments decision to not lockdown.

The words are: Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves, Britons never never never shall be slaves.The song originates from the poem Rule, Britannia by James Thomson and was set to music by Thomas Arne in .The original poem consisted of six verses - all of six lines each.The song, however, performed at the Last Night Of The Proms, has been cut to just the first three verses with the refrain of Rule Britannia repeated.When Britain first, at Heavens commandArose from out the azure mainArose, arose from out the azure mainThis was the charter, the charter of the land,And  angels sang this strain:Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.The nations, not so blest as thee,Must, in their turns, to tyrants fallMust, in their turns, to tyrants fallWhile thou shalt flourish, shalt flourish great and free,The dread and envy of them all.Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.Still more majestic shalt thou rise,More dreadful, from each foreign strokeMore dreadful, dreadful from each foreign strokeAs the loud blast, the blast that tears the skies,Serves but to root thy native oak.Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.Thee haughty tyrants neer shall tame:All their attempts to bend thee down,All their attempts to bend thee downWill but arouse, arouse thy generous flameBut work their woe, and thy renown.Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.To thee belongs the rural reignThy cities shall with commerce shineThy cities shall with commerce shine:All thine shall be the subject main,And every shore it circles thine.Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.The Muses, still with freedom found,Shall to thy happy coast repairShall to thy happy coast repairOh blest Isle! With matchless beauty crownd,And manly hearts to guard the fair.Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.The patriotic song has caused a stir after the BBC considered dropping it from the Last Night Of The Proms. Rule Britannia has been called out for having links to colonialism and slavery in its lyrics - and in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, has been deemed controversial.The patriotic classic could be dropped from the BBC Proms - and because of Covid- restrictions, bosses have seen it as an opportunity to make the change. Prof Kehinde Andrews, from the School of Social Sciences at Birmingham City University, insisted both Rule Britannia and Land Of Hope And Glory should no longer be played due to their racist propaganda connotations.The academic said on Good Morning Britain: Ban is the wrong word, its not censorship.Its saying some songs, particularly those two, are racist propaganda which celebrates the British Empire which killed tens of millions people, many of which like myself are descendants of those victims of colonialism.Its totally inappropriate, its not about banning and censorship, its about saying what songs do we want to represent us.If, and its a big , we do want an anti-racist Britain then songs like these should not be celebrated in the proms.Rule, Britannia! was originally a poem, written by James Thomson, but was set to music in .The song is closely associated with the Royal Navy, and is also used by the British Army.It was written as Britains naval and political supremacy was slowly growing, following the beginning of constitutional monarchy in  - which contrasted with the strict royal absolutism of France at the time.The song contains lots of symbols of colonialism and racism - especially in the refrain: Rule, Britannia! rule the waves, Britons never will be slaves.Critics have said that saying Britons will never be slaves implies that its okay for others to be enslaved - which is what Brits were doing at the time of its composition in the th century.By the s, Britain was exporting half of the worlds slaves in the triangular trade, forming much of the base of the British Empire.At the time of the songs release, Liverpools slave ships made around  voyages a year, while Bristols ports averaged at . Slave ship owners and the owners of Caribbean plantations, most of who lived in Britain, became very wealthy and influential in government and society because of their exploits.The haughty tyrants lyric, which has also been blasted, references when Brits would invade foreign lands and call the native people tyrants - perpetuating the out-dated concept that Brits are superior to other races and people.British naval power was also equated to civil liberty - and the song assumed extra signicance in  at the end of World War II when it was played at the ceremonial surrender of the Japanese imperial army in Singapore.Classical music critic Richard Morrison said in a column for BBC Music Magazine last month: In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, it would surely be insensitive, bordering on the incendiary, to roar out these hypocritical th-century words, with or without irony.Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke!, an orchestra whose musicians are majority black, Asian and ethnically erse, criticised the song: It’s so irrelevant to today’s society.

Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: The union leaders that Iaposm talking to all the time are as desperate as anyone to see children back in class. Theyaposre education professionals, theyaposre teachers, they really care as much as anybody about childrenaposs futures and it isnapost the responsibility of the trade unions ultimately to get children into the classroom. The Government has to make the conditions suitable and safe for schools, for staff, for students and itaposs been asleep at the wheel, itaposs been not paying the attention that schools need to the details of how they are going to reopen, nor has it been out sending a strong and clear message to parents. She added: “Itaposs essential children go back to schoolfor... their wellbeing, their learning and their long-term le opportunities. But really in terms of making preparations for their , while headteachers, principals and school staff have been working really hard over the last few weeks of the summer holidays to make the schools safe, I think the Government has been missing in action.” NAHT union general secretary Paul Whiteman urged ministers to engage with families to help pupils . He said: The Governmentaposs back-to-school campaign has really got to engage with parents, let parents know what to do, and to make sure that parents know what to do around the school as well to make sure all of the measures being taken in school are as secure as they can be. It came as Dr Jenny Harries, Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer,  said that the risk for teachers in schools is probably highest between staff. Dr Harries also said it would be unlikely that there would be a scenario where all schools across the country would be forced to close again. But in areas subject to a local lockdown there could be inidual schools forced to close. She said that no environment is risk free but added that the risk to children was higher from seasonal flu compared to the current risks posed by Covid-. And she said that a single case in a school bubble may not lead to the whole bubble being forced into isolation. The comments come after the UKaposs chief medical officers issued a joint statement seeking to reassure parents that it was safe to send their children back to school.  Dr Harries told Sky News: We think itaposs vitally important that school stay open but obviously when itaposs safe to do so. There will be rare occurrences where we may recommend that a school closes, and that will be relatedcommunity transmission rates, rather than necessarily from the school itself. We think that transmission risks within the school are low, as long as the measures that have been recommended are put in place. But where you get rising transmission rates... then obviously we may make an inidual recommendation for a school but increasingly that will be very localised. Itaposs very unlikely that we would see all schools closing down at one go. She added: So weaposre not saying it, no environment is completely risk-free. Every time the parents send their child off to school pre-Covid they may have been involved in a road traffic accident, there are all sorts of things. And in fact that risk or the risk from seasonal flu, we think is probably higher than the current risks of Covid. On coronavirus transmission rates, she said that community transmission risk is far more important than schools. Dr Harries added: The transmission from younger children - when teachers are perhaps more likely to be closer to them - is much lower. Actually in the studies that have been done so far, the risk probably of transmission between staff, rather than to or from children, is the one that teachers perhaps should be focusing on - so itaposs going off for a coffee break, you know, dropping your guard down. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she added that the majority of cases in schools were from staff-to-staff interactions. She added: I think itaposs really important to reassure teachers on that count, but also to encourage them. When itaposs their coffee break and they get a well-earned rest in the day, to ensure that they maintain their social distancing, good hand-hygiene, all those sorts of things while they have their break because that does seem to be a risk factor. When askedone case was detected in a school bubble she replied: These systems are set up very much that as soon as an inidual cases detected - as long as thataposs reported through Test and Trace and through Public Health England - contact tracing will go on.

YES, you are correct, without you and your custom I may very well be out of a job right now BUT you must remember that without us you would be without a holiday, it’s a two way street. “. NOWHERE is ‘IMMUNE’ to COVID-. The amount of times I have been told by you that you’ve come down to Cornwall because we are immune to it and you just want a break from everything is absurd. “. SOCIAL DISTANCING STILL APPLIES. See the above point, we are not immune and we certainly do not have the capacity in our hospital for you to act like we are. For your own safety as well as ours, please try and keep your distance. “. WE ARE STILL HUMAN. This brings me to my main point. I have come home from what was a reasonably short and supposedly easy sht today feeling totally defeated and lost for words. We cannot control Covid. I am not the creator of the rules so please don’t belittle me and call me stupid, idiotic or a b*tch just because you have to book a slot for the swimming pool or need to wear a mask for a mere  minutes in the shop. You wouldn’t like itI responded to you in the same way.  “. Lastly, ENJOY YOUR STAY! Be grateful that in these times you have been lucky enough to travel and have a slight sense of normality in booking a holiday. For many people this is something they could only have wished for. We love having you here and are grateful that you are keeping our economy up and running and we thank you for it. “BUT PLEASE. NEXT TIME YOU GO TO TAKE YOUR ANGER OUT ON A STAFF MEMBER ANYWHERE YOU GO. REMEMBER. WE ARE HUMANS TOO.” What people said after reading the letter Her post has been shared almost , times with many people congratulating Beth for speaking out. One woman replied: “I have recently ed from a week in Cornwall and I have nothing but praise for the locals for observing and enforcing the rules for social distancing as we did. The same cannot be said however for the incredibly inconsiderate idiots who have inflicted themselves on the lovely Cornish people. “They were behaving as though the virus had never happened, no social distancing, no masks and no courtesy evident at all. I pray that their behaviour does not harm the loveliest county and itaposs equally lovely people. “As someone who works in the NHS it broke my heart. Stay safe everyone.” Beth told Cornwall Live: “We had to close the pool yesterday for a safety reason and people were saying we’d ruined their holiday, taken their fun away from them and weren’t making enough effort. “I’ve worked at the holiday park for the past couple of summers – you get the odd complaint but it’s never been like this. It’s like they’ve come on holiday for a break and everything’s okay down here – but it’s not. I’m trying to keep my cool with them….” She added: “Yesterday I had four people be rude to me. I had to cry in the staff room because it was so nasty.” It was when she ed home from that sht that she took to Facebook. Beth said cleaners, managers and leguards at the holiday park have also been at the receiving end of rude and aggressive behaviour. “I would not have chosen to work in this industryI didn’t want tourists to come to Cornwall, but it’s almost got to the point where I’m like … ‘please go home’.

Not the PM’s cynical lying, not the arrogance and not the laziness – though these are all per­­ilous traits reinforcing his unsuitability for high office – but the grotesque ineptitude of a harmfully useless charlatan. This is the chancer who flies by the seat of his privileged pants, who demonstrated a frightening lack of concern for the aspirations of millions of children over testing. People who, foolishly, cut Johnson a bit of slack over sky-high virus death tolls and dire financial damage aren’t giving him the benefit of the doubt over the entirely avoidable BTEC, GCSE and A-level shambles. It’s why Starmer is now preferred to Johnson as PM in polls and, nine months after an election drubbing, the Labour Party has inched to within a couple of points of the Conservatives.One-time chief prosecutor Starmer is widely viewed as competent, while ex-magazine editor Johnson is seen as incompetent.Starmer successfully ran the hugely complex Crown Prosecution Service.Johnson was forced to apologise for mistakes at the Spectator, once dubbed The Sextator. Just as voters cared about the Back to Basics tawdry hypocrisy during John Major’s tortuous long goodbye in the s, Starmer is betting on people becoming fed up with Johnson’s stumbling in the s. The PM who gted a free pass to rule-breaker Dominic Cummings, promoted a crony behind a test-and-trace system reaching only half of contacts and is overseeing a regime stained by corruption allegations isn’t going to wake up any morning soon as a newly able leader.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

Industry chiefs fear , jobs are at riskthe nighttime sector is forced to stay closed. Now the Night Time Industries Association says afor clubs and venues is possible as the sector reaches a critical point. It warns % of businesses could permanently close by next monthsomething isnapost done. Now proposals by the Institute of Occupational Medicine for the nightclub industry says bouncers would patrol the inside of venues and make sure people are staying apart. Temperature checks will be done at the doors, customers would have to give their details for track-and-trace and face masks would have to be worn. The report states: “Use of face coverings on the dancefloor can be implemented and enforced through existing security staff and protocols.” The association said the night-time economy was one of the few remaining sectors without any clear path to reopening and has urged the Government to save the sector from collapse. The report said there is a strong argument to permit clubs to reopen under strict controls bearing in mind the behaviour we are witnessing in unregulated environments such as beaches, parks and raves.  It added: Whilst there are some areas of increased risks over other sectors there are many real benefits that such businesses have over other sectors, particularly as all our venues have security to give % cover of matters such as temperature checks, track and trace, and keeping customer behaviour in check. There are also sector specic measures which venues can put in place which would put them at least on a par with other businesses which are allowed to open. Michael Kill, chief executive of the association, said: We have now reached a critical point.

Pupils have already missed out on schooling because of the lockdown and risk falling behind still furtherthe disruption continues. The Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, speaks sense when he says children are more likely to be harmed by not attending school than from catching coronavirus. What is missing is not the will but the reassurance. Parents and teachers need to know that every effort has been made to make sure pupils and staff are safe. They also want clarication on what will happenthere is a further spike in infections. This requires leadership. Unfortunately, we have been lumbered with one of the worst Education Secretaries ever to hold the post.Few have confidence in Gavin Williamson, especially now we know he took a jaunt to the seaside at the height of the exams fiasco.

She describes herself as a Plain Jane and says she was a geek, but in the years since sheaposs undergone a complete transformation, both mentally and physically, and is much happier for it. In fact, Roxy is now so dferent that she claims many of her old classmates donapost recognise her when she runs into them in her home city Cardf. At , sheaposs now a bikini model and has recently retrained as a personal trainer, and is proud of the outgoing adult sheaposs become. She said: “You wouldn’t recognise me physically and mentallyyou knew me when I was at school - a lot of people don’t. “I was really skinny growing up - my legs were just as thick as my arms. Now I’ve got an athletic figure and I’m a completely dferent person. I was painfully shy as a child. I was a geek and academic and didn’t get into trouble. “I had a bit of acne and never wore makeup because my dad didn’t like it - so I wasn’t really able to explore it. I was a bit of a plain Jane.  “Things changed when I went to sixth form and I was put with people I didn’t know. I was forced to talk and thrown in the deep end. “When I was  I bought a self-help book and that really started to build my confidence. “That and more le experience have made me a dferent person. It has been a gradual process but wearing makeup and glamming myself did help.  “If you feel confident on the inside, you feel confident on the outside. After finishing school Roxy studied health nutrition at university and got a number of office jobs. But her confidence started to grow when she began lting weights about four years ago and saw how her body was changing. Teaching herself with YouTube videos and books she quickly turned her skinny physique into a sleek athletic one which motivated her further to start wearing makeup and doing her hair. She went on to enter bikini competitions before qualying as a personal trainer three years ago - something she initially did part-time. But since being furloughed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Roxy has now dedicated all of her time to her passion and is hoping to turn it into a full-time career.This involves her confidently speaking to strangers - something she’d never have done as a teenager. And the transformation has given her a more lucrative career, as well as a new lease of le.  She said: “I make more money per hour doing personal training. My office job was £ an hour but personal training is around £ an hour so there’s potential to make a lot more money. “Before lockdown I was working  hours a week. I worked from .am until pm so I could only train people before or after work or on the weekend.

Paying up a the end off your weekly shop becomes a personal challenge to try and bag the items as quickly as the cashier is scanning them - and itaposs one youaposre likely to lose. With a queue of keen spectators looking on, many shoppers crack under the pressure - but one mum has revealed she simply doesnapost give them the chance.  Aldi customers have previously shared hilarious hacks to slow down the checkout staff, including one who advised scrunching up the packaging around the barcode so it wouldnapost scan first time. Others said they preferred to work in teams, with one slowly handing the items over one at a time at the till while the other packs. But sometimesyou donapost ask, you donapost get - and thataposs exactly what one mum said she does in a discussion on the Aldi Mums Facebook page. You can ask them to slow down, I do, she said. They don’t mind. And never had a rude checkout operator either.  And it turns out plenty of others have been doing the same, as another said: I always ask the checkout workers at my local ALDI to slow down a bit, so I don’t get overwhelmed. They always say yes and it’s always very pleasant, never had a problem. But for others the sheer panic of racing to pack was all part of the Aldi experience, as reported by Kidspot. One argued: Keeping up with the ALDI checkout workers is a game for me. It should be an Olympic sport.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The city deserves recognition for its proactive eco-friendly approach that we’ve taken to get to this point.“It’s clear this is, in no small part, down to how ahead of the curve we are on electrical charging provision and how widely accessible we’ve made that throughout the city.”City Development Vice Convener Councillor Steven Rome, added: “The research highlights some interesting factors in how Dundee is achieving such good results.“The regular access to recycling facilities throughout the high street and city centre allows us to maximise our contributions. In addition to this, the high number of parks and green spaces in the city reflects just how nature-led Dundee is, as a whole.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

As people we believe that positivity becomes a state of mind with daily reinforcements.“In these unprecedented times, Be open to the Joy you deserve takes on an even deeper meaning as a talisman of hope and good karma, as we navigate  and manest a future with limitless opportunities for more joy.#We hope this mantra will be a positive affirmation to the people of Dundee, and serve as a reminder to be open to the feeling of joy even in these challenging times.” vw, px\"  Kirsty Hassard, VA Dundee curator, said: “Christopher Kane’s message of joy at VA Dundee is for everyone as we adapt to le during a global pandemic.#The exhibition also includes a bespoke Quarantine Bread Baking Barbie created by Tonya Ruiz as part of her Quarantine Barbie #BarbieGetsReal series on her Instagram account.Some designs featured in the exhibition are in use throughout the museum, adapting the building to be safe and welcoming for visitors and staff.Door handles across the museum have been adapted using D printed design solutions by Belgian company Materialise, created during the pandemic so doors can be opened with an arm, rather than by hand.The exhibition shows how this can be a moment for positive change, with design helping us to imagine a dferent world after the pandemic, a world that is more connected, sustainable, and equitable than before.Now Accepting Contactless is displayed inside and outside VA Dundee, centred on the Michelin Design Gallery.The exhibition has been curated by VA Dundee with the museum’s Young People’s Collective.All visitors to VA Dundee need to book a free, timed entry ticket in advance at www.vam.ac.uk dundee For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The vehicle was in the Premier Inn car park and given his presentation and the smell of alcohol, they were under the impression that he was under the influence.”Ovenstone was taken to police headquarters just before am where he refused to provide two specimens of breath.He stated: “If you hadn’t treated me like crap I wouldn’t be so disrespectful.”Appearing from custody, Ovenstone pleaded guilty to breaching his curfew by being out with his home after pm and before am and refusing to provide the specimens of breath.Defence solicitor Paul Parker-Smith said Ovenstone and his cousin had been drinking the previous evening when they became “hungry”.Mr Parker-Smith said: “It seemed to have gone well in the sense that he was served.“He realised he may have been over the limit and took the foolish decision to refuse a specimen of breath.”Sherf George Way deferred sentence on Ovenstone for reports to be prepared and disqualied him from driving on an interim basis. He was released on bail.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

With more than four months of the year still to go, the statistics already exceed the total for the whole of last year when  incidents were discovered and  in .Recycling centres in Aberdeenshire were closed to the public during the national lockdown but were reopened on an appointment-only basis on June .However, reports of illegal dumping continued after that point, with  recorded in June and  in July.Fridges, mattresses, car tyres, washing machines, ovens, TVs, asbestos and other construction waste were amongst the items discarded.Earlier this year, toys, wooden pallets, tyres, electrical equipment and black bags were left in the wooded area outside Chapel of Garioch.And in a separate incident, items suspected to have been covered in asbestos were dumped beside Oyne, and are thought to have been there since before Christmas.The figures were obtained by Banff and Buchan MP David Duguid. A total of  of the incidents this year – more than a third – relate to towns and villages in his constituency.Aberdeenshire Council also revealed that no-one has been prosecuted for fly-tipping in  to date.Mr Duguid said: #These figures confirm that we are experiencing a surge in fly-tipping this year in Aberdeenshire.#I am very disappointed to see that my own constituency accounts for more than a third of all incidents.#There is no excuse for dumping waste like this. Those responsible show no respect for our countryside and no remorse for the misery they cause.#Their irresponsible and illegal behaviour is an unfair burden on the taxpayer, as it is the council that is usually left to clear up their mess. In other cases, farmers and landowners are left with hefty bills.#The re-opening of the council skips on June  appears to have made little dference, with hundreds of incidents since then.#It is also very concerning to hear that no-one has been prosecuted.#I know Covid- has led to huge backlogs in the courts, but people should not be allowed to get away with this.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

He’s the type of striker we wanted because he can play with Main, with Cosgrove and with Edmondson once they are back.“Marley has speed and is such a good mover across the pitch.“He can play where, but for us he signed as a centre-forward and he is here to bring us that speed at the top end of the pitch.”Aberdeen secured a second successive win via second half goals from Lewis Ferguson and Scott Wright to go into Thursday’s Euro clash with NSI Runavik on a positive note.However, McInnes will be in a sweat over first team stars Scott McKenna, Niall McGinn and Craig Bryson for that Europa League first qualying round tie at Pittodrie.Scotland defender McKenna was sick at half-time against Livi and was replaced, while Bryson felt his calf in the warm-up.McGinn will today undergo a scan on an ankle injury suffered in the - defeat of St Johnstone.McInnes said: “Scott was sick at half-time and we decided to take him off. I think he’ll be OK for Tuesday’s training.“It was far from ideal at half-time, but thankfully it looks to be no drama.“Niall took a knock against St Johnstone and was still sore and tender on Saturday. We ruled him out for this game and he is having a scan on Monday, but we’re hopeful there’s nothing there and it settles down for Thursday. Craig felt his calf tighten in the warm-up, so we hope it’s not too serious.“I don’t think anyone who was involved today, other than McGinn, will be a doubt for Thursday.”Meanwhile, Welsh international Watkins has vowed to give his all to make the loan deal until January a success.Watkins said: “I will play my heart out for the team.“There are so much exciting things to challenge for with Aberdeen over the next few months, including European football.“It was a no-brainer for me really.“In football you have to move on to the next thing, be ambitious and try to win as much as you can.“I know all about Scottish football. I know the league and what it is all about.“There is no better feeling than being part of a team and playing for your team-mates, all being in it together.Dons boss McInnes has been a long-term admirer of Watkins and had attempted to secure him previously.The -year-old admits working with McInnes was another big draw in signing the loan deal.He said: “I have a massive amount of respect for the gaffer here.“ He has had a great managerial career and has done great things here at Aberdeen.“It will be great to learn from him. As a player you are always learning and trying improve your game.“I really am looking forward to it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Wait ages for one and suddenly three turn up at once.The three were also available for yesterday#s home victory against Livingston.Just  hours after completing a loan move from Bristol City, attacker Marley Watkins was thrown in at the deep end leading the line.Striker Bruce Anderson, unavailable for the Perth clash, was also back.Then there was a further boost just minutes before kick-off, with Curtis Main added to the squad when Craig Bryson felt his calf in the warm-up.Main had been out since knee surgery in the summer and also suffered a thigh strain during his rehabilitation.His appearance off the bench against Liv surely gives McInnes the option of going with two up top against NSI Runavik.New signing Marley Watkins was thrown straight into the action at Pittodrie just  hours after completing his loan move from Bristol City.Welsh international Watkins # who can also be played out wide # has had just  minutes of action since January, but he looked sharp and fast while leading the attack.On the basis of this debut, he can deliver goals and assists for Aberdeen. He was only denied a debut goal yesterday because of a brilliant double block from Livi keeper Robbie McCrorie.The stopper is the twin brother of Reds midfielder-defender Ross McCrorie.Aberdeen’s last appearance at Pittodrie was initially a cause for celebration as football ed to the stadium for the first time in more than five months due to the Covid- pandemic.It quickly turned sour with a turgid performance in a - loss to Rangers followed by the actions of the Aberdeen eight in attending a busy city centre bar on the night of that defeat.That plunged the Reds’ season into early chaos, but with two straight wins # away at St Johnstone and at home against Livi # they are getting it back on track, although there could be a further setback with the SFA serving notices of complaint to the eight players.They could be hit with bans of between two to eight games at Friday’s principle hearing.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Butthe free traders and corporate influencers in Westminster get their way and deregulate the law that currently governs genetic engineering there, gene edited foods could be green lighted, unlabelled, for English plates, so that most people wouldnrsquot realise that they were eating them.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would then be put under heavy international corporate pressure to do the same.Like the old guard, now stigmatised, genetically modiedfood before it, with its unhappy history of failures to deliver and creation of new problems, such as the creation of herbicide-resistant super-weeds, proponents of gene editing spin futuristic yarns about all the miracles theyrsquore rustling up for us.Less starchy potatoes and corn, pork from super-muscly pigs, spicy tomatoes, and mushrooms that resist browning, are some front runners. In fact the mushrooms have already bypassed US Department of Agriculture regulation.How can this second wave of genetically engineered foods be a realistic prospect when the first lot were so unpopular in the UK and the EU that the general public shunned them Proponents claim that gene editing is a precise, safe technology with predictable outcomes. Sound familiar  They say that theyrsquore only making very small changes to the genetic make-up of foods, merely mimicking what might happen through natural mutation.Tellingly, they seek patents for these altered foods. Patents are only grantedyou can show an inventive step that is man-made. So claims that gene editing is simply causing changes that could happen naturally go out the window.Donrsquot worry, though, they assure us that gene editing carries no more risk than conventional breeding. In fact, there is no evidence to support this blaseacute assertion because no feeding studies have been carried out in either humans or animals.Along with scientists from around the world, I attended a briefing on gene editing led by the London-based molecular geneticist Dr Michael Antoniou. It left me deeply concerned. He flagged up the growing body of gold standard scientic research that highlights the unintended and potentially dangerous risks that gene edited foods pose. Far from being precise and predictable, these lab-based, articial interventions damage plant or animal DNA, not just at the intended site of the genetic alteration, but where.For instance, it emerged last year that a hornless bull gene edited by a Minnesota company was unintentionally contaminated by bacterial genes from another species. https:www.technologyreview     recombinetics-gene-edited-hornless-cattle-major-dna-screwup Gene editing alters how genes , which can create new allergens and toxins. The European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility ndash  leading international scientists ndash has expressed grave concerns. They say that the radical nature of gene edited changes could result in ldquounexpectedly high levels of known toxins, or even in the creation of novel ones.So, the bottom line here is that therersquos a push to slip gene edited food ingredients into our food, unlabelled, most likely sneakily lost in multi-ingredient, ultra-processed foods, on the assumption that they pose no risk. So far, the general public is blissfully unaware of it.To ensure public safety and the integrity of the food we eat, its absolutely vital that all ingredients from gene edited crops, plants, or farm animals, be subjected to risk assessment of the most stringent nature.These novel creations must be tightly regulated, with track and trace systems in place so that in the case of a genetically engineered public health disaster, retailers can put out effective product recalls.Most crucially, gene edited food must be clearly labelled as genetically modied so that we can choose for ourselveswersquore prepared to eat it.

It rains there, too, and the thinking is as wild as in any war poem. Summerwater is lighter on its feet but no less anxious than Mossrsquos  masterpiece Ghost Wall. Good stories grow anywhere and these characters are cooped up in their cabins, wary of their neighbours and awkward with themselves.Do holidays imply peace of mind  Well. Summerwater begins with Justine, who runs early in the morning while the rest of her family are still asleep. At the start of the book shersquos considering where to go. If she runs as long as she wants to, she might have to snack later, andshe snacks the children will want to do the same. Then she remembers:ldquoShes got four protein bars tucked into her packet of sanitary towels in the suitcase, the only place no one  is likely to look, and shes not too proud to eat them in the bathroomshe has to.Its an aside but, in this book, nothing feels like an aside. This is a subtle but signicant scene in which Moss takes us into her confidence. When it comes to the workings of the secret heart, and the exchange between mind and body, this is a writer with few equals .Here we have the normalcy and lunacy of Brits on holiday. When Claire gets an hour to herself, she tries to lick the hair on her nipples. There is Milly who, in the build up to Project Simultaneous Orgasms, wonders about bread for sandwiches. Quite a feat, when you think of it, to be even considering sex in a Scottish cabin park in the rain. David, a retired doctor, knows the road by the loch as well as he knows the human body. And Moss is just as good on the body - childbirth, say - as she is on teenagers, or slugs. Though shersquos quite superb on slugs: ldquoThings shouldnrsquot be made like thathellipSpores drt up from the pages and you start to feel another presence entirely: alongside holidaymakers in repose - and distress - are short chapters told from inside an anthill, or from the point of view of a doe. Then these spectral fears dissolve into a characterrsquos annoyance with the crust on a baking tray.Not until rather late in the day does something happen to disturb this equilibrium. There hasnrsquot seemed to be any plan. But there is always a plan and, by now, Moss has done all the work she needs to do. This a writer in whose gts we trust, and she pulls off feat after feat of daring and empathy and wisdom.Justine, whose thoughts on running might be mistaken for Mossrsquo own considerations on the writing process, completes marathons in private. And Mossrsquos sentences run on too. You hear them long after you read them thought and feeling dissolving with animal grace. And, even as you delight in them, her paragraphs swing off and away - bound for the horizon  - only to be found by the side of the road, bent double, not in exhaustion but in the study of an object in close quarters, just as we do when we remember whatrsquos so revelatory about Scotland in the rain."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-five-minutes-emmerdales-lisa-riley","story":"Since ing to her role as Mandy Dingle in ITVs Emmerdale, there has been no shortage of gripping storylines for Lisa Riley to explore.The -year-old ed to the role last year and also this year has celebrated three decades of being in showbiz.She talks about whats in store for her as le has become infinitely more complicated for her character since Paularrived on the scene.Alongside Coronation Street, Emmerdale was among the productions halted as a result of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year, with filming resuming again in June.HOW DOES MANDY FEEL ABOUT PAUL \"I think the week were up to, shes scared shes scared of being hurt again, and shes scared of history repeating itself.

Around Govan Cross you see the beneficial effects of the Town Centre Action Plan, which at a cost of pound. million ndash a bankerrsquos bonus ndash made an improvement to the area, providing paving, seating, signage ndash and a restoration of the Aitken Fountain. This was an  memorial to Govanrsquos first Medical Officer of Health whose sanitary improvements massively reduced death rate in the mid-th century.As well as many other insignia the fountain sports the coat of arms of the burgh of Govan, established in , which shows ying icons but always a shiprsquos engineer and a shiprsquos carpenter. See how many such emblems you can spot on your ramble ndash and whether you can spot a single Glasgow one!There is much to here but the jewel is the refurbished former British Linen Bank by Salmon  Gillespie, an A-listed tenement from , with a delightful open-crown metal roof. Its sculptures are especially fine look at the one above the door showing two male angels driving a sailing boat by blowing their conches. Here you stand on Water Row, once a Roman road to a Clyde crossing, later the centre of the fishing and weaving community.. Moving west along the Govan Road, on your left is a statue of William Pearce, owner of the Fairfield yard and Govan MP in the s. Coming from the Chatham naval dockyard he brought war work and massive prosperity to Fairfieldrsquos, and to himself, dying worth a present day fortune of pound million. He stands beside Brechinrsquos Bar, a mock baronial building from over a century ago, which was originally Cardellrsquos Temperance Institute.Once when in there the punter next me at the bar turned unannounced and stated, ldquoSee that Noam Chomsky, we had him in here in the Year of Culture. I have never investigated the truth of this, nor of the claim of the regulars of Brechinrsquos that, at chucking out time, the Black Man, as they call the statue, takes a few steps.Opposite Brechinrsquos is located the Pearce Instutute or PI, known as the Heart of Govan. Lady Pearce gave the money for its foundation in memory of her husband and it opened in  as a cultural and social centre, with a theatre, library, billiard room and washing and cooking facilities for the majority who lacked adequate facilities. These were located in the Womenrsquos area, entered by a separate door. Times change, and females can enter the front door nowadays. The A-Listed PI was designed by Edinburgh architect Rowand Anderson in an eclectic style one half Dutch Renaissance, the other Scottish Vernacular. Atop the latter part sits a metal galleon made by the workers of Fairfields, who also contributed much free labour to helping build the. PI... Moving further west we reach the War Memorial to those killed in the First World War, behind which lies another of Govanrsquos glories, the Old Kirk . Space prohibits more than mentioning that this ndash also by Rowan Anderson ndash stands on a site that has probably been one of Christian worship for  years and a pagan one beforehand, and that it contains one of the finest collections of incised early Christian stones in Scotland, over  ndash crosses, grave slabs and the famous Govan Hogbacks as well as thereputed sargophacus of St Constantine. The connections with the Reformationand the Iona Community, add further fascination. .Between here and the next stop, Fairfields, there stands a iety of tenement buildings, some in good repair, some in less ndash and examples of the new tenements built in the last  years. The Lyceum, a former art-deco palace of a cinema is also passed and high up on it is an illustration of the original Lyceum Music Hall, destroyed in a fire. When it opened in , a packed audience heard a performance of Bizetrsquos Carmen. See Govan, see Kulcher.. On reaching ElderStreet on the right, the gates of the former Fairfield Yard, now BAE Systems, loom into view no longer do  men stream in and out of here twice a day the old tramlines which brought goods into the yards are still visible amongst the cobbles. A further walk along Govan Road brings you to the impressive front door of the former offices of the yard, now Fairfield Heritage, hosting a fine display on the history of shipbuilding housed in a building to match. The offices were designed by Keppie and Honeyman, the firm Macintosh later worked for, and though splendid inside, their finest feature is the doorway itself where amongst the usual icons of nymphs and Neptune, stand two le-size sandstone scultures of working men done by Pittendreich Macgillivray. This building is also A-Listed..Though achieving its maximum size under Pearce, the yard became a world leader under the previous owners, the Elders. Crossing the road gives a good view of the office building and also allows entrance to Elder Park, the only piece of ground in central Govan formerly not covered by tenements or industry. The park has a ied collection of sculptures relating to Govanrsquos history and a boating pond. Previously there was also a dairy farm and a small zoo!Just south of the park gates stands a statue of John Elder, leaning on the compound steam engine he invented, which gave Clyde shipbuilding a competitive edge. The statue was exectued by Boehm and is complemented by one of Isabella Elder herself further over in the park. Despite the importance of this place it was shockingly refused a Heritage Lottery grant some years ago ndash while many less worthy were not.Exiting the park is done from behind the library, with its splendid cast iron railings, and very fine frontage. The building was designed by another top Glasgow architect, J.J Burnet, and Govanites are proud of the fact they had a public library in  some years before Glasgow built their ious examples. Inside the building are busts of the Elders, and an interesting painting of pre-industrial Govan by Brotchie. This building is also A -Listed.. Moving back eastalong pedesrianised Langlands Road through an assortment of housing built to replace demolished tenements, brings us to Golspie Street, with its stunning ldquoAmsterdam-style new tenement, and then past the car park for the Govan Shopping Centre till we emerge back at Brechinrsquos and the Black Man with a very clear view of the PI. Back at Govan Cross, visit the excellent Cafe . Rest and reflect that you have only scraped the surface of central Govan, never mind Greater Govan...andyou leave unimpressed, there is no hope for you.Ian R Mitchell is the author of Walking through Glasgowrsquos Industrial Past "},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-ann-fotheringham---call-like-long-not-generation-covid","story":"That end-of-the-day chatter, a jumble of who-said-what-and-what-happened-when, has been absent from our lives since lockdown began, and I have missed it very much.It was dferent from the usual first-day-back-blether, of course ndash they had five months of catching-up to do, five months of missed chat and daftness with their friends, five months starved of all the things tweens and teens should have in their lives.They had whole new regimes to get their heads around, from handwashing and one-way systems to split timetables and lunchbreaks which seemed, for the teachers at any rate, to last about four hours.There is no doubt the last few months have been dficult for children without the structure and support of school, some young people in tough circumstances have floundered.

Physically he was also tall and handsome, totally imperturbable, probably from having faced the worst. He was someone whose best qualities most of us would strive to emulate, and fail. Branwen described him as her rock. He was.I saw him last in February in Glasgow, we went for a drink or two in the Doublet on the edge of his native Partick, then to the Shish Mahal for a curry, where we planned the trip we would never take. The original one, viewed from now, had its moments of high farce.He had told his family that he was going grape-picking in France, instead he was travelling to Paris on a single ticket and a handful of change to pick up explosives to deliver to comrades in Madrid who were planning to blow up Franco and his cabinet on a dais at Real Madridrsquos Bernabeacuteu stadium. The only French he knew was zut alors, which amused his anarchist hosts, and his Spanish was non-existent. He was to wear a bandage on his hand so his contact could recognise him and he had to be taught a phrase ndash me duele la manondash as a coded response.He set out to the south with the plastic explosive taped to his body, hitchhiking and wearing a kilt so that hersquod get lts, which led to reports in the Argentine press that a Scottish transvestite had tried to kill the Caudillo. His last lt in France broke down just short of the Spanish border and Stuart had to push the car across, sweating and hoping the plastic would hold firm, under the gaze of the Guardia Civil in their shiny, patent, three-cornered hats.The mission had been infiltrated by an informer and when Stuart handed over the package to Fernando Carballo Blanco, a carpenter who was constructing the dais and would place the charges, they were swooped on. It was August , A Hard Dayrsquos Night was top of the hit parade and Alec Douglas-Home was Prime Minster, doing economics with matches. The two were convicted on September  in a brief trial before a military tribunal, Blanco given  years.It was undoubtedly international pressure and publicity that deterred the lsquocourtrsquo from passing the customary death sentence for lsquoterrorismrsquo, which was then carried out by garrotte, the medieval process of neck-breaking in a slow mechanical strangulation by a metal collar and a bolt through the neck.Stuart was mildly roughed-up by Francorsquos secret police but he was forced to watch his co-conspirator brutally tortured. Blancorsquos father had been shot and murdered by Francorsquos forces for being a trade unionist, driving his mother mad with grief and ending in an asylum. Although Stuart was released after just less than four years after an appeal by his mother, Blanco served  years. When I was contacted by his niece last week she denied that he had been a hero. ldquoHe just wanted to free the Spanish people, she said.Franco was an unapologetic fascist and dictator who led the overthrow of the Republican government, precipitating the civil war, with the blood of many thousands, and not just combatants, on his hands. As he put it: ldquoOur regime is based on bayonets and blood, not on hypocritical elections.Stuartrsquos memory of the show trial, conducted in Spanish of course which he could not then understand, was of  army officers, heavy with medals, swords on the table in front of them, comprising what passed for a jury in a large, sticky, vaulted room. He said he felt he had been transported into the final act of some grand opera. ldquoI was  years and six weeks old, a boy from working-class Glasgow and Irsquod never been to the opera, he remembered.He learned Spanish in the Carabanchel jail and sat A-levelsand was sent money regularly from Britain but also from Spanish anarchists. The only English names they seemed to know were John, Paul, George and Ringo, so the donations turned up in these names and the authorities thought he was being funded by the Beatles.He was released in , got work as a gas fitter as Britain was converting to North Sea gas and inadvertently almost blew up a large part of Essex when he was unable to stop a massive gas leak.In , after having been arrested and spending  months in jail on remand, Stuart was acquitted of being a member of the Angry Brigade, which had carried out a series of casualty-less explosions against Edward Heathrsquos government. He claimed, and the jury believed him, that the police had planted two detonators in his car. One of the four of the convicted Stoke Newington Eight, John Barker, said later about his own experience, ldquoThe police fitted-up a guilty man.Two years later Stuart and I holidayed in a remote cottage up a narrow, pebbled track outside Oban, where we walked, talked and sank a few malts in the evening round a roaring fire. At the same time a Francoist banker had been kidnapped by an anarchist group and a ransom paid. When Stuart ed to London he was warned by a friendly Special Branch officer that he wasnrsquot safe and should get out of town, which he did with his we Brenda, first to Yorkshire and then the remote Orkney island of Sanday, to a house called Over the Water.Then, the island might have been some prototype of an anarchist society, in that it was peacefully,bibulously, self-governing, with only an occasional police presence coming in by ferry from the mainland, the officersrsquo travel well telegraphed. Irsquom not sure anyone there bothered with car insurance. On one occasion a man was arrested for alleged drunk driving, the local doctor refused to test him and by the time the coppers had somehow managed to hire a boat and take him to the main island he was sober.I visited him and Brenda often, and many an evening was spent in the Kettletoft Hotel bar, often with instruments and a sing-song going, irregardless of conventional closing time, until the last patron exited. On one occasion two bold officers turned up and insisted that the bar was cleared at pm, to the considerable ire and disgruntlement of those of us who considered the evening was just beginning.There was a party to go to and Stuart and some others light-heartedly berated the two policemen now sitting in a car outside with the windows down. While he and they kept the officers occupied someone crept round the back of the car and let the tyres down.We sped off waving.Stuart and Brenda spent seven years on Sanday, Branwen was born there, and from the island he launched his publishing house the Cienfuegos Press , a major publisher of anarchist literature, and a radical newspaper, the Free-Winged Eagle. The local minister of course denounced him as the ldquoanti-Christ.Stuart Christie was born in Partick to a hairdresser and a hard-drinking trawlerman, Albert. He was named Stuart after Bonnie Prince Charlie, ldquothe only man in history to be called after three separate sheepdogs, according to fellow Partiquois Billy Connolly. When he was six his parents went to friends for a drink, his dad was given a glass of sherry which he looked at in disgust, poured down the sink and walked out the door without saying a word. ldquoThe joke was that he had gone for a packet of fags, but thatrsquos the last time we saw him until he turned up  years later, Christie recalls.By then Stuart had a half-sister, Olivia. But the formative influence on him had been his granny Agnes McCulloch Davis, with whom he did most of his growing up on Arran and in Glasgow. He described her as the moral barometer in his le, ldquoand she provided the star I followed. She kept me on the straight and narrow. Well, with a few well-publicised detours!His partial autobiography, a compilation of three self-published volumes, was appropriately called Granny Made Me An Anarchist, in which many of the truths are told. Itrsquos a rollicking account peppered with cultural and political reference points, from the Jeely Piece Song, to Leslie Howard, Buntildeuel and Just William. Itrsquos also extremely funny.He also wrote a trilogy of novels iexclPistoleros! The Chronicles of Farquar McHarg, about a fictional Scottish anarchist born in  who became involved in the Spanish civil war, which weaves in actual happenings and some of the principal villains of the time. Stuart also managed to pack in a degree in history and politics along the way.Brenda Christie died in June last year, nursed by her husband and earlier this year Stuart moved to Colchester to be near daughter Branwen and her girls, his granddaughters Merri and Mo, for too short a time. He had previously fought cancer, this time it was lung cancer which spread to the bone. His suffering was mercully short.Irsquove been with him when hersquos been introduced to people and occasionally the response would be, ldquoNot that Stuart Christie !

When it was rising, interest rates were increased to discourage borrowing and encourage saving thereby reducing the money supply in the system to buy goods and services. The result was prices stabilised and any increases were modest.The converse of that scenario is a reduction in interest rates to encourage spending and investment, which is where we are today. The theory is profit and wealth will be generated to preserve jobs, create new ones through investment and pay down the exceptionally high level of debt resulting from the Covid- epidemic. However, it does not appear to be working.Although base rate is at an all-time low of .%, Bank of England statistics indicate that depositorsrsquo balances are at a record high.

The Prince of Darkness is not renowned for making concessions. Irsquom sure both Mr Gove and Mr Galloway will forgive meI suggest that, for some, the identity of Auld Nick in this esoteric coupling may be subject to perpetual speculation.The Twitter alliance of these seemingly irreconcilable political foes has been born of mounting Unionist fears over the break up of the United Kingdom. Two more opinion polls this week continued an extended recent trend in favour of independence with one indicating an all-time high of % for Yes.Mr Gove, unofficial minister for the Union Jack in Boris Johnsonrsquos hard-right cabinet, has thus been seeking cross-party allies for what is likely to be Britainrsquos last imperial battle. According to the London Times, he has already held discussions with Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodaleand Danny Alexander, the former Liberal-Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury.When Mr Galloway, leader of the Workers Party of Great Britain, suggested this week that the ldquo, Scots living where in the UK must have a vote in the second referendum on independence Mr Gove replied ldquointeresting question. Mr Galloway at least possesses that rare commodity in British politics: principles.He might well have enjoyed a stellar career near the top of British politics were it not for his habit of reminding assorted Labour leaders how to spell S-O-C-I-A-L-I-S-T. Presumably, hersquoll defend his present dalliance with Mr Gove, a man who once apologised for participating in a strike, on the grounds that nationalism in whatever form is the enemy of international socialism. Butyour beliefs drive you into a camp led by one who has built his career abjuring everything you hold to be dear then perhaps you might ask yourself what it was you thought you were fighting for all this time.Mr Goversquos fireside chats with the laird of Glencorrosdaleare much easier to understand. Lord McConnell and his brother Labour barons were chiefly responsible for reducing Labour in Scotland to its current status of Holder of the Jaikets. In this wretched period the party has come to be defined not by its commitment to the communities that once nurtured it but by its alliance with the Conservative and Unionist Party.Irsquom also intrigued by Mr Gallowayrsquos late attempt to gerrymander the boundaries for a future referendum. In the six years since the last independence referendum Unionists have cited the ldquopeople of Scotland in their claims of a once-in-a-generation event. Irsquom interested to know by what geographical contortion an address in Dorset can now be considered to be ldquoof Scotland.Letrsquos leave aside for the moment concerns about being over-optimistic at the shiny Yes numbers. As Irsquove suggested previously, we are living in abnormal times when the usual scrutiny of a partyrsquos domestic policy record has been suspended. And be in no doubt, when the second independence referendum does begin the British state will deploy every artice and lever at its disposal to maintain Westminster rule.Itrsquos now apparent, though, that the Yes cause is building momentum over a prolonged period of time. It would be tempting to ascribe this merely to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquopresentationalrsquo skills and Boris Johnsonrsquos lack of them. Certainly, it would be foolish not to acknowledge that the First Ministerrsquos leadership has been a factor in the recent numbers for independence. If you can trust the nationrsquos leader when a pandemic threatens your existence then trusting her when she makes the economic and cultural cause for independence would not seem to be the massive leap it was in .There is something  at play here. Itrsquos become clear that from the lived experience of coronavirus has sprung a desire for profound and lasting societal change at many levels. One of the strongest suits of Better Together in  was the perception of stability. Many who had seriously considered voting for independence ultimately recoiled from taking a step into the unknown and a future uncertain. But when our immediate andlong-term future is wreathed in uncertainty the perceived risks of self-determination recede a little.During the five months of lockdown many have found that those institutions they once looked to for security and stability have let them down or revealed to have been a mirage. They have seen officials at the top of the Westminster Government recklessly disregard lockdown restrictions with impunity and disregard for the safety of the nation. They have come to discover that being locked out of Britainrsquos affluence means you are three times likelier to die of Covid- than those you entrusted with your health and wellbeing.From the outset of this pandemic they have witnessed the worst excesses of the capitalist system that gives oxygen to the forces now telling them to preserve the Union at any cost. They now know that those who always tell them ldquowe are all in it together wasted no time in saying ldquoyoursquore on your own when super-rich shareholders demanded redundancies to protect their idends. At the first hint of trouble after years of massive profits the lowest-paid workers were first to be thrown overboard. And they know too that lsquoemergency fundingrsquo means large quantities of cash being handed to the families and friends of UK ministers for sub-standard protective equipment and no questions asked.Britain during coronavirus has been exposed as a vicious little gangster state and this is what George Galloway and Lord McConnell are being duped into defending.

Any over-running will not go down well with television networks and viewers waiting for their shows to start.What a change it will be for a candidate who is at his happiest when he is speaking to his base in some vast auditorium. Gone will be the glory days of  when packed rallies cheered his every word and a penned press could be held up for the crowdrsquos ridicule. How much atmosphere can even he generate before an audience of  people  His team need to avoid at all costs repeating the flop that was the Tulsa rally, when a paltry , people turned up and the atmosphere fell flat.Come the fireworks display over the White House lawn on Thursday certain things should be clearer. As with the Democrats, the partyrsquos general direction of travel will be apparent. The Democrats went for the centre ground, going heavy on the personal ndash Mr Bidenrsquos steadiness, decency, inclusiveness ndash and light on policy. It was the most positive campaign launch since Barack Obamarsquos  run.It would be the mother and father of all convention surprisesthe Republicans followed suit. Mr Trump has been trying out ious lines for size, accusing Mr Biden and his Veep nominee Kamala Harris of being prisoners of the left. A heavy emphasis on law and order and protecting the suburbs is expected. But how personal can he be in attacking his opponents  This is not  when he questioned the integrity of Hillary Clinton, and encouraged his supporters to do the same. Voters may accept that from a candidate, but not a President.Perhaps the best the Republicans can expect from their unconventional convention is to get through it without any major gaffes. They can then start campaigning proper where it matters, on the ground. With most voters not turning their attention to the election until a couple of weeks before polling day, the conventions had already lost much of their impact. It still matters to get it right, though.Over to you, producer-in-chief Trump.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The polls in  showing Yes at over  per cent. The ldquosurge in SNP membership. The marches. All of them have been declared as signs that the momentum is with Yes and the same inevitably happened this week with the polls showing Yes on % and %. Forgive meI donrsquot get overly excited.But we shouldnrsquot be unduly cynical either. In private, senior figures in the SNP say the tipping point they really need is % and one of the first steps towards achieving % is saying you have momentum, whether itrsquos true or not. Itrsquos the faith factor that can attract believers which is why Nicola Sturgeon keeps doing it and was doing it again this week. The new polls, she said, showed that ldquothe momentum is very clearly with us.:Veteran SNP MSP calls for complete re-write of independence caseThe second step in the process, the other factor you need to reach %, is capitalising on the momentum you actually have, but thatrsquos a tricky one for the SNP because itrsquos not clear whatrsquos causing the recent rise in support. It could be Brexit, but then again the SNPrsquos big hope in  was that the result of the EU referendum would lead to a surge for them but it pretty much failed to materialise. Indeed, the First Ministerrsquos attempts to link Brexit with a second independence referendum led to the SNP suffering big losses at the General Election in .Alternatively, the latest encouraging polls for the SNP could be down to coronavirus and the fact that people seem pleased with the SNPrsquos handling of it. Ms Sturgeon says herself she believes this to be a factor ndash ldquoshow not tell she calls it ndash but itrsquos a hard trend to capitalise on isnrsquot it  If it was Brexit fuelling support for Yes, the SNP could keep on capitalising on itthe economy suffers. Butitrsquos coronavirus thatrsquos boosting support, the crisis will eventually fade and it may take some of the new support with it.Stage three on the road to % ndash building momentum beyond your core groups ndash is also quite hard to work out. Itrsquos clear that most of the sht from No to Yes has happened among Labour voters the firmest support for Yes is also still clustered around cities and the more deprived parts of those cities. But to get independence to the -plus zone that devolution reached  years ago, you need the momentum to get beyond those hard cores.Ms Sturgeon acknowledged this herself in  when she said that what really built the momentum for devolution in the s was the involvement of people beyond party politics. ldquoThe churches, trade unions, writers, artists, business people, she said, ldquothey all had their say and they were driving forces in building the momentum that led Labour to promise a referendum and the people of Scotland to vote for a Parliament with tax ying powers. If the SNP is to get % for independence, it needs the same kind of trend.But itrsquos stage four that could really take the Yes side over the line because itrsquos often the point where the process is almost impossible to reverse. Behaviourists call it ldquosocial herding and what it means is that when a politician or cause appears to be popular, people will gravitate towards it because itrsquos popular therersquos also a certain part of the electorate that will want to be on the winning side. Again, you saw some of that in the s with devolution it got to the point whereyou didnrsquot support a Scottish Parliament, you were a bit of a freak and itrsquos not always easy to stick to a beliefyou think everyone  thinks dferently. Itrsquos social herding that will take us over the line to  plus.Which leaves the question of where Scotland actually is in the four-stage process and I think the answer to that is not as far as some in the SNP think. Therersquos no denying the upward trend for Yes, and therersquos probably been a sht because of coronavirus, but we will have to wait to seethe SNP really is in stage two and can capitalise on whatrsquos happening.As for stage three ndash reaching out beyond the hard core ndash again therersquos not much evidence yet of support changing except in the soft middle which wersquove known for a while now is prone to shting back and forth. Itrsquos also worth remembering political scientist John Curticersquos point that support for Yes may come down again under the sustained attack there will be on independence in the event of a second referendum. In other words, momentum can go down as well as up.:SNP call for Russia to respect Ukraines independenceAnd therersquos another factor which may be more important than momentum anyway. As Irsquove already pointed out, who you are and where you live was a massive factor in how you voted on independence: well-off areas voted No, poorer areas voted Yes. But demographics change and, in the end, this could be whatrsquos really critical for the independence case.First, coronavirus and Brexit will make a lot of us poorer and nationalism does well in economies that are struggling ndash so the harder le gets for people, the more likely they are to be tempted by Yes. But secondly, support for independence is higher among under-s than it is among older people and the laws of demographics are clear on that one: the second group is going to get smaller. Political views can change as you age of course, but the demographic destiny looks undeniable.The question of momentum is much less certain. I know Nicola Sturgeon says she has it, but she said the same thing in  and  and look what happened then. But there are signs of change and as soon as therersquos an indication that the coronavirus effect is sticking or that support for independence is reaching beyond the hard core, thatrsquos when the momentum could really get going. Thatrsquos when % could become an achievable goal. Thatrsquos when independence will become unstoppable.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The online programme sees researchers and scientists explore a range of topics including space technology, mental health, cancer research, video games, language and articial intelligence.Dundee University researcher Dr Senga Robertson-Albertynrsquos talk will look at how improving food quality and availability could lie beneath the soil, in plants roots and their unique biome systems.ldquoMicrobes wonrsquot save the world one microbe at a time, this isnrsquot a magic bullet. But it does have global implications, said Dr Robertson-Albertyn, who is working on how plant microbiomes in spinach and tomatoes could be tailored to improve quality, productivity, safety and sustainability.ldquoBy tweaking the plantrsquos microbiome, we could help it be more successful as a crop, or not require as much chemical input.ldquoIt could lead to improved yields using microbes to help plants take up nutrients more effectively, and improve the quality of food.Plants have their own microbiome that has evolved over millions of years. However, breeding to create larger yields or boost the size of fruit or grains, along with the use of fertilisers and pesticides have left an impact on how plants recruit important bacteria and affected the balance of microbes in the soil in which theyrsquore grown.Itrsquos hoped that by unravelling the way plants recruit microbes and introducing ways to encourage a more effective uptake of the lsquohealthyrsquo bacteria, plants can go on to thrive without the need for potentially damaging chemicals.ldquoWe have lost a lot of genetic ersity that impacts on what they recruit bacterially, added Dr Robertson-Albertyn. ldquoWe want to readjust it by adding microbes to plant when put in the ground to help them enrich what they were.She added the technology could be particularly useful in areas where farmers do not have access to fertiliser or pesticides which could increase their yield, or where soil conditions are particularly poor or overworked.ldquoThe importance of microbes in plants is becoming more apparent, particularly in light of work on the human gut, she added. ldquoThere are many people now researching plant microbiomes and how we can tweak the microbiome to help the plant be more successful or not require as much chemical input.While bacteria inoculant treatments are available which can be added to plantsrsquo soil, often by the time they get to the plants they donrsquot work because they have to compete with hundreds of thousands of other bacteria present in the soil.ldquoYou canrsquot just throw bacteria at a plant and expect them to accept it, she added.ldquoWhen you look at adding microbes around the roots of plant, itrsquos not that you are trying to change or improve the relationship between plants and microbes that has evolved over millions of years, she added.ldquoItrsquos trying to repair some of the changes through breeding and plant management that have altered the way plants are reacting to microbes, and repairing plants to get them back to how they used to be.ldquoIt is a bit like going back to the future.Can We Get to the Root of Things  on August , is part of the RSE Curious programme. https:www.rse-curious"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-ronald-mcdonald-house-receives-donations-book-club-saw-online-members-soar-lockdown","story":"However, now the Edinburgh-based Rare Birds Book Club is giving something back and has donated a collection of books to a charity which supports families with free home away from home accommodation to families while their child is in hospital.The monthly book delivery and digital book club sends over  books to Ronald McDonald House in Glasgow.During the lockdown period, Rare Birds Book Club reported a  per cent growth, taking the subscription service and digital book club from , subscribers per month to more than ,.Read more:Coronavirus has been a signicant factor in everyones lives and the memorial garden would recognise that, says leading professorWanting to show its appreciation for customersrsquo ongoing support during such unprecedented times - times which saw many small businesses collapse ndash founder Rachel Wood decided to give back to a community that had a connection with Rare Birds.

Despite some bold action, last week the Scottish Government published their second annual progress report revealing that one in four children are still trapped in poverty.We all know that this is unacceptable. We know that this can change because we have done it before. But to achieve real change in the circumstances we now face will require a signicant increase in the scale and impact of investment across three main areas ndash employment, social security, and housing.The Scottish Government is right to highlight that independent forecasts, published in , predicted that child poverty rates would increase by , largely in response to UK Government welfare reforms. While child poverty rates may have stabilised before the pandemic, we expect an economic storm to create greater risks. Those of us restless for no child to grow up in poverty must not lose our resolve.The roll back of UK Government furlough and self-employment support schemes will see further income shocks and stronger headwinds for families in the Autumn. We are expecting to see unemployment rise and rising debt levels as families grapple with the gap between falling incomes and additional costs, with many risking falling behind with rents and mortgages.At the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, we are deeply concerned at the degree of financial strain and uncertainty felt by many families. Currently, seven in  families with children on low incomes are having to cut back on essentials. Families who were already struggling to keep their heads above water are now feeling the full force of the economic storm caused by Covid-.It is imperative that we put in place a stronger leline for these families now or we risk making the challenge of tackling child poverty in Scotland much harder in the future.Many positive steps are already being taken ndash but together their impact does not rise to the scale of the challenge we face nor provide enough targeted support for families.Our first priority must be to avoid rising unemployment leading to a surge in poverty. Government and employers need to work in partnership to urgently create new good jobs and equip Scots with the skills they need to access them.While the UK Governmentrsquos Kickstart scheme will play a key role in guaranteeing young people work for at least twelve months, itrsquos vital that this support is extended to over-s and other groups who already faced additional barriers in the jobs market before the recession.Extra resources being committed to the Parental Employment Support Fund over the next year offer potentially crucial support to help parents find the best combination of hours, earnings, and childcare to improve their prospects. To be effective, we need to see better alignment between local economic development strategies and this investment ndash boosting the supply of, and access to, good quality, flexible jobs with opportunities to progress.Sadly, we know that we are living through one of the deepest economic downturns on record and job losses are inevitable. Therefore, strengthening our social security system so that it protects people from being pulled into poverty and debt will be essential.We welcome the Cabinet Secretary Aileen Campbellrsquos commitment to prioritise the Scottish Child Payment and begin payments to low-income families with children under six by the end of February. However, as local lockdowns and ongoing social restrictions are likely to remain in place for some time, plans must be implemented to ensure that enough support reaches those who are struggling now.Many across Scotland face uncertainty about whether they will be able to access a decent home or keep the one they currently have. It is right that the Scottish Government has indicated it will act to avoid a potential Autumn spike in evictions, by extending legal protections until the end of next March.This is a vital first step, but also needs to be complemented by genuinely affordable rent repayment plans that balance the needs of tenants and landlords. Where this cannot be achieved, the Government should be ready to step in.All that said, there is no route to achieving the child poverty targets without many more families being able to access good quality, social housing.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

The , others include those unable to work on site or remotely, and staff on annual leave, sick leave or special leave. Most - nearly , - of these were in the Department for Communities.The Department of Finance had a £m IT budget last year.It spent an additional £m on equipping staff for home working.A spokesperson said over , laptops were purchased, along with software to support remote working including video conferencing.Mr Allister said: The number of civil servants working from home is phenomenal. I would questionit still needs to be at the level it is.With working from home on that scale, there will be costs for equipment.The point of increasing concern is the lack of urgency in getting civil servants back to the office.Mr Allister has submitted Assembly questions around civil servants# productivity while working from home.He added: In a workforce of that size, there may be some who are less eager to pull their weight outside the office.Earlier this month it emerged that Economy Minister Diane Dodds had written to the head of the Civil Service David Sterling calling for staff toto offices to boost town and city centre economies.Mrs Dodds said one of the greatest drivers of footfall in Belfast city centre would beNorthern Ireland Civil Service staff are back at work.Alison Millar, general secretary of the Nipsa trade union, said that, where possible, civil servants should work from home. She said: Not all civil servants had the ITin the initial few weeks however, over a relatively short period of time thousands of civil servants were provided with the appropriate IT to allow them to work from home.In the main the vast majority are working effectively from home using their employer-provided IT. It is not ideal. However, from a health and safety perspective Nipsa would fully support home-working given the rise in the R number, and the fact that the Executive and PHA guidance states that where you can work from home, you should continue to work from home. Home is the safest place to be at the moment.The Department of Finance said: The number of staff who can safely work within our offices has been considerably reduced to comply with social distancing, which has proven to be the most effective means of preventing the spread of the virus. Throughout this crisis, our staff have worked remotely to ensure the provision of vital services and support to a wide range of people, including those members of society and businesses impacted by Covid-. Over , laptops were purchased and associated software to support remote working including video conferencing and increased network capacity to ensure the continuation of public services including payment of benefits and other vital government services throughout the duration of the crisis. This unprecedented sht to remote working in the NICS has had the effect of enabling the workforce to be more flexible, working remotely and delivering new ways of working that has the potential in the longer term to deliver savings on office accommodation and improve productivity.

It says that actual losses to the sector here stand at £.m for the last six months alone but it warns that the figure is likely to reach double that by the end of the yearA statement says: To compound matters further, many arts organisations which rely heavily on income generated through box office, a model decimated by social distancing, are now facing a socially distanced Christmas season ahead, normally one of the most profitable times of year for the arts.The hugely popular Grand Opera House pantomime, which had been due to star May McFettridge in Goldilocks and the Three Bears, has been postponed for a year after Covid- delayed work on a massive refurbishment programme.Officials at the Millennium Forum in Derry Londonderry have also postponed their panto, Sleeping Beauty, for  months.The ACNI says it has been working closely with the Department for Communities to support arts organisation, inidual artists and freelances whose work in the creative sector has been decimated.The council says it and the Department have put together a series of emergency funding initiatives.But the ACNI warned: Short term measures now will not save the arts and entertainment infrastructure nor many of those who work within it, from artists to lighting technicians, drivers to musicians. Their work has completely disappeared and the future is uncertain.It is crucial that the arts and creative sectors are supported and sustained with further investment now and over the coming years in order to plan and deliver arts programming - programming and activities that are so important to our night time economy, to cultural tourism and to the health and wellbeing of the many iniduals most in need in our communities.The ACNI says that assistance for the arts has included: l Fty per cent of the £.m in annual core grants being paid up front to support  key arts organisations in April .l Two hundred and twenty four funding awards being made to inidual artists, totalling £,, in May June  through the Artists Emergency Programme .l The opening of the Iniduals Emergency Resilience Programmein July, worth £.m from the Department for Communities and from Future Screens NI, offering grants to iniduals working in the creative sector. l One hundred and fty funding awards being made to arts organisations, totalling £.m, through the Organisations Emergency Programme , with a second round of the programme opening soon.l The imminent opening of a capital funding programme to help arts organisations prepare for a safe reopening of venues and performance spaces.The ACNI has already said it is continuing to press government for parity of esteem in public investment in the arts here, to close the gap on spending per head of the population in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic.Last week Game of Thrones and Derry Girls star Ian McElhinney called for more government and ACNI backing for struggling actors and technicians and said he hoped funds would be directed at professionals in the industry rather than being erted to community projects.

He said he would keep the matter under review. The EA said there had been a much more positive financial outturn for the most recent financial year, ending in April.Details of the overspend emerged in a recent report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office, which examined the EA#s   accounts. The EA#s budget is approved by the Department of Educationand the Department for the Economy .Mr Donnelly states: DE provided a budget for education services of £,m for  . The EA#s actual spend on education services in the period was £,.m, resulting in an overspend of £.m. There were underspends on student and further education support services funded by DfE and on youth services funded by DE. This meant the overall overspend by the EA was £.m in  .The EA said extra was spent on Special Educational Needs , rates , transport , increases in schools# deficits , and headquarter costs . The body had also exceeded its budget by £.m in   and by £.m in  .In his report, Mr Donnelly writes: The EA advised me that the issues which led to overspends in education services since   are still prevalent today, and are reflective of the signicant financial pressures facing the education sector, with pay and price increases being unfunded for the past five years, combined with growing service pressures across the educational sector. He adds: On this basis, EA further advised the budget for   did not take into account pay and price inflationary pressures and did not fully meet pressures from increased demand. EA also highlighted that the deficit position was mitigated to some degree by savings of £m achieved in the period, bringing the total savings delivered since   to £.m. EA told me that given the scale of the challenges facing the education sector, the EA is focused on developing a longer term strategic recovery plan to address the EA#s and schools# financial stability and sustainability. This is a signicant undertaking that will fundamentally shape the scale and scope of service delivery to schools, children and young people for a generation and it is anticipated that it will take a period of three to five years to ensure that the appropriate arrangements can be fully considered, evidenced, consulted upon and implemented.In October  the Audit Office reported on the financial health of schools, which noted the number of schools operating in deficit. In his latest report, Mr Donnelly added: It is concerning that the number of schools which are in deficit continues to increase, with the EA reporting that the number increased from  in  to  in   . These figures exclude voluntary grammars and grant maintained integrated schools.The EA developed a new approach towards schools# financial planning in  . This included undertaking financial health checks of schools and identying ways to reduce spending. However, Mr Donnelly said the benefits of this work may not be evident for another year or more. He added: Whilst I acknowledge the financial pressures education funding is under, it is important that the EA lives within its budget. An EA spokesperson said: The education sector continues to face a range of financial pressures and we have been working closely with the Department of Education to manage these pressures. During the   financial year, the Minister for Education secured additional funding of over £m and we delivered further cost savings in excess of £m.

The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park.

German bombers swarmed the skies. Belfast bore the brunt of a -strong Luftwaffe squadron, with  dead and , injured as a result. Seventy miles up the road, Derry was hit only once. It was not the Germans’ planned target. Thirteen lives were lost when a German bomb overshot its proposed target and hit Messines Park in Shantallow, home to a colony of ex-servicemen who had served in the Great War. Messines Park was named after the  Battle of Messines, in which the thDivision and thDivision had fought side by side. The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. googletag.cmd.push Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for pound,-- - pound, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around pound per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would opened in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would opened in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

Education Minister Peter Weir yesterday announced a u-turn on results, with all pupils now to be given the higher of the grades submitted by their centre or the grade calculated by CCEA Over a third of all AS and A grades given to students by teachers had been originally downgraded by CCEAs standardisation system last week in a move which drew critcisim from schools, parents and pupils. One County Derry school saw  percent of its results downgraded. Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.” Related: COMMENT: Belated U-turn should have come last week  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose.

Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

Yet for all the hoopla underpinning Sinn Fein’s our-day-will-come project their so-called ‘inevitable’ unity cannot be taken for granted. Likewise, Micheál Martin’s ‘beefed-up’ Shared Island Unit may have irked unionism a couple of weeks ago, but even he would admit that there is nothing inevitable about a united Ireland. But regular readers will know that I’m a be-ready-for-all-outcomes-and-possibilities kind of guy. I’ve said many, many times that I’m an unambiguous, unapologetic unionist and I can conceive of no circumstance in which I would swap my citizenship of the United Kingdom for citizenship of a united Ireland. That said, I’m not afraid of a debate on the subject and I have no objection to any party which wants to make the case for unity by entirely democratic means. I’m aware there are unionists who believe taking part in the debate risks conveying the impression you think unity has become a serious possibility. Yet in not taking part – or failing to even make your own case from a separate  – there’s also the risk of allowing your political opponents to gain traction. The problem, as we now know, is that once that happens it becomes very dficult to catch-up with your own counter-message and narrative, let alone gain an edge and take the lead in terms of input and impact. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Peter Robinson and Mike Nesbitt at the announcement of the subsequently short-lived Unionist Forum in January I noted in the column a couple of weeks ago that John Hume had more specic, lasting influence on successive UK governments than had any unionist equivalent. That’s because he took his case – at a time when people were barely even listening to local nationalism, because the electoral gap between unionism and non-unionism was so wide – to anyone and everyone who would open a door and incline an ear in London, Dublin, Washington or Brussels . That’s why so much of what used to be mocked by unionists as ‘Hume-speak’ found its way into government policy and subsequent political initiatives.With Northern Ireland’s centenary just around the cornerthere are a number of issues for unionists to consider. A centenary celebration will, by its very nature, focus attention on the past but it also involves surveying the presentand preparing for the future.In terms of the challenges unionists face, here are a number off the top of my head. The clash between the competing nationalisms across the United Kingdom the surge, influence and interests of a rebooted English nationalismthe rise of Scottish nationalism and Sinn Fein the combined impact of finally leaving the EU without a deal and the massive economic hit the UK has already taken from the pandemic the closing electoral gap between unionism and nationalism in Northern Ireland the rise of what can best be described as the ‘other’ demographic in Northern Ireland and how it can be kept within the pro-UK camp the outcome of an independence referendum in Scotlandand, of course, the looming shadow of a border poll .In September , at a dinner celebrating the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, Peter Robinson spoke about creating a Council for the Union to prepare for the  celebrations. Now, unless it is meeting and preparing and planning well below the radar I’m not aware of anything on the scale of which he was talking. And while it’s true that he and Mike Nesbitt jointly convened a Unionist Forum in January it is also true that it collapsed within a few months – with quite a few cross words.At this point I have no ideawhat Boris Johnson imagines will emerge from his Forum and Panel discussions. I don’t knowhe has given them a steer or an outline from which to work, orhe just intends to let them do their own thing as long as they provide him with an opportunity to do one of his rambling, hand-me-down Churchillian addresses to the nation. My fear – and it isn’t just a passing one, by the way – is that his references to Northern Ireland and ‘Ulster’ unionism will be so ambiguous and let’s-not-offend-anyone-at-all as to be utterly meaningless.In  Brian Faulkner fronted a three-day debate in the NI Parliament to mark the first half-centenary. In the absence of a unionist majority in the Assembly I’m not sure Arlene Foster would even consider such a debate. There’s no unionist majority in Belfast City Council, either so no cheerleading for the Union there. Who knows what Covid- restrictions might still be imposed upon us in the first six months of , orpublic celebrations of the Unionwill even be possible.Yet whatever happens it strikes me as essential that a united, coherent, pro-Union, pro-UKmessage is heard from unionism within Northern Ireland. Yes, we have serious challengesand issues from which we would be extraordinarily stupid to shy away but our identity, citizenship, political beliefs and sense of belonging to a pan-UK family is worth commemorating and celebrating.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He said that any recommendations would “need to go to the executive at the appropriate time for them to make a decision”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Now, however, western world politicians often defer big decisions to committees or experts, rather than make hard choices themselves.Even the supposedly radical Tory government in London, whichwants to shake up how the UK is governed, has hidden its pandemic decision making behind scientists.The A Level-GCSE fiasco is rooted in the cowardice that led to UK schools being shut earlier than the government wanted, and staying closed for longer.Even now teaching unions and other voices are trying to stop a fullto school next month, when in fact there should have been a push to get pupils back in the weeks after Easter– or at least exam years.There are four broad reasons why ato anything like the general lockdown we experienced after March  is not plausible.• The first is that the nation can’t afford to sustain the furlough schemeIt has already pushed debt to perilous levels. If furlough was extended into next year, there would need to be massive tax increases and spending cuts, including public sector pay cuts .NI politicians have no stomach for such toughness. Even in a financial crisis, Stormont seems only ever inclined to grant pay rises, including a huge recent teacher rise. Councils abused furlough by topping up Treasury funding of % of salaries with ratepayer cash to ensure no staff had any pay reduction.• The second reason lockdown is not feasible is the public mood. The UK government has been fairly criticised for the many things it did wrong over Covid, but few people cite thingsit got right. Its behavioural experts saidlockdown came in too early people would get fed up after a while, and begin to break it. That began to happen after two months. In June there were growing reports of young people socialising in groups .As well as fatigue with restrictions, people began to develop an instinctive sense of the risk of Covid, similar to how we assess car travel .• The third reason lockdown is not feasible is that infection levels do not justy such a massive response.Even the level cited by Dr McBride –  per , cases – is low according to some experts. Prof Carl Heneghan of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said epidemic level is five times higher .He said people were failing to understand, and balance, risks.Mr Swann and Dr McBride have accepted such balance over schooling .But such balancing equations should be applied more widely .Few politicians are candid that the Covid risk cannot be cut to zero.Sweden’s former state epidemiologist Prof Johan Giesecke said from the outset that it was not possible to halt Covid’s spread. Recent upsurges in case even in nations that were seen as models of control, such as Germany and South Korea, have vindicated that prediction. • The fourth reason another lockdown is not feasible is specic to NI: Bobby Storey’s funeral shattered Stormont’s authority. There was a cross-party determination to protect Sinn Fein . This meant the first and deputy first ministers cannot preside over press briefings that might reveal suspension of liberty.Instead, the political parties erted attention from the calculating nature of SF leaders’ social distancing breach on June  in westBelfast by backing probes into important but secondary matters such as PSNI and Belfast council handling of the funeral. But in the absence of sanction against hypocritical leaders who set the rules, the damage is irreparable. A population that for months largely obeyed lockdown, including missing funerals of loved ones, watched as republicans were allowed to do as they pleased.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Autumn in Northern Ireland always seems to arrive in late August——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It says: “The current global pandemic means that there are no risk-free options, but it is important that parents and teachers understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children.ChildrenWe are confident that multiple sources of evidence show that a lack of schooling increases inequalities, reduces the le chances of children and can exacerbate physical and mental health issues. School improves health, learning, socialisation and opportunities throughout the le course including employment. It has not been possible to reduce societal inequalities through the provision of home-based education alone. School attendance is very important for children and young people.We are confident in the extensive evidence that there is an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from COVID-. The infection fatality ratefor those aged  to  is estimated at  per million, lower than for most seasonal flu infections. Every death of a child is a tragedy but COVID- deaths in children and teenagers are fortunately extremely rare and almost all deaths are in children with signicant pre-existing health conditions.We are confident that there is clear evidence of a very low rate of severe disease in children of primary and secondary school ages compared to adults, eventhey catch COVID-. The percentage of symptomatic cases requiring hospitalisation is estimated to be .% for children aged  to  and .% among those aged  to , compared to a hospitalisation rate of over % in the UK for the general population. Most of these children make a rapid recovery.We are confident that there is clear evidence from many studies that the great majority of children and teenagers who catch COVID- have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.There is reasonable, but not yet conclusive, evidence that primary school age children have a signicantly lower rate of infection than adults .Evidence that older children and teenagers are at lower risk of catching COVID- is mixed. They are either less likely to catch COVID- than adults or have the same risk as adults.Transmission of COVID- to children in schools does occur. On current evidence it is probably not a common route of transmission. It may be lower in primary age children than secondary age children.Control measures such as hand and surface hygiene, cohorting to reduce number of daily contacts, and directional controls to reduce face-to-face contact remain key elements of maintaining COVID- secure school environments and minimising risk.Children and young people who were previously shielding were identied on a precautionary basis at a stage when we had less data on the effects of COVID- in children than we do now. Based on our better understanding of COVID- the great majority have now been advised they do not need to do so again, and that they shouldto school. A small number of children under paediatric carehave been or will be given inidual advice about any ongoing need to avoid infection.Our overall consensus is that, compared to adults, children may have a lower risk of catching COVID- , definitely have a much lower rate of hospitalisation and severe disease, and an exceptionally low risk of dying from COVID-. Very few,any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from COVID- due solely to attending school. This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school.Teachers, other school staff and parentsData from the UKsuggest teachers are not at increased risk of dying from COVID- compared to the general working-age population. ONS data identies teaching as a lower risk profession . International data support this.Transmission of COVID- to staff members in school does occur, and data from UK and international studies suggest it may largely be staff to staffrather than pupil to staff. This reinforces the need to maintain social distancing and good infection control inside and outside classroom settings, particularly between staff members and between older children and adults.If teachers, other school staff, parents or wider family catch COVID- their risks of severe illness are similar to those of other adults of the same age, ethnicity and health status. Younger adults have a much lower risk of severe COVID- than older adults. The greatest risk is to those over  years old.Current international evidence suggests transmission of COVID- from children of school age to parents or other adult family members is relatively rare compared to transmission from adults, but this evidence is weak. Teenagers may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children.Children and young people should be engaged in the process of establishing COVID- secure measures as key participants and promoters of safe communities to help protect their wider families, teachers and other school staff and other social networks. This will help reduce the risk of school outbreaks.Impact of opening schools on wider transmission Because schools connect households it is likely opening schools will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely and therefore increase R. We have confidence in the current evidence that schools are much less important in the transmission of COVID- than for influenza or some other respiratory infections. Other work and social environments also increase risk and are likely to be more important for transmission of COVID-.The international real-world evidence suggests that reopening of schools has usually not been followed by a surge of COVID- in a timescale that implies schools are the principal reason for the surge. There has, however, not been sufficient time to say this with confidence.On the other hand, a local or national surge in transmission in the community may lead to an increased risk of school outbreaks occurring.Opening schools may be as important in linking households indirectly as through direct transmission in school. For example allowing parents to go back to work, or meeting at the school gates, on public transport or in shared private vehicles, via after school social or sport activities or wrap-around care may be as important as what happens within the school.It is possible that opening schools will provide enough upward pressure on R that it goes above  having previously been below it, at least in some local areas. This will require local action and could mean societal choices that weigh up the implications of imposing limitations on dferent parts of the community and the economy.Early identication and quickly managing outbreaks of COVID- in schools is essential as part of a local response to COVID-. Clear advice for pupils and staff not to attend school with symptoms, and prompt availability of testing, appropriate isolation advice, and careful public health surveillance and monitoring of educational establishments are key to support the safeto schools”._________________________________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
