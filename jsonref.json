Pictured: Jeffrey Epstein before he killed himself in a New York prison cell \u0027It wasn\u0027t an attempt to bring down the royals, just a chance to understand the story.\u0027She added: \u0027I admire him for his candour and his engagement with the questions in an age of so much deviation and circumnavigation, and quite often a failure to put yourself up for scrutiny.\u0027During the interview, Prince Andrew said he did not recall meeting Miss Roberts and emphatically denied that he had sex with her.On the occasion she said they first met in 2001 – when she claimed she was \u0027trafficked\u0027 to Britain by Epstein – he said he spent the day with his daughter Princess Beatrice and then took her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.He also questioned Miss Roberts\u0027 account of them dancing together at the London nightclub Tramp, when she said he was sweating heavily.The Duke of York said he had suffered from a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat.He also sought to cast doubt on the authenticity of a photograph that showed him with his arm around Miss Roberts\u0027 waist, but conceded that it was difficult to prove if it was a fake.       Miss Maitlis (pictured during interview) praised the Duke for his \u0027candour\u0027 in answering her questions in an age when many public figures attempted to avoid scrutiny       Andrew admitted he had \u0027let the side down\u0027 when he had failed to cut ties with Epstein immediately after he was jailed in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor, and registered as a sex offender. The Prince said he visited him in New York in 2010, after Epstein\u0027s release, to break off the friendship, but regretted staying at his house while he was there.He told Miss Maitlis: \u0027It was not something that was becoming of a member of the Royal Family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\u0027 After the Newsnight interview was broadcast in November, several of Andrew\u0027s business sponsors for his Pitch@Palace initiative announced they would no longer back the project. Many of his royal patronages also sought to distance themselves from him and he eventually announced he was stepping down from all his patronages and his royal duties. Meanwhile Miss Roberts, now known by her married name Virginia Giuffre, gave her own interview to Panorama in which she insisted the Duke was lying when he denied meeting her.She said she had felt \u0027ashamed and dirty\u0027 after they had sex, adding: \u0027I had just been abused by a member of the Royal Family.\u0027         She told the Radio Times she had been shocked by the public reaction to Prince Andrew\u0027s TV appearance, saying: \u0027I didn\u0027t see it coming.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Incredible scene photos actors set California 1967","story":"Share this article          Actors spent roughly three hours getting their faces done, using at-the-time innovative techniques created by the make-up artist         Stock managed to capture the actors enjoying downtime while in-between takes including this goofy character posing next to two women in a carStock managed to capture the actors enjoying downtime while in-between takes, showing one ape cast member trolling a nearby town by sitting at their bus stop.Planet of the Apes was released in 1968 and said to be \u0027the year\u0027s most unusual and important picture.\u0027 The iconic film was known for its epic sets and special effects, along with the immense work that went into production. There was said to be 80 make-up artists, hair stylists and wardrobe staff who all had a hand in making the 200 apes that appeared on screen. The massive production for the film paused several other film productions with its large scope.

Fresh water means successful crops and enhanced nutrition, as well as extra family income that goes towards schoolingby Paul Miles and John YarneyWhen Akisneem Abachela’s family feels well off, they celebrate Christmas by brewing pito beer made from sorghum and eating goat meat. Otherwise, they tighten their belts and keep it simple. “When resources are scarce, we only kill guinea fowl and cook rice to celebrate Christmas,” says Abachela, an elderly widow who lives in the Garu district of rural Northern Ghana.This year, she hopes that income earned from the sales of vegetables grown on her allotment will boost the family Christmas celebrations. Abachela, who shares her family compound with some of her sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren, is able to grow and sell fresh green vegetables thanks to a special solar-powered borehole pump that was installed in her village by Oxfam two years ago. The income helps pay for essentials such as groundnut paste and school-related costs for her grandchildren.The borehole is part of wider efforts to help families on the frontline of the climate crisis build their resilience to it.Before it was installed, Abachela and neighbours in her community used open wells, some of which were fitted with manual pumps. But this water was muddy and had to be filtered and boiled before drinking. Now, instead of expending energy, they can simply turn a tap. An electric pump, powered by photovoltaic panels, draws potable water from deep below ground and stores it in two 500-litre holding tanks.“We no longer buy vegetables we plant herbaceous vegetables, beans, okra and other vegetables for domestic use,” says Abachela. “All we buy are groundnut paste and other ingredients that we can’t grow.”A lifelong semi-subsistence farmer, whose husband died 15 years ago, Abachela describes herself as “old and weak”. She has had enough of walking for miles for water in bygone days or operating a handpump. “We no longer have to walk far to get water and that has brought quite some relief,” she says with understatement.Northern Ghana has just two seasons – dry and wet. In the dry season, temperatures reach 40C. But climate breakdown is making life even more challenging, with the world’s poorest people bearing the brunt. According to a report jointly published by the United Nations Development Programme: “Evidence abounds in Ghana that temperatures in all the ecological zones are rising, whereas rainfall levels and patterns have been generally reducing and increasingly becoming erratic” – a situation experienced firsthand by Abachela and other local farmers.Droughts and floods in the wet season have an impact on the main crops of maize, millet and sorghum. When the rains are good, the fields are lush and green from May to September. But in the dry season crops can’t grow and the land lies fallow, bare and red-brown. The only shade is from baobab and shea trees. During this dry season, residents of Kpatua grow a few vegetables that they water by hand. Before the solar-powered borehole, the villagers grew these in the only suitably damp earth – that of the riverbank, over an hour’s walk away. Cattle often trampled and ate the vegetables before they could be harvested. Now, 68 villagers grow greens in a shared 1.6-hectares (four acres) garden, fenced off from livestock, sited very near their homes. The plot is irrigated with water from the adjacent solar-powered borehole.“The water is the best thing that has happened in my life,” says Joshua Ayawin, who farms and keeps cattle, goats and guinea fowl. He is also responsible for maintaining the solar panels. He washes dust from their surface, blown there by hot harmattan winds from the Sahara. In this desiccated landscape, where architecture rises organically from the ground, the 10 shiny black and silver panels look particularly striking.The water has also brought an extra, surprising, idend: the guinea fowl now lay more eggs, meaning extra family income – and enhanced nutrition for the children.She explains how they would become thirsty and dehydrated and the children would suffer stomach upsets due to dirty water. “Since then, all these things have disappeared and I don’t see them any more.”Help fight the climate emergency Families on the frontline of the climate emergency urgently need your help.

The joint Booker winners and perhaps a handful of others aside, I’m not sure that much fiction published in 2019 will be read a decade hence. The good news is that I’ve spent the past several weeks joyfully immersed in proof copies of next year’s novels and can confirm that 2020 is shaping up to be a blinder. I’ve tried here to concentrate on the first half of the year.One of the year’s biggest novels is sure to be the final instalment of Hilary Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror and the Light (4th Estate, March), which is under strict embargo. Will it be great? Probably. Will it win the Booker? Possibly (although there’s serious competition). It could well be pipped to the prize by Maggie O’Farrell’s miraculous Hamnet (Tinder Press, March) – a beautiful imagination of the short life of Shakespeare’s son, Hamnet, and the untold story of his wife, “Agnes” Hathaway, which builds into a profound exploration of the healing power of creativity.Hot on Mantel and O’Farrell’s heels are three of the next generation: Evie Wyld, Daisy Johnson and Eimear McBride. Wyld’s The Bass Rock (Jonathan Cape, March) is her third novel and her best so far. Stepping elegantly through time and weaving together the lives of a host of strong yet damaged women, this is Wyld’s masterpiece – as majestic and monumental as the landmark it’s named after. Johnson’s Sisters (Jonathan Cape, July) is a short, sharp explosion of a gothic thriller whose tension ratchets up and up to an ending of extraordinary lyricism and virtuosity. McBride’s Strange Hotel (Faber, February) is an enigmatic, achingly sad book. A woman moves shiftlessly from one hotel to the next, obeying a seemingly abstract set of rules, haunted by her past.Colum McCann’s sixth novel, Apeirogon (Bloomsbury, February), is ambitious formally and thematically, taking on the Israel-Palestine conflict in a work that is both spectacularly inventive and grounded in hard, often brutal fact. It is about grief and forgiveness, about family and politics. If you can read it without sobbing, you’re a monster. Also tugging on the heart-strings is Sebastian Barry’s A Thousand Moons (Faber, March). Set in the wake of the American civil war, it tells the story of Winona, a brave, bruised orphan from the Lakota tribe whose new life on a Tennessee farmstead is threatened by the past.AD Miller was shortlisted for the Booker in 2012 for his Moscow-set thriller Snowdrops. His latest, Independence Square (Harvill Secker, February), also looks east – this time to Ukraine. The story of Simon Davey and the mysterious Olesya is utterly gripping, a novel with its finger on the pulse of geopolitics that still manages to move deeply.From the US, we have Jenny Offill’s Weather (Granta, February). Six years after her majestic Dept of Speculation, it’s a dazzling state-of-the-nation novel that is every bit as good as its predecessor. There’s also Jeanine Cummins’s American Dirt (Tinder Press, January), the tragic tale of a mother and her beloved son on the run from a drugs lord. Kate Elizabeth Russell’s superb debut, My Dark Vanessa (4th Estate, March), is more than merely an inversion of Lolita for the #MeToo generation this is a book that asks what we have lost and gained in an era that has revolutionised the way we think about sex and power.James Scudamore has always written brilliant, twisted novels his latest, English Monsters (Jonathan Cape, March), is breathtakingly good. Imagine Edward St Aubyn writing The Secret History and you’ll get an idea of how exquisite and compelling this story about male friendship and betrayal is. Amanda Craig’s The Lie of the Land was a bestseller in 2018 and made many books-of-the-year lists. Her next, The Golden Rule (Little, Brown, June), turns upon a chance meeting on a train that leads to a murderous pact. It does what her novels do best, wrapping the reader in a tight, lean narrative, showing the strangeness that lies at the heart of normal-seeming lives. Philip Hensher’s A Small Revolution in Germany (4th Estate, February) is a beautiful, regret-soaked story about the marks left on our adult lives by the idealism of our youth.A few more to look out for: Maaza Mengiste’s The Shadow King (Canongate, January) is a complex, lyrical and compelling historical novel set during Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia. SJ Parris’s Giordano novels are always worth reading. The sixth, Execution (HarperCollins, April), is no exception – a brilliantly realised fictionalisation of the Babington plot against Elizabeth I. Nikita Lalwani’s gripping thriller You People (Viking, April) is set among undocumented migrants in a shadowy London underworld. There’s a fine second novel from Stuart Evers – The Blind Light (Picador, June) reads like a British Don DeLillo, telling the social history of Britain through two generations of a family. Finally, in A Theatre for Dreamers (Bloomsbury Circus, April), Polly Samson goes to the Greek island of Hydra to imagine the first steps in the love affair between Leonard Cohen and his Marianne. As dreamily nostalgic as Cohen’s song Famous Blue Raincoat.Along with Kate Elizabeth Russell, there are a number of hotly anticipated debuts hitting the shelves. The 28-year-old Dutch dairy farmer Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s The Discomfort of Evening (Faber, March), translated by Michelle Hutchison, is a rich and luminous novel about fate and grief. It is already a bestseller in Holland. Nazanine Hozar’s immaculate first novel, Aria (Viking, March), follows a group of Iranians in the lead-up to the 1979 revolution and marks the arrival of a major new voice. Rainbow Milk (Dialogue Books, March) by Paul Mendez is another worth looking out for – powerful, sensuous and thrillingly well written.It’s not in the first half of the year, but I’m already hugely excited about Eley Williams’s first novel, The Liar’s Dictionary (William Heinemann, July). She’s a magnificent prose stylist and I can’t wait to read her in the longer form. We can also look forward to the final part of Ali Smith’s era-defining seasonal quartet, Summer (Penguin, July) and there’s a new novel by the dependably magnificent Kate Grenville – A Room Made of Leaves (Text, July) (which I’ve read and it’s every bit as good as The Secret River). Then, in September, there’s Piranesi (Bloomsbury) by Susanna Clarke, the long-awaited new book from the author of Jonathan Strange \u0026amp Mr Norrell, and Mayflies (Faber) by the great Andrew O’Hagan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c38ba9c4f0acbcf587124034edc84835f84becad/0_0_2487_1492/master/2487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92ffcff661ace77487e130d13ead9e08","title":"get brexit done not even allowed to mention it","story":"Britain is being urged to ‘move on’ – but the prospect of crashing out after a year is very realA funny thing happened to me last Monday. I was lunching with my friend Sir Samuel Brittan, the great Financial Times economics commentator, in advance celebration of his 86th birthday. It was he who, when we were colleagues on the FT, suggested that I specialise in writing about the economy.During the lunch, several anti-Brexit sympathisers approached our table to express approval of the slogan on my pullover. It was the present from one of my daughters that I referred to here two years ago, which proclaims in large letters: “All I want for Christmas is EU.”At the end of the meal there was a general, and not especially discreet, discussion about how awful the situation was and, in particular, how disgraceful the behaviour of the man who is now our prime minister. At which point a nearby diner left the restaurant and one of the waiters said: “Do you know who that was? Johnson’s mother.”Yes, Alexander Johnson, the man who campaigned all too successfully on the slogan Get Brexit Done, but who, according to reports, has now banned government officials from using the very word Brexit on the grounds that it is “time to move on”.There are those Remainers who take comfort in the thought that in due course the principally pro-Remain younger generation will see its ranks swollen and demand that we should acknowledge this historic mistake and apply to rejoin the EU. But those of us who recall how difficult it was to join in the first place – our application was turned down twice by General de Gaulle – think this is far too optimistic. I was therefore heartened by the Christmas message from Frans Timmermans, the deputy president of the European commission: there has been damage already, and there will be more to come, but the UK “will always be welcome to come back”.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has made it clear that a year’s transition period is perilously short for negotiating future arrangements – and, indeed, that the kind of Trumpian departure from EU regulations envisaged by Johnson, Dominic Cummings and their ilk is non-negotiable with the EU. The stage is therefore set for a year’s fooling around, followed by a no-deal crash-out. This at a time when Johnson is promising a golden future for the former Labour supporters in the north of England and Midlands who have supposedly lent him their votes.So what kind of economy and outlook does Johnson inherit? As regular readers know, I did not get where I am today by making economic forecasts – the old economists’ joke is that it is difficult enough to forecast the past – but I take note of all the forecasts being made by reputable economic institutions, and they are almost all terrible. The loss of tax revenue likely to accompany the mere approach to Brexit, let alone the expected crash-out, makes Johnson’s electoral promises for the north look, well, ridiculous.Now, I am going to break my rule and make a forecast. It is a forecast of what should happen, but won’t. When Johnson returns from the West Indies and moves on from victory celebrations to the hard study of what his officials tell him, he should realise that his campaign promises are totally incompatible with the appalling economic outlook threatened by the word he does not want his officials to use.He is no Churchill, although he thinks he is, but he could do worse than study that phenomenal book by Tim Bouverie, Appeasing Hitler. Hitler was the biggest threat facing Europe, and Churchill knew it. While not wishing to compare the threat of Brexit to the threat of Hitler, I think the point is that Hitler’s intentions were always clear for those with eyes to see and ears to hear, and so are the prospects for leaving the single market and pretending we can go back to the 19th century.What Johnson should do, now that he has achieved his childhood ambition to become prime minister, is grow up, become a statesman and be big enough to say he has made a mistake. He won’t, of course. An easy forecast.Happy new year!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37bac6ac156f4f4421eb8bea71573eab835c4d4e/4_0_10660_6400/master/10660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aeaebe15912fb6c8ba84d074869dfe4","title":"neoliberal is unthinking leftist insult all it does it stifle debate","story":"Labour’s endless squabbles over ‘purity’ risk another 10 years of Tory dominanceFarewell to the 2010s. The decade was captured by an intellectually bankrupt right wing for all the wrong reasons, above all because of a fear of foreigners. Yet for all that, it did give us a measure of progress – from our smartphones to declining poverty, although even on that metric, Britain managed to buck a global trend. From the perspective of any British believer in Enlightenment values, good riddance to the dying decade.Yet in 2009, matters did not look promising for the libertarian right. New Labour had been in power for 12 years and on all the key challenges of the day, the only effective policy responses were forms of collective action, whether on climate change or terrorism, the declining effectiveness of antibiotics or the power of multinationals. The financial crash of 2008 was the consequence of hyper-deregulation, following the palpably absurd rightwing faith that markets were magic. The future lay with the left, natural believers in the power of good government and international co-operation, in particular the EU. Thoughtful Tories openly pondered whether they could ever win a general election outright again.What is obvious, looking back, is that the right did not so much win the 2010s as the liberal left lost them. And it lost because at bottom it has a fatal, isive weakness. Lack of any agreement about what being liberal left can and should mean creates a sectarianism that unless confronted consumes it, the left defining itself as the custodian of the “socialist” flame and everyone else, in varying degrees, as a traitorous “neoliberal”.The very term “neoliberal” has become a catch-all to indicate contempt for any policy position or political figure the left considers to be departing from true “socialism”, which in turn must be based on the subordination of capitalism to the state rather than its reform. This is rather as the right uses “Marxist” to describe any departure from ultra free-market principles involving state ownership or regulation. Is it Marxist for the state to own a railway or the national grid? Is it “neoliberal” to believe that some goals can be achieved without state ownership? It’s a conspiracy by both sides against evidence, thought and practice.But on the left, the passions aroused created a never-ending sectarian war. Making the compromises necessary to create a governing coalition that could exercise power is not on its agenda: the left’s struggle is all about fighting for and delivering a particular definition of socialism – or nothing.It was sectarianism that drove the enmity between the Blair and Brown camps in the New Labour government, setting up what was to follow. If David Miliband had fought either the 2010 or 2015 general elections, he would have denied David Cameron his majorities. But the Brown camp ensured any challenge before 2010 was likely to fail. Then Ed Miliband, a clever, values-driven politician but no national leader, did not resist Brown’s intense, sectarian pressure to stand against his brother in 2010. The results we know.Scrapping Labour’s carefully constructed electoral college system in which MPs, members and trade unionists each had a third of the vote for leader, Miliband created the route to power for Jeremy Corbyn after he lost in 2015. Corbyn may have been an iconic, pacifist, socialist idealist, but he was happier to campaign than govern and, as events would prove, could never be elected prime minister.Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, and his ambitious, narcissistic henchmen drank the austerity Kool-Aid and signed up for a full-blown coalition with the Tories. It was win-win-win for the Tories: relegitimation, government and a chance to crush a party that was increasingly threatening their home county heartland. Smarter Lib Dems, such as Vince Cable, excluded from the negotiations, would have offered a limited confidence and supply agreement with Cameron – and picked up even more seats in the inevitable second general election.As it was, the party became junior, virtually powerless members of a coalition government that took the crazed decision to lower the budget deficit solely with spending cuts. The resulting austerity was a crucial influence in the Brexit referendum.This was the tinder Nigel Farage was able to ignite. Blaming immigration rather than austerity for working-class hardship and conflating all immigration with the EU, he managed to raise the salience of an issue that was not even in the top 10 as late as 2012 into one that has consumed the nation. But again, had Labour been led by anyone other than the long-time Europhobe Corbyn, Remain would have won and the opportunity so brutally exploited by Boris Johnson would never have been opened up.Will the liberal left gift the 2020s to the right in the same way? The first clue will be the Labour leadership contest. If the eventual leader wins as a sworn enemy of “neoliberalism”, be sure that all constructive thought will be expunged from Labour for another electoral cycle. It is possible to believe in the power of government, the reform of capitalism, the necessity of social justice and the imperative to confront the environmental challenge and still want a vibrant, purpose-driven private sector. Shared values mean those are common ends: if the policy mix to achieve them tries to mitigate high taxation, state ownership and a proliferation of government agencies, then that strategy should not be written off as “neoliberal”.Nor can Brexit be buried. EU membership benefited Britain and Johnson’s impending hard Brexit will harm it. More than that, the EU is a noble cause and a force for good in the world. Leave voters who so desperately wanted better for themselves were sold a lie. To desert the pro-EU cause now is wrong both in principle and, as the lie becomes exposed, in practice. Johnson’s failure is not guaranteed. It remains true that addressing the challenges of our times falls more naturally to the liberal left than the right. But without the same ruthlessness about the pursuit of power, the opportunity may never arise.So: no more sectarianism, no more hurling vacuous insults at those who don’t sign up to the faith. Exploit the left’s natural advantages and back political winners. Otherwise, the right will control another decade. It is not only social democracy at stake but, as Britain dissolves into an one-party state, liberal democracy itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f1b4153a846afedf840ffc13bf6551c54f8bf24/586_431_4865_2921/master/4865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bce9201bd6c41b01f721751eb7f50b35","title":"on my radar james norton cultural highlights","story":"London-born, Yorkshire-raised actor James Norton, 34, is best known for his TV roles in Happy Valley, Grantchester, McMafia and War and Peace.

It’s exactly how you’d imagine a downtown jazz club to be: small tables, great cocktails, superb music. We saw the Javon Jackson Quartet, drank multiple vodka martinis and felt excellent. There wasn’t any dancing that night but there was chin-stroking, head-nodding and foot-tapping. Followed by enthusiastic applause, perhaps even some whooping.I watch a lot of films, so it was hard to pick one but this really stuck with me. It’s directed by Chloé Zhao, won a prize at Cannes and is about the rodeo circuit and modern-day cowboys. It has almost documentary naturalism, mostly using non-actors, which is always interesting, and its world is incredibly well realised. The lead character is played by Brady Jandreau, who’d never acted before, and he’s insanely raw and gut-wrenching. It’s bleak but also breathtakingly beautiful.

It felt awkward but we did not have the time for trains or boats.”The paper said the trip to Stockholm is estimated to have amounted to almost half a ton of carbon dioxide emissions per person.Greta started a school strike for the climate outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018, which has since spread all over the world to involve more than 100,000 schoolchildren.She takes a stand against more polluting forms of transport by sailing rather than flying or travelling in cars.Greta arrived in New York in August after a 15-day, 3,000-mile voyage across the Atlantic to take part in a UN climate summit.She sailed from Plymouth in the UK on a zero-emissions yacht to limit the carbon footprint of her travel.She then set sail in November from the US to a UN climate summit in Madrid, Spain.Ms Sands said: “Greta is not actually judgmental towards iniduals, accepting that other people will not all conform to her high standards and asking only for people to do what they can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b65208bd01b908ac9c816652646bbf0833e027b7/758_80_2057_1235/master/2057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5f76cdccfa5345cbcf60b41e1aeffe","title":"little women review greta gerwig saoirse ronan wendy ide","story":"Greta Gerwig brings the entire March family to life like never before in a respectful but bracingly current version that couldn’t be more perfectly timedOne-hundred-and-fifty-year-old literature never felt so alive. Greta Gerwig’s jostling, clamouring adaptation of Little Women is a rare achievement. Gerwig is respectful of the source material – much of the dialogue is lifted from Louisa May Alcott’s beloved book – while ensuring that her own creative input is heard. By encouraging a merry chaos of overlapping personalities and performances – restructuring the timeline into a multilayered playground where the child and adult stories interact – and subtly foregrounding existing themes of female fulfilment and the economics of creativity, Gerwig creates something that is true to its roots and bracingly current. Along with Armando Iannucci’s archly playful take on David Copperfield, this is the freshest, most light-footed literary adaptation of the past year.There’s a reason why Little Women, in print continuously since its first volume was published in 1868, has been such an enduring phenomenon, and that is Jo March. She’s passionately captured here by Saoirse Ronan, who reunites with Gerwig after starring in her directorial debut, Lady Bird (a film that, with its focus on mother-daughter relationships, female friendship and creative ambition, contains a notable thematic crossover with Little Women). Wildly imaginative, unfashionably ambitious and mutinously ungroomed, she has been the formative girl-crush for generations of wannabe writers with inky fingers and unravelling pigtails. Alcott’s alter ego, Jo hits that elusive sweet spot that makes her perennially relatable and contemporary.It was her love affair with Jo as a character that prompted Gerwig to embark on this, the latest interpretation of a book that has already been adapted for the screen, stage, television, opera and anime about 20 times. But it is the generosity of Gerwig’s affections, drawing the other members of the family, and Alcott herself, into the warm embrace of the film, that makes it such a joyous, tumultuous collision of pleasures.Alcott is inevitably present in any adaptation of Little Women but Gerwig digs deeper, into the novelist’s own history. The film is shot in and around Concord, Massachusetts, where Alcott and her family lived. Gerwig draws on the geography of the region: the vividly exuberant New England autumn colour palette flushes through the childhood scenes the modest gentility of Alcott’s own childhood home is recreated for the March family residence.Perhaps most satisfying is a deftly meta scene that addresses the point at which Alcott’s life – she remained unmarried – and Jo’s (wed to an older professor) erge. Gerwig acknowledges the commercial pressure to marry off a fictional female character, and argues that the real happy ending is the publishing of Jo’s book. That said, by casting Louis Garrel as Friedrich Bhaer, Gerwig ensures that Jo is not exactly short-changed in the husband department.In addition to Alcott, the main beneficiary of Gerwig’s inclusive approach is the youngest March sister, Amy (a magnificent Florence Pugh – what a year she has had!). While other versions of the story have painted her as bratty and spoiled, here Amy and Jo are two sides of the same coin. The brightest, most talented, most headstrong of the girls, and given to unleashing rollicking hoots of laughter at each other’s misfortune, they clash because their kinship is closer than they care to admit. At times, it seems as though this is as much Amy’s story as Jo’s. Her burgeoning relationship with Laurie (Timothée Chalamet, adorable) is teasingly persuasive: Pugh’s velvet and honey voice has never been better used. Yorick Le Saux’s camera clearly feels the same way – it is constantly sneaking smitten glances at Amy across crowded rooms. More than Emma Watson’s decorative, dull Meg and Eliza Scanlen’s sickly, reticent Beth, our eyes are drawn to Pugh’s mercurial Amy.And it’s in these chaotic rooms in the March family home that the film derives its giddy energy. Gerwig’s masterstroke is to take the dialogue as it was written by Alcott but to have her actors deliver the lines in a tumbling clutter of ideas and mass hilarity. There’s an uninhibited verve here that evokes Joe Wright’s Pride \u0026amp Prejudice.Alexandre Desplat’s unremarkable mulch of a score – one of the film’s few weak points – does little more than provide decorative wallpaper for the bustle of family life. But the design departments, both in the interiors and the costumes, excel. Laura Dern’s Marmee raises her girls in a magpie stash of bohemian jumble, punctuated with impromptu midnight baking sessions and amateur dramatics. It’s a home that radiates warmth, and not just because Gerwig borrows a trick from Tom Ford’s A Single Man, flooding the frame with lush, saturated glow at moments of joy. The home is a crucial element in Little Women. It’s not Jo’s escape to New York that allows her to find her creative voice, but her return to the heart of the family. And if that’s not the perfect sentiment for holiday viewing, I don’t know what is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/670503a1350bf5700581dc14e80b3ec5d5f0e1cc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7f1daa4e92005ba9b739abaab69b4e4","title":"mark kermode best films of 2019","story":"From the raw For Sama to the rip-roaring Rocketman, top-notch films from around the world graced the big screen.

At the 91st Oscars in February, the bland Green Book beat the superior BlackKklansman to the best picture award, although Spike Lee won his first competitive Oscar in the adapted screenplay category. Rami Malik scooped best actor for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, but best actress Olivia Colman (The Favourite) stole the evening with one of the funniest and most self-deprecating acceptance speeches ever (complete with raspberry-blowing).More significantly, Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma won for cinematography, direction and best foreign language film, despite naysayers’ complaints that Netflix-backed movies were essentially made-for-TV films. That attitude is now history: in the forthcoming awards season, the platform has several contenders, including Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story and Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman.The Irishman marked a watershed moment for “digital de-ageing”, with innovative technology allowing Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci to play characters much younger than themselves. We’ve seen de-aging elsewhere (from Captain Marvel to Gemini Man), but never this unobtrusively. Alongside the release of its first original animated feature, Sergio Pablos’s Klaus, Netflix also picked up distribution rights for I Lost My Body, which made history when it took the top prize in the Critics’ Week section at Cannes in May. More family-friendly releases – Frozen II, Toy Story 4 and a weirdly photorealist rehash of The Lion King – may have dominated the box office in 2019, but I Lost My Body was my favourite animated film of the year.Other Cannes firsts included Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite (which opens here in February) becoming the first Korean film to win the Palme d’Or while French-Senegalese film-maker Mati Diop was the first black female film-maker to direct a Palme d’Or contender with the Grand Prix winner Atlantics. The Cannes best actor award went to Antonio Banderas for his career-best turn in Pedro Almodóvar’s semi-autobiographical Pain and Glory.A range of high-quality films from around the world graced UK cinemas in 2019. From Colombia we had Birds of Passage, an arresting tale of gangsters and spirits from the creators of Embrace of the Serpent. Writer-director Nadine Labaki earned an Oscar nomination with Capernaum, about a young boy’s struggles in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Icelandic actor Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir excelled in Woman at War, a jet-black eco-warrior comedy featuring onscreen musical accompaniment with drums, accordion and sousaphone.This year also saw a plethora of brilliant film scores. Standouts included Clint Mansell’s ethereal Out of Blue soundtrack Anna Meredith’s mesmerising electronica accompaniment to Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade Alex Weston’s unexpectedly quirky music for The Farewell and Mica Levi’s otherworldly score for Monos. My favourite score was by Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, who lent real depth to one of 2019’s most successful and controversial releases, Joker.Great scores weren’t confined to drama: Nainita Desai provided excellent understated accompaniment to For Sama, an astonishing documentary about life under siege in Aleppo, filmed by Syrian citizen-journalist Waad al-Kateab. Matt Morton’s music took audiences into space in Apollo 11, a documentary released on the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing. More down to earth (although no less ecstatic) was Amazing Grace, the long-delayed film of Aretha Franklin’s two-night performance at the New Temple Missionary Baptist church in Los Angeles in 1972.This year also proved to be remarkable for talent grown closer to home. In April, Irish actor and singer Jessie Buckley shone in Tom Harper’s Wild Rose, about a single mother living in Glasgow but dreaming of country music stardom in Nashville. In May, Dexter Fletcher’s Rocketman channelled the spirit of Ken Russell as it turned Elton John’s life into a rip-roaring pop fantasia. June saw the release of Dirty God, boasting a star-making turn from feature first-timer Vicky Knight. And in July, Only You was an extraordinary feature debut from writer-director Harry Wootliff.As summer turned to autumn, Joanna Hogg gave us The Souvenir, in which Honor Swinton Byrne and Tom Burke excelled in a close-to-life story of a relationship built upon deceit. From writer-director Shola Amoo came another autobiographically inspired work, The Last Tree, about a British-Nigerian boy being uprooted from an idyllic rural childhood to face life on the mean streets of London.My favourite film of 2019 was Bait, the breakthrough feature from Cornish film-maker Mark Jenkin. An authentic portrait of tensions between locals and tourists in a once-thriving fishing village, it was shot with clockwork cameras on grainy 16mm stock, which Jenkin hand-processed in his studio in Newlyn.I hope Bait gets the recognition it deserves at the Baftas, alongside films like Ordinary Love, in which Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson play a couple facing her diagnosis of breast cancer.As for the Oscars, it would be good to see nominations for Rian Johnson’s whodunnit Knives Out, Jordan Peele’s chiller Us, and Greta Gerwig’s literary adaptation Little Women, all of which injected new life into die-hard cinematic genres.1. BaitMark Jenkin’s masterpiece is one of the defining British films of the decade.2. MonosAn extraordinary fable of child soldiery from Colombian-Ecuadorian film-maker Alejandro Landes.3. Ordinary LoveCo-directors Glenn Leyburn and Lisa Barros D’Sa work wonders with Owen McCafferty’s superb sceenwriting debut.4.

It was never mentioned to me that they are traditionally served to bring wealth and good fortune. On first impressions I cannot imagine anything less bling than a lentil yet what they evoke in me is a great sense of comfort and wellbeing, which is just what I need now.At New Year they are supposed to side up to cotechino, a fat sausage that is laced with pork skin and spices and quite delicious. Instead I’ve adapted a southern Italian dish of sausages and lentils. With careful cooking you will understand their status.There’s also baked whole radicchio with grapes, an exercise in bitter-sweet, best served in its baking dish and eaten with bread at the table.And for dessert, cartelatte, one of the fried dough sweets common in Puglia at this time of year. They are my firm favourites. While they can keep, my advice is to eat them quickly – I assure you they are so moreish you won’t be able to do anything else.It’s your basic soffritto-style start as much as the sausage that imparts the substantial flavour base needed to make this dish special. Tend to it carefully, adding the liquid in small amounts. Serves 4To make a soffritto, dice the celery, carrots and fennel fairly small, almost lentil size. Begin to sweat them over a medium heat in 2 tbsp of olive oil with a pinch of saltWash the lemon, quarter and cut the segments into three pieces each. Rinse the lentils in a sieve.Add garlic to the soffritto, followed by the bay leaves. Squeeze pieces of sausage meat from their skins straight into the pot. Add the lentils, potatoes, lemon, cinnamon and passata and then cover with an inch of cold water. Bring to the boil and then turn down to a simmer.Cook adding cupfuls of water when needed. In this dish, the lentils should be completely soft, not al dente. This will take about 50 minutes.Turn the heat off, check the seasoning and add a liberal glug of olive oil.It’s possible to make this look like a still life from the National Gallery. Serves 4chestnuts 100g, whole, raw or pre-cookedradicchio 2 headsblack grapes 150g, small, cut into clustersgarlic 3 cloves, cut in halfsage ½ buncholive oilfennel seeds 1 tspgrappa 75ml, or brandybutter a knobHeat the oven to 190Cgas mark 5.If preparing your own chestnuts, score with a sharp knife. Roast uncovered in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the shell and skin come away. Don’t worry if they are not yet cooked through. Peel them.Wash the radicchio, removing any shabby outer leaves and trimming the end of the stalk. Place in a baking dish surrounded by the chestnuts, grapes, garlic, sage and fennel seeds. Drizzle with oil, season well and drench with alcohol and an equal amount of water. Place a knob of butter on top, cover tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour until tender under a knife.If you can, get hold of a proper good cream local to you. Serves 4Swiss chard 800gsalt and peppercream 200mlgarlic ½ clove, peeled and finely slicedthyme 1 sprig, leaves pickedolive oil or butternutmegWash and roughly chop the chard. Boil in plenty of rolling salted water. Drain after 5 minutes, or when tender. Once cool enough, squeeze the excess water out.Over a medium-low heat, in a small pan, cook the cream with the garlic, thyme leaves and a pinch of salt. Allow it to reduce by at least half. After a few minutes it will be bubbling and thick. Turn the heat off and add 1 tbsp of olive oil or a knob of butter, and a scratch of nutmeg and pepper.Stir the chard through the cream, returning briefly to the heat, if you think it needs it.These fried rosettes are a very traditional Italian sweet. I recommend watching online videos of people making these to fully get the gist in case my description of the shaping process and the photograph isn’t enough. And remember, fried dough tastes good in any shape. Usually dipped in vincotto, here they’re served with warmly spiced, winey pears. Serves 4For the pears:pears 2white wine 375mlhoney 80gginger 4cm piece, peeled and chopped in 4orange ½, rind pareddried figs 2, choppedcider or wine vinegar 1 tspFor the dough:tipo 00 or pasta flour 200g, plus extra for dustingolive oil 100mlwhite wine 100mlsalt a pinchsunflower oil for deep fryingPeel the pears and slice into segments. Set in a pot with the wine, honey, ginger, orange peel and figs. Bring to the boil and then lower to a simmer. Turn the pears from time to time and cook until their flesh looks translucent and the liquid is thickened and syrupy. Stir in the vinegar, turn off the heat and set aside.Mix all the dough ingredients together in a stand mixer with the flat beater, or in a bowl with a spoon. Move to a work surface and knead for 5 minutes until more smooth. Set aside in a bowl and leave the dough to rest for 30 minutes.Take a piece of dough and roll on a lightly floured surface, dusting with a little flour and turning as you go. Once you have a piece 2-3mm thick – like thick pasta – cut it into ribbons about 4cm wide. These could be cut with a ravioli cutter. (It is common, but unnecessary, to roll these out with a pasta machine, moving down the numbers.)Take a piece of dough and firmly pinch the top to the bottom, along the long edge, to close one end. Place one thumb just after this closure and use the thumb and forefinger of your other hand to pinch the dough shut around your thumb, so you’ve created a little open cup in the ribbon. Place your thumb again after this pinch and repeat, and so on. Once the whole strip is formed with open cups. Curl it up to make a rose shape, pinching it together at intervals. Repeat with all the dough.Heat the oil in a high sided pan for deep frying. When an offcut of dough sizzles and begins to colour, the oil is hot enough. Fry the cartellate in batches, open side down first, turning after a minute to check doneness. When they are golden and crisp, move to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Place them upside down to drain excess oil.Gently reheat the syrup and pears, then lift out the pears. Place the cartellate in the syrup, cup-side down, and have them soak up as much as possible. Transfer to a serving plate and cover them with the pears and remaining syrup.

The Chilean has overseen an awful run of form and had been under pressure weeks before defeat to a much-rotated Leicester side proved the final straw for West Ham’s owners, David Gold and David Sullivan. Mario Husillos, a close Pellegrini ally, has also left his role as director of football after a series of mistakes in the transfer market.West Ham are a point above the bottom three and their need for a quick fix means they have not targeted managers at other clubs, ruling out moves for Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe, Burnley’s Sean Dyche and Dalian Yifang’s Rafael Benítez.Moyes, who was linked with Everton before Carlo Ancelotti’s appointment at Goodison Park earlier this month, has been out of work since leaving the east London outfit after keeping them up in the 2017-18 season and it is hoped he will finalise a deal to return on a long-term basis on Sunday, meaning he will be in charge for Wednesday’s crucial home game against Bournemouth.The former Everton manager did not leave West Ham on good terms. He was hired on an initial six-month contract after Slaven Bilic was fired in November 2017 and was tasked with keeping West Ham in the Premier League. While he did that with two games to spare, supporters were unhappy with the side’s style of play and Moyes, who struggled to convince the board that he was worthy of a long-term deal, left after growing aggrieved at his treatment. West Ham began a search for a “high-calibre figure” and Pellegrini would soon be hired on a three-year contract worth £7m a year.However Moyes does not hold a grudge against West Ham and he can count on support from within the boardroom. Gold is a big fan of Moyes, thought it was a mistake to let him leave in the first place and has been pushing for a reunion for a while. The problem in 2018, however, was that Sullivan, who holds far more power than Gold, had a different vision to Moyes and wanted a coach who played attractive football and could attract exciting players.Yet it has not worked out for Pellegrini, whose dismissal comes after a run of nine defeats in 13 league matches, and Moyes is a strong favourite to replace the former Manchester City manager, even though Chris Hughton and Tony Pulis have also been considered. While that is unlikely to sit well with a fanbase which has grown disenchanted since the move to the London Stadium, Moyes can point to how he revived Marko Arnautovic during his first spell at West Ham, not to mention the fact he was working with a limited and unbalanced squad.West Ham are crying out for a manager to organise a leaky defence and they need a more solid structure away from the pitch. They need a manager with a record of building sides someone to give them stability. Before the end of his first spell Moyes had plans to emulate his successes at Everton by turning West Ham into a top-eight club. He spoke about the need for better training facilities and pushed for greater control over signings. He wanted the club to be cannier in the transfer market.Moyes, who could ask Alan Irvine, Chris Woods and Stuart Pearce to be part of his backroom staff, inherits a badly underperforming squad. West Ham tried to be patient with Pellegrini, especially after he lost Lukasz Fabianski to a serious hip injury in September, but successive 2-1 defeats against Crystal Palace and Leicester over the Christmas period convinced the club to act.The loss of Fabianski, who returned in goal against Leicester, proved calamitous. The goalkeeper’s deputy, Roberto Jiménez, put in a string of awful displays, destroying the team’s confidence and raising doubts over Pellegrini’s judgment. The signing of Roberto on a free transfer last summer was down to Pellegrini, who was handed £100m to spend in the summer of 2018, and Husillos.Husillos, Pellegrini’s pick as director of football rather than the club’s, has been under pressure for a while. Roberto is not the only recent signing who has flopped. Andriy Yarmolenko, a £17m buy from Borussia Dortmund, is up for sale. Carlos Sánchez and Albian Ajeti have also disappointed, Sébastien Haller has struggled up front since his £45m move from Eintracht Frankfurt last summer and Pellegrini’s insistence on signing Jack Wilshere on a free transfer has backfired. Wilshere is rarely fit, leaving West Ham’s ponderous midfield short of options."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d809d9f39027e7ddffab711fe1dd48aeb583751/38_69_1529_917/master/1529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfd06334ce4c0c25599a8979da9a5e07","title":"arsenal v chelsea premier league live","story":"74 min: Abraham, Willian and Mount combine and Chelsea carve open the Arsenal back line, with David Luiz whacking Mount’s cross in search of Abraham clear for a corner. The resulting corner leads to Abraham towering above his marker, only to nod straight at Bernd Leno.73 min: Another booking, this time for Torreira for tugging on Mount’s shirt. Arsenal have moved deeper, Chelsea are going the other way.72 min: Lacazette buys Arsenal a free-kick after a challenge by Jorginho. Some much-needed respite for Arteta’s side, who have begun to fade.70 min: Hudson-Odoi replaces Kovacic, who has had better games.69 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi has been given a pep talk by Joe Edwards, the Chelsea assistant first-team coach. Lampard is not hanging around he will feel Hudson-Odoi can hurt an Arsenal defence that have kept just three clean sheets in the league all season.66 min: Lamptey shoots infield before slipping Abraham in inside the box. Abraham delays taking the shot on, subsequently allowing David Luiz to bite back at his man. In the end Abraham’s shot is blocked and the chance dissipates.65 min: Chelsea are patiently probing, seemingly waiting to strike. Frank Lampard’s side are in the ascendency. Can Arsenal turn the tide back in their favour? They have not had too much to shout about in this half.62 min: Mustafi and Rüdiger are back on their feet and moving. Good news. Back to the action, then. And Kanté’s influence seems to be growing. Arsenal’s grasp on this game is not as tight as it was.60 min: A lengthy stoppage – both players are continuing to receive treatment for that clash of heads – allows Chelsea to make a change. Fikayo Tomori, who has struggled at right-back, is replaced by the 19-year-old defender Tariq Lamptey, who is on for his Premier League debut. Among those up in the posh seats are George Graham, Petr Cech and the England assistant Steve Holland.57 min: Chelsea are beginning to put a few building blocks together. They win a corner through Kanté and the Frenchman ends up whipping a dangerous ball into the box after Willian rolled the ball into his feet. Leno punches Kanté’s cross clear and then there is a stoppage after a clash of heads between Mustafi and Rüdiger. Mustafi had done brilliantly to make life difficult. 55 min: Lacazette is riled after breezing beyond Jorginho, who then tugs at the Arsenal forward’s shirt. Pawson has no choice but to book the Italy midfielder, who is desperate to stay out of further trouble. As he lays on the floor, a mini melee ensues but it is all relatively tame and the fire soon goes out.54 min: N’Golo Kanté robs Özil on the edge of the Chelsea box before driving upfield and freeing Willian. In the end Chelsea make a hash of it and the move breaks down but Chelsea are at least asking questions of an Arsenal team that were untroubled in the first half. And now things are spicing up ...52 min: “This isn’t a particularly rancorous game, but it would be amazing if there isn’t a red card before the end – and Mustafi hasn’t even committed a bad tackle yet,” emails Charles Antaki. “Plenty of time.”50 min: Arteta is livid as Nelson is upended by Zouma after ghosting past Jorginho. Nelson is adamant it is a foul but Craig Pawson is unmoved. 48 min: Chelsea have arguably played better in the opening three minutes of this second half than the entire first 45 minutes. Another ball in to Abraham causes panic in the Arsenal box before David Luiz ushers it back to Leno. Chelsea’s tails are up and Arsenal could do with extinguishing the visitors’ newfound optimism.47 min: David Luiz is booked for a clumsy foul on Willian. Cue a hearty rendition of ‘Chelsea reject’ chants from the pocket of away supporters. The visitors earn a chance to fizz a ball into the box, 30 yards from goal. Mount plays a looping ball towards the back post and it is headed back across goal, before dropping to Kanté, who volleys wide. A decent chance.46 min: Lacazette rolls the ball to Aubameyang and, just like that, Arsenal get the second half started at the Emirates Stadium.Half-time encouragement for Arsenal, courtesy of Opta: this is the 16th time Arsenal have led Chelsea at half-time in a Premier League tie – they have never lost against them from this position, winning 12 games and drawing three ...More on that Erling Braut Haaland news: Borussia Dortmund have pulled off a coup to land the Norway striker on a deal until 2024. The 19-year-old has scored 16 goals in 14 appearances in the Austrian top ision this season:Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 13th goal of the season is the difference at the interval and, in truth, Arsenal have been far superior to Chelsea from start to finish. As a result, Frank Lampard goes jogging down the tunnel as soon as Craig Pawson blows his whistle. In the final minute of first-half stoppage-time Aubameyang proved he is happy to do the dirty work, too, making a fine block to deny Fikayo Tomori a clean shot at goal. So far, so good for Mikel Arteta, whose side could have doubled their advantage through Lacazette.45 min: There will be five added minutes.44 min: David Luiz goes flying through on N’Golo Kanté after beating the Chelsea midfielder to the ball. Kanté looks despairingly at Craig Pawson, who presumably did not see David Luiz’s stupidity. It was silly, more than anything.43 min: Aubameyang rattles the side netting! Saka slides the forward in inside the box and the Arsenal skipper opts to take the shot on early. And why not? He has 13 goals for the season, after all. He darts into plenty of space between the Chelsea defenders but his shot zooms into the side netting.42 min: Tomori does well to intervene just as Saka seemed to be making hay down the left. Arsenal are probing in search of a second after going a little cold following the arrival of Jorginho, who has brought a sense of calm to Chelsea.40 min: A nugget of breaking news hundreds of miles from the Emirates Stadium ... Erling Braut Haaland has signed for Borussia Dortmund. The 19-year-old joins from RB Salzburg.36 min: Chelsea should equalise! They win a corner after upping the ante, with Abraham driving at the Arsenal backline and, when the inswinger comes in, Azpilicueta flicks it on and it drops kindly at the back post for Kurt Zouma but he cannot make a connection. Chelsea have been vastly improved since Jorginho stepped on to the field and since switching to a 4-3-3. In the buildup to that corner, Abraham was adamant Guendouzi fouled him inside the box – the Arsenal midfielder tugged at his shirt – but the contact was relatively tame. The VAR was having none of it, anyway.34 min: Here comes Jorginho. Emerson Palmieri is the player sacrificed he has endured a forgettable half-hour or so. Lampard looks a picture of calm but the Chelsea manager must be seething inside. His side have been second best in every department. Arsenal have been lapping it up.33 min: Antonio Rüdiger is booked for a crude challenge on Torreira. Azpilicueta escaped without a yellow card for that tackle a moment ago but Chelsea have been keeping the referee Craig Pawson busy.32 min: César Azpilicueta is the latest Chelsea player to be pulled up for a foul, this time on Lacazette after neat buildup play by Aubameyang. Chelsea cannot get near Arsenal, who have been unusually assured. Arteta will be delighted. Saying that, they still only have a one-goal buffer despite their dominance.30 min: And now N’Golo Kanté picks up a yellow card for manhandling Lucas Torreira. Chelsea have been shocking, so much so that it seems Lampard, Jody Morris and Joe Edwards are seeking changes. Jorginho looks ready for action.29 min: Mount is booked for a late challenge on Maitland-Niles.28 min: Has this been Arsenal’s best 28 minutes of the season? They have been dynamic, organised and aggressive. Chelsea, on the other hand ..22 min: Chambers limps off without the need for a stretcher – but his game is over. Mustafi replaces the Arsenal defender.21 min: Shkodran Mustafi is stripped to come on ...20 min: Calum Chambers is in trouble. The Arsenal defender is not going to be able to carry on after landing awkwardly in an innocuous challenge with Abraham. Chambers requires treatment, which will allow Chelsea some respite. They have been under the cosh from the get-go.17 min: Arsenal almost double their lead! Nelson does brilliantly down the right flank, bending a wonderful cross towards the back post, where Aubameyang nonchalantly lays a ine ball off for Lacazette. The striker dawdles ever so slightly and N’Golo Kanté is able to make life difficult. It would have capped a gorgeous attacking Arsenal move. And it came moments after Lacazette lost his footing on the edge of the box under pressure from Kurt Zouma. At one point the referee Craig Pawson looked set to blow his whistle but Lacazette soldiered on before eventually surrendering possession. Arsenal twice had Chelsea on the ropes.16 min: Arteta asked for aggression from his Arsenal side and it is a case of so far so good. They’re on the front foot. Chelsea are wilting. They’re all over the place. Blue shirts must have had only a handful of touches.15 min: Tammy Abraham catches Lucas Torreira on halfway, and ends up injuring himself in the process. Torreira is also momentarily down. Both are soon up and moving, though. Chelsea are struggling to thread passes together. They’re struggling.Who else? Aubameyang heads home after Chambers erted an Özil corner towards the back post, where the Arsenal skipper was lurking. Arteta punches the air. Arsenal reap the rewards after an early, convincing swell of pressure. Aubameyang has scored half of Arsenal’s 26 league goals this season. Not bad going.11 min: Willian rolls the ball to Mount, who wellies it at goal! Quick thinking by Chelsea and the Arsenal goalkeeper Leno gets a little good fortune after failing to take all of the sting out of Mount’s strike. It bounces to safety and Arsenal aim to fly forward down the other end through Maitland-Niles.10 min: Guendouzi picks up a booking. A clumsy foul on Willian, just as the Chelsea midfielder was bouncing towards the box. Chelsea win a free-kick on the edge of the 18-yard box. Willian and Mount are stood over it. It’s way out on the left flank. Presumably one of them will lift it into the box ...8 min: David Luiz powers a free-kick at Kepa from 25 yards! It’s a routine save for the Chelsea goalkeeper but another positive tick in the box for Arsenal, who have made a brilliant start in Arteta’s first home game in charge. The free-kick stemmed from Tomori clobbering a freewheeling Mesut Özil.7 min: Big news out of Hertha Berlin ... Salomon Kalou has been excused from training so that he can find a new club. As for Granit Xhaka, who is absent at the Emirates this afternoon, the Bundesliga club are mightily keen on completing a deal. Let’s watch this space on that one. His omission makes a January departure seem inevitable. Back to the football ...5 min: David Luiz goes for an overhead kick! A wondrous, spectacular attempt ... but it doesn’t come off for the Arsenal defender against his former club. The Brazilian tried to hook the ball goalwards from a corner under pressure from Rüdiger. It bobbles wide and Chelsea earn some early respite.3 min: Tomori is over-exuberant in the challenge on Reiss Nelson after the winger latches on to a neat flick by Mesut Özil. The subsequent free-kick is floated in from the right but Chelsea head it clear. Lampard’s side are yet to settle. Arsenal will be happy with this high-tempo start, that’s for sure.2 min: Arsenal are hogging the ball in the early stages. Chelsea are yet to get a whiff. A reminder this a meeting between the ision’s youngest managers (Arteta is 37 and Lampard 41). Arsenal surge down the right ...1 min: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looks pumped. David Luiz nudges the ball out of defence and the Arsenal captain skips a couple of challenges before trying to breeze beyond Antonio Rüdiger. Encouraging start, and one that has whipped up the home faithful, just as Mikel Arteta wanted.Chelsea get things started. Mount rolls the ball to Kovacic.Here come the teams at the Emirates ...“Özil played very well v Bournemouth, and with a few finishes from Lacazette, Arsenal could have had another win on the road,” emails Kim Doyle from Maryland. “A performance by Özil, keeping the ball in the final third of the pitch is crucial for Arsenal. As he goes, so goes the Gunners on the offensive. The defence has to avoid mistakes, especially in the first 20 minutes.”Indeed, Arteta stopped short of waxing lyrical of Özil but was let it be known he was impressed with his display. “He worked and could have been the difference we could have scored three or four goals from his balls through,” Arteta said. “To be fair his attitude in training since the day I walked into the building has been incredible. I said I was going to give a clean slate.”Across London, some news:David Moyes is set to make an unlikely return to West Ham United, who have asked the Scot to save them from relegation for the second time in three seasons after firing Manuel Pellegrini. Mario Husillos, a close Pellegrini ally, has also left his role as director of football after a series of mistakes in the transfer market.Do not make David Luiz angry. It is rarely a good idea, as Chelsea have discovered to their cost, and Frank Lampard looked as though he could see the value in treading carefully as he prepared for Sunday’s derby, when he will come up against his one-time teammate and the player he sold in August.The last time Arteta duelled with Lampard? 13 September 2014. Sort of. Arteta was a stoppage-time substitute at the Emirates Stadium, where Lampard made his long-awaited City debut – but it only lasted 45 minutes with the midfielder, then on loan from New York City, booked and then hooked in favour of Samir Nasri at the interval. The game finished 2-2, with Jack Wilshere and Alexis Sánchez on scoresheet for Arsenal and Sergio Agüero and Martín Demichelis coming up with the goods for City. In total the pair played against each other 10 times during their playing careers, with Arteta winning three, Lampard two and the other five matches being drawn.Team news news: Granit Xhaka misses out through a mysterious illness, 48 hours on from his agent saying that the midfielder was dead keen on a move to Hertha Berlin. A €25m deal has been mooted by the Bundesliga club.

Emily Weiss, founder and ‘disruptor’, shares her vision for the cosmetics industry that’s made her start-up worth $1.2bn in five yearsHalfway down an expensive shopping street in Covent Garden, a few weeks before Christmas, two women stand outside a large glassy facade, wielding clipboards with intent. Their presence suggests the opening of an exclusive club, perhaps, or the private view for a buzzy new art exhibition. There is a small, discreet “Glossier” on each door. In two days’ time, this London pop-up for the cosmetics and skincare brand will open to customers, who will begin to form queues that snake down the street. Social media will be filled with glowing Glossier hashtags and posts demanding that the brand “take my money”, alongside artfully filtered pictures of its floral rooms, each decorated in bespoke, multicoloured, William Morris-inspired wallpaper. This is retail as theatre, and Glossier is a hot ticket.For now, only invited influencers and editors flit through its floral chambers, nibbling on macarons, sipping Champagne and snapping pics. The back room, in particular, is a hit. It has no products in it, just a recreation of the rooftop of a London house, almost life-sized, millennial pink, Rachel Whiteread by way of The Virgin Suicides. Guests pose in the Glossier-branded mirror that fills the wall opposite, the chimney stacks looming over their shoulders. Other mirrors bear the three feel-good words that sum up the ethos of the company that many say has shown the beauty industry a new way to operate. They are a gentle squeeze of the shoulder, an affirming pep talk, a stranger’s compliment on the bus: “You Look Good.”Emily Weiss arrived in London on a red-eye flight from New York last night, and she mingles with her guests like a seasoned pro. Weiss set up Glossier when she was just 29, and in its short lifetime – she is now 34 – the brand has become culturally pertinent and financially impressive. In March 2019, Glossier was valued at $1.2bn, turning Weiss into one of the rare female founders and CEOs of a unicorn company. The majority of Glossier sales are digital and its business thrives on its devoted online community, but it has two permanent stores, in Los Angeles and New York, where it has its HQ, and it occasionally opens hype-inducing temporary pop-ups, like the one we are in now. In the soft-corporate language that hangs around like fragrant perfume, we are not in a shop, but having an “experience”.After the visitors have gone, I sit down with Weiss in a corner of the room, encased in yellow flowers. She is erudite and thoughtful, and very good at talking, particularly when it comes to the brand she built up from four products to this. She points out that there are still only 36 Glossier products. Its minimalism is a canny part of its identity, making everything seem essential. “If you look at Sephora, for example, they have 12,000,” says Weiss. “This is a different kind of beauty experience. You don’t need a store this big for 36 products. We could do this in a vending machine.”So why do it at all?“It’s more about the beauty of coming in here and having it sound a certain way, smell a certain way, having an interaction with an editor who’s fun or engaging,” she says. Glossier staff are known as “offline editors”, and sport utilitarian pink boiler suits, wearing their gender pronouns on badges. “Or it’s about meeting someone in line waiting outside, who uses the same products or is from the same town or has the same hair and you talk about where you get it cut. It’s really about bringing people together.”People are the key to Weiss’s vision, which has disrupted the traditional cosmetics industry business model and has set a new blueprint for success. She often talks about the “democratisation” of beauty, about how Glossier came up with its products by asking women what they wanted, rather than telling women what they needed. She built awareness through word-of-mouth on social media, and the community that lives for its famous pink bubblewrap bags, chic design and solid, functional basics is deeply loyal. The official Glossier account has 2.4m Instagram followers, but there are unofficial spinoffs, like Dogs of Glossier (the shops are pet-friendly) and Glossier Boyfriends (bored partners posing with face creams). “We think a lot about hospitality rather than traditional sales,” says Weiss. Her goal is for “people to leave here and go to brunch the next day and be like, oh my God, I went to Glossier yesterday.”Though it may sound corny in theory, the strategy is clearly working. I thought my own expertise in cosmetics extended to which supermarket moisturiser doesn’t give me spots, yet the cleverness of the brand is to insist that everyone is its target audience, even me. It is almost subliminal it turns out I have plenty of Glossier in my makeup bag. A friend recently reminded me that the only beauty product she’d ever heard me talk about was Glossier’s Boy Brow, a sort of pomade that plumps the eyebrows. I ask Weiss how she made that happen, without me even realising? She looks both pleased and patient. “With something like Boy Brow, we don’t build the hype, we build the product,” she insists. “We built the product based on listening.”When she created Glossier, Weiss was running a cult beauty blog, Into the Gloss, which she had set up while she was working as assistant to Elissa Santisi, the then style director at US Vogue. On Into the Gloss, Weiss regularly asked women to show her their beauty routines for The Top Shelf (a precursor to the now common #shelfie). She used the insights from hundreds of interviews – “from Kim Kardashian to the girl with pink hair who worked at a coffee shop and had cool style” – to build up an idea of what women might want from a cosmetics brand. She had noticed, in the case of Boy Brow, that women liked to style their eyebrows, but often found that brow gel was too crunchy. “I’m like, what if there were a product that deposited some colour, but wasn’t crunchy, wasn’t flaky, didn’t separate your hairs so that you could see skin through it so much, beefed up your brows, made them look a little feathery?” Last year, they sold a Boy Brow every 32 seconds.When Weiss was rummaging through bathroom cabinets, she recognised that all the women she met shared a certain sense of shame when it came to their beauty routines. “I realised how sheepish otherwise very confident women were about beauty,” she explains. “It’s indicative of some sort of societal conditioning and beliefs that admitting to liking beauty must mean you’re frivolous or not very bright or can’t be taken seriously.”Does she really think that attitude still persists? “For sure. You can look to someone like Kim Kardashian, and look at how much people will dismiss her as a business person, probably in part because – does she wear a blazer, and show up as a business person?” Weiss is wearing a blazer, with big, stompy biker boots she looks like a business person, but also like you’re meeting an extremely well put-together friend for lunch. “So I think that the standards and the norms are changing, but there are still a lot of micro-judgments passed on women, based on how they look.”At Vogue, Weiss noticed something else while backstage at shoots and fashion shows. “One of the things I realised really early was that at every makeup artist’s table, they’d lay out all their products from their kit, and almost half of the stuff was skincare.” She passed this on to her friends and Into the Gloss readers. “In order for your makeup to look better, start with a skincare routine. Even my friends were like, ‘Oh if I want to look good, I’ll just put on a bunch of makeup.’ I really wanted to help people understand that that was a way to start a step earlier.”I ask Weiss if she thinks Glossier is responsible for the rise of no-makeup makeup, the barely-there look. “I think some of that might be from what we’ve been doing,” she says, carefully. “I also think that’s the way the world is moving. People are spending more time on making social media content, and less time doing full faces of makeup, because there’s a new filter every day that can give you a new look.” Makeup sales, she says, have flatlined in the US, while skincare sales are rising. Glossier, with its early focus on skincare and its positive, you-look-good affirmations, is already in the perfect place.Weiss grew up in Connecticut, within commuter distance of New York City her father was in business, her mother a stay-at-home mum. “I have always really liked fashion, but it was totally inaccessible for me. I didn’t grow up with money to go buy designer clothes,” she says. She babysat for a neighbour who worked for Ralph Lauren, and when she was 15, asked if she could intern at the company.Later, she studied art at New York University, interned at Chanel, then at Teen Vogue. She appeared on a couple of episodes of early reality show The Hills. When she graduated she became a fashion assistant at W magazine, then went to Vogue. She was still at Vogue when Into the Gloss began to look like a success. She was running the site between 4am and 8am and eventually had a choice to make.“There was a real fork-in-the-road moment where I just couldn’t do both,” she recalls. “I felt like I just had to take a leap.” Was that scary? “Not really,” she shrugs.I wonder how much the $1.2bn valuation of Glossier, which now employs 200 people, changed things for Weiss. “It’s a lot of responsibility, but the responsibility is to our customers and our community,” she says, impeccably on message. She admits it’s different to how it was just five years ago, when they were 10 people in an office, preparing to press go on the early Glossier site, which had just four products to sell. “We had no idea if anyone would even care. So here you are sitting with a year’s worth of work and products and, you know, heart and soul and sweat and tears. How are the stakes any less high than that?”Is she good under pressure? “I think so. I have a very normal everyday life. I hang out with friends from college and we go on vacation together.” My knowledge of life as a CEO is drawn almost exclusively from Succession and those “how I do it” diaries where executives talk of moon dust smoothies and 3am workouts, but Weiss says it’s not like that at all. “On Fridays I go to my friend’s apartment and we make pizzas with her two-year-old. I’m in my mid-30s, so I make sure I’m taking care of my body, but I’m not a maniacal fitness person. That’s never going to be me. I kind of just go to work and go home.”A few days before we met, Weiss was named as one of Time magazine’s Next 100 they called her “one of her generation’s great disruptors” and she was asked to give a speech. “I was very nervous,” she admits. She spoke about how the beauty industry had “historically made people, mostly women, feel they aren’t enough”, and spoke brightly of today’s “courageous, resilient, unflappable” teenage girls. “To girls everywhere, may you know how much power you have to change the world,” she said, finishing her speech to great applause.The Emily Weiss I encounter today seems so unflappable that I assume she must have felt like a powerful teenage girl herself. “I don’t think anyone’s ever asked me that.” She pauses. “I was not a popular kid. One of the things I’m grateful to my parents for is that they always encouraged me to find my voice and didn’t ever silence it. Even when teachers would say I was hyper,” she laughs. “Or, you know, kids would think I was too much.” She seems momentarily reflective. “What was your question? Did I feel powerful? I think I probably did, for those reasons, even when I felt like people, or society, were trying to keep that down.”The Glossier aesthetic, if you could sum it up, is a dewy glow, a kind of low radiance, to look as if you’ve just come in from a crisp winter’s walk, or an afternoon in the sun. In her essay Always be Optimizing, the writer Jia Tolentino cites Glossier as an example of the way we “idealise beauty that appears to require almost no intervention” in many ways, you can argue that the “natural” look is harder to attain if one is not naturally beautiful to begin with.But Weiss is nothing if not ambitious she wants to redefine the concept of beauty itself. She returns to the shame women felt when they were showing her their products for Into the Gloss. “There is judgment or narrow-mindedness about beauty, and what that word even means. I don’t think beauty is something anyone should feel ashamed about appreciating or acknowledging or demonstrating or embodying, and it has very little to do with looks at all. I think it has to do with your lived experience.”As the days pass, more and more of my friends who live and work in the city start to mention they’ve been to the pop-up. They have erted long runs to pass by, or sent in boyfriends for gifts, or spent their lunch breaks queuing, just to see what it’s like inside. They all want to have the experience. They all want to feel that they look good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ffbb7c8e4140fdbd9f60d1726cfbdca398318bf/688_819_6507_3904/master/6507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e3f68cbb878054fbc4df9fe874abbc2","title":"chris packham i dont look for conflict but i wont shy away","story":"The naturalist, 58, talks about death threats, autism, miniature poodles, his partner’s tigers and his failure as a conservationistMy earliest memories all relate to animals: tadpoles, ladybirds, lizards, my pet mouse. I can remember being about four, growing up in suburban Southampton, and being fascinated by the difference between me and them. I saw perfection in all of those inidual organisms. Much later I realised that the greater beauty was the way that they live together in an interconnected ecosystem – the fact that it was functional, dynamic and sustainable.My relationship with dogs – I’m not afraid to say it – borders on a dependency. They are my autism-assistant animals. Their unconditional love, dynamism and exuberance has brought me so much joy. I’ve always had black miniature poodles. I called the previous two, Itchy and Scratchy. Now I’ve got Sid and Nancy. My joy grenades. Every time I took them out, I’d pull out the pin by releasing their lead. And sometimes I could just laugh or cry with happiness watching them run. Itchy, Scratchy and I were a very powerful triangular relationship.My partner Charlotte understands my canine devotion because she has a similar relationship with her tigers. She inherited a zoo from her father, so we’re reluctant zoo owners, although it’s more of a rescue sanctuary. Charlotte lives on the Isle of Wight, where the zoo is based, and I live in the New Forest, so we never cohabit. We spend as much time together as we can.When I die, my ashes will be scattered in the New Forest with Itchy and Scratchy’s. I see it as a romantic ambition and not a morbid or unusual one. Whoever’s responsible will have to mix my ashes with theirs and scatter them in the woods where we shared so much love. I’m not somebody who entertains any aspects of the spiritual, but I just like the idea of our carbon molecules being mixed together, growing into a tree that gets eaten by a caterpillar that, in turn, is eaten by a blue tit, which is eaten by a sparrowhawk – my favourite bird.By my mid-20s I came up with a management plan to deal with who I was. I’d been in very dark and depressed places, and when the Asperger’s diagnosis eventually came I realised there were aspects that were empowering and enabling.I’m a very confrontational person. I don’t look for conflict, but I won’t shy away. And I don’t pick my fights to win them, because winning for me is not giving up. Asperger’s is undeniably a gift, because it makes me more robust.The climate crisis sometimes overpowers our capacity to think that we can make a difference. There’s a misconception that to get to carbon-zero, we’re going to have to live in caves and eat cabbage. But we do have an enormous arsenal of abilities we could implement. Our job at the moment is triage, so there’s enough of the planet left that when we get it into the operating theatre we can nurse it back to life.It’s not that I don’t care about death threats, or getting shit posted through my letter box… I’m just impervious. In my world there’s no grey – it’s black or it’s white. So if something is wrong – and there’s no ambiguity about illegally killing birds of prey, which is wrong for ethical, ecological and legal reasons – then I don’t have to hold back. My friend Billy Bragg said to me, “If you’re not getting flak, you’re not over the target,” so I’m reassured when the shit turns up in the post. It means I’m putting pressure on the right people at the right time. Frankly, if they’ve got no other arguments than to post shit, that’s a clear indication that I’m winning.The first line of my obituary will be: “This old punk rocker never failed to shout above the noise.”Chris Packham is raising awareness of the #missingpiece to promote energy efficiency and smart meters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ee5fa559860e540d6cd9289a3a4303ccac05e67/0_347_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6422dc127dfaf6a4d3ca495b821f7b27","title":"i have a happy family but cant stop thinking about my first love","story":"You’ve mired yourself in a fairytale of nostalgia and yearning, says Mariella Frostrup. It’s time to get real…The dilemma I’m a married man in my mid-40s with two deeply loved children. Nine months ago I found and reread some old letters from my first love. I cried my eyes out and ever since she’s been in my thoughts day and night. For 15 years I have buried my feelings for her, yet the release valve has been opened and I am unable to shut it off. At the time she was married to a cheating husband who had supported her through some horrific experiences when she was younger – and I was emotionally insecure and unstable. Yet we came together and my relationship with her remains the most beautiful and profound experience of my life. It ended because we both gave in to fear – mine of attachment and hers of letting go of the security of a (broken) marriage. We have had no contact since.While I’ve always had a strong and loving relationship with my wife, in my heart of hearts it’s never quite felt the same. My ex-love subsequently orced, remarried and now also has children. Sometimes I indulge in wild fantasies that one day, after the kids are grown up, I would get in touch and we could finally be together. What should I do?Mariella replies You’ve got two kids you love deeply and a strong and loving relationship with your wife, both of which are under threat because of a past relationship that didn’t work out. Maybe I should cut off here and make this the shortest column I’ve ever written but, no, let’s carry on and see where it takes us.I used to think the reason I had an aptitude for dilemmas such as yours was because my own life has been liberally scattered with problems. Recently, I had a Damascene revelation – it’s not my own life events that guide me, but the diet of fiction that comes with my other day-job, talking about books on Radio 4. I was reading a passage from Graham Greene last week in which he described the euphoria he felt when he discovered he could read how huge the world felt and how endless the possibilities. Not only have I come round to his way of thinking, but I’d say that novels have given me both an appetite for stories and the ability to guess where they might end up. So you’ve definitely written to the right person.Of course, the ending of any tale also depends on the bravery and ambition of the writer. If you want to inhabit a romcom and give readers the answers they want, I’d say there’s every chance of reigniting this first love. It would occur entirely by chance at a reunion you didn’t want to attend and, after breaking a few hearts along the way (especially your children’s), conclude with you setting off into your twilight years, hand in hand.That is just one possibility, but my taste-buds are tickled by the wider, less trammelled paths this story could take. I see you lingering by her front gate, having tracked her down, and looking longingly into the light-filled kitchen where she’s making supper for her teenagers. She’s laughing and not only is she as beautiful as you remember, but perhaps even more so thanks to how happy and fulfilled she is. That storyline, I’m afraid, ends up with you slinking into the shadows feeling foolish for believing that she, too, was waiting for you.My next foray into the realms of make-believe brings a chance misfortune (near-death experience, illness, unfaithful wife, drug-addicted child, etc) threatening the life you’ve made. In that awful instance you perceive how rewarding the life you already have is and how foolhardy you would have been to sacrifice it for what was, after all, not an unrequited relationship but an unsuccessful one.Or here’s another potential story strand: the choice you make to pursue this union wreaks havoc in your family, bringing emotional turmoil and long-term damage to those you love most. While at first it seems worth it, soon all those nights spent reminiscing about the good old days start to lose their allure and you begin hankering for your old existence.The bottom line is that although I can see many eventualities, none of them comes with a guarantee of elevated happiness and most ring a far more cautionary note. You may be looking for a more inventive answer, but you have to admit yours is not the most original story – the middle-aged man, tied down by family life, looking to restart his engines by harking back to when they ran at their most powerful. To be brutal, this woman has gone on to orce and remarry, so it seems optimistic to imagine she’s got a third round in her – particularly when it initially requires you to become the sort of cheating husband she started out with. But, as we both know, this is not her story. The nostalgia, the yearning and the desire to tread old ground flowed from Pandora’s box the moment you opened those letters. It’s a lid you may want to try to slam shut. I’m certainly struggling to conjure a happy ending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d986034ef308ba68dba691bf099bd03e8ab43d0/0_81_5592_3355/master/5592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b289a5d8a7f9528f71f2165fa0e2ffac","title":"librarian saved my life thank you","story":"In this series writers celebrate a person who changed their lives. Kerry Hudson remembers the librarian who was always a kind, constant, gentle presenceI don’t know if you’ll remember me. Perhaps not, I must be one of so many, old and young, who found sanctuary in your tiny, chapel-like, library at the foot of what was ambitiously called a high street in Hetton-le-Hole, a Northumbrian mining village where all the mining jobs had been taken away.I don’t remember your face as clearly as I would wish, but I do remember how you looked at me, and actually saw me. I was nine years old and standing at your desk asking not just for a book but for a way out, a path forward, for hope and an introduction to the bright future I might have if I only held on, if I didn’t give up. I remember you smiled at me warmly, or maybe you didn’t because it was the end of the day and you were tired, but it never really mattered because, with you, I just knew I was safe.You were always there a constant. A kind, supportive adult in times when I had few of those, who, if I asked you a question, would do your best to answer with kindness, patience and honesty. And when I was overwhelmed and confused because life seemed harsher than I’d imagined it could be, I would go to you and our brief interaction – one person being gentle to another, sharing a love of books that felt bigger than that small village with its big problems – would keep me going a bit longer.I don’t know how to thank you, but I’ll try. Thank you for saving my life before I knew it needed saving. Thank you for understanding that books can be like medicine and therapy, and while they can’t transport you to a calmer home, they can make that home much more bearable. Thank you for knowing, too, that sometimes people haven’t come for the books at all.Now I am grown-up I know how hard you must have worked, how much more you deserved to be paid. I understand that, if you’re still a librarian – I hope you are – your job has become so much more: that you’ll be helping people access the services they need, to apply for jobs and benefits help students and new mums and the elderly to stay connected. You will have become a carer, social worker, tutor and youth worker, as well as a librarian. How lucky I was to have you. Please know that even as services are eroded and funding is gouged, because a library’s value has been reduced to mere footfall, that you forged the way for so many of us and we remember, we are grateful and we will fight for you and your colleagues.For the little girl I was and for all the others like me for whom you provided a hope, a book, a promise of a future and kind words when they were needed, thank you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459f86d81ec2cf7791072b42ef9a8e4296a5049c/0_687_4084_2450/master/4084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e839392d878d39c8a52e766df8bd2b66","title":"trends of the decade that weve had enough of","story":"Whether it’s wellness and healing crystals or the constant sipping of water, there are some fads that we’ve had our fill of.

House plants have become placeholders for our more unwieldy ambitions of love, care and success, their yellowing tendrils manifestations of our inability to just, just be cool. Much as it pains me, the time has come to let plants be plants again. To release them from the agony of being our pets, our parents, our friends, our miscarriages, to remove these layers of expectation and simply allow them to lean towards the light.Wellness: Enough. Enough now, wellness, you’ve had your fun. We have humoured you for long enough, nodding along as you repeated your made-up words at double-speed, while sniffing a lot in between trips to the loo. Sure, you had your moments. That juice was lovely. And I can’t say I didn’t levitate a little with superiority as I tucked into a bowl of lightly oiled courgetti. Yes, these leggings are fine, and lavender smells nice, and certain crystals sparkle beautifully in a bathroom, but not only have most of your claims been loudly debunked, and the vast sums of cash chucked at your feet by vulnerable women been questioned, along with the ethics of spreading unsubstantiated witchcraft in the guise of medical fact, but people have died following your advice. Died. Read the room.Talking about mental health: Over the past five years, mental health awareness has been promoted and commodified to the point where it appears to have looped back around and eaten its own tail. The point has been swallowed the focus of the conversation has shifted from its initial aim – to improve the mental health of a country in distress – to the talk itself. Talking which increasingly seems to serve only the privileged talker, rather than the millions of listeners, who, if they gather the courage to call their GPs, will find themselves on a year-long waiting list. Who, if they enter the system will find themselves sent home on a sea of cuts. Who, if they speak out publicly about historical abuse will find themselves jobless, retraumatised, an object of suspicion. What a cruel trick. Talk gets cheaper every year.Detoxing from tech: A yurt in Wales you say, where the nearest phone signal is 14 miles away, with a single sheepskin rug to sit on as I read “a novel” by candlelight? £1,000 you say? Here, take two! As if the concept of detoxing one’s body wasn’t foul enough, the internet has created a whole new industry to detox the mind, appealing to adults worried that their excellent wifi connection has broken their connection with the real world. They will solemnly purchase new phones that do nothing, download apps to protect their creativities, compose lofty out-of-office replies explaining they will only be checking emails between 3pm and 5pm on a Tuesday. Luckily, as friends tire of their proselytism and stop messaging them, their detox will become far easier.Hydration: As I type, a million people are reaching for a plastic teat from which they can suckle contentedly. It started with the news that we all needed to drink at least five litres of water a day. A quantity which, when we first heard about it, seemed a lot. Too much, some whispered, but OK, death is bad. Then, more news – the world was ending, because every morning we were dutifully buying five plastic bottles of Evian before chucking them in the bin on the way back from our 18th wee. And so, the advent of the reusable drinking bottle, in aluminium, plastic or glass. As well as becoming a snazzy lifestyle item, it has evolved into a transitional object, transforming grown men into hungry babies, latching on hourly. Brrrr.Wild swimming: You will have heard by now that jumping into icy water, preferably within view of some trees, will cure your ills. Headache, depression, oily skin, sad hair, itchy scrotum, gout – popping on a little hat and leaping into a pond will make you all better. Or will it? Yes, your head might feel better, but on the other hand, there are the many obscenities, of lowering yourself into water a fish dismisses as too cold and slimy, a torture recognised by Guantanamo, of getting up pre-dawn, and then, after the Lycra-d plunge, desperately trying to warm up barefoot in the sludge of a renowned dogging location. Babe, it doesn’t add up. My additional question is, do you still feel the benefit if you don’t post it on social media? The endless scroll: Please, thumb, please stop. Please freeze on this screen of potential Netflix films with strong female leads, please pause between Instagram images of kitchens and cats, please cease the horror-scroll down down into the wet depths of Twitter users’ opinions.

As Brexit dominated the political agenda, there appeared to be little time for anything else from the government.But will 2020 be any different, and will promises in the Queen’s speech that there will be an end to no-fault evictions, and no rises in VAT, income tax and national insurance, be borne out?Here is our guide to what to look out for next year when preparing your 2020 budget.Some things will remain the same every year and the deadline for tax returns is one of them. The last day for online returns for the 2018-19 tax year is still 31 January. Failing to file your return or not paying what you owe on time will result in penalty fees and interest charges. But still people fail to pay on time, sometimes with excuses which may not be born in truth – “my mother-in-law is a witch and put a curse on me” and “I’m too short to reach the postbox” among them. So get the job out of the way as soon as possible, ensure that you are taking advantage of all of the tax reliefs that are available, such as for expenses – and also ensure that you declare all of your income.While 2019 was the year that Brexit dominated the political agenda, it was in British holidaymakers’ pockets that its effect was truly felt. The pound has plummeted against both the euro and the dollar since 2016. While there may have been some rises after the Conservative election victory, they were soon followed by declines when new Brexit plans were announced. And these ups and downs don’t hide the fact that winter holidays on the French slopes and the annual summer break in Spain have got a lot more expensive for households. So how to make the most out of weak sterling? Transfer your money in advance, getting the best rates online using comparison engines such as that run by MoneySavingExpert, and avoid at all cost changing money when you are in the airport. Avoid ATM charges by using a card which does not charge for foreign exchange fees or other charges when withdrawing money abroad, such as Starling or Monzo (within a £200 limit outside the European Economic Area).The excesses of Christmas spending are too often followed by credit card debt to be dealt with in January. A quiet month for many, it is a good time to take stock of how you spend and how you can make your money work better for you.The first rule of credit card debt is to try to pay more than the minimum amount and act sooner rather than later if you feel things are getting on top of you. Organisations such as National Debtline, Citizens Advice, the Debt Advice Foundation, StepChange and PayPlan are all available to help if things do get out of control.Managing your mobile is made a lot simpler by splitting the cost of your coverage and the actual price of the phone. Bundled deals, where the phone and the plan come together, typically result in consumers paying more as they are essentially taking out a loan to pay for the handset. Using an interest-free credit card to buy the phone is a better idea, and then couple that with a sim-only deal. Ofcom, the communications regulator, has called for mobile companies to be banned from selling locked handsets, which cannot be used with other sim cards unless they are unlocked – a significant reason among many for not switching their mobile deal. Those looking for better deals on their contract should especially focus on the Easter period, when operators have been known to offer good value.It is widely expected that the chancellor will unveil a budget in February focused on non-Brexit-related matters. It is anticipated that election pledges such as funding 50,000 more nurses for the NHS and increasing the national insurance payment threshold will form some of the key announcements. There has been pressure on the Conservatives to set out plans for social care, for which they have pledged to allocate an additional £1bn a year. In the Queen’s speech, there were commitments not to raise the rate of VAT or income tax, while a renter’s reform bill offers to give tenants more security by removing “no-fault” evictions.The energy price cap, which came into effect at the beginning of this year, will be reviewed in April. The price cap is for those who are on the standard variable tariff, the most basic packages offered by the energy companies. The cap limits the price a supplier can charge per kilowatt hour of electricity and gas used. It serves as a timely reminder that householders should always look around for a better deal, as they can typically save by switching their energy supplier. Under the current price cap, a home which uses a typical amount of energy on a standard tariff pays £1,179 a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56b6da52486e2db21fc97fab2c5c2338062db61a/0_1_2560_1537/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e203e560d2c300af43ec6a089d3502f0","title":"fiona maddocks best classical music of 2019","story":"From Martinů to Mazzoli it was a vintage year for opera great and small, and inspired programming everywhere. And in troubled times, a happy ending…Plenty of outstanding music around the UK this year distracted us from woes about the planet and Brexit, but a deafening cry of #MeToo added a note of dissonance. Conservatoires and specialist music schools have come under scrutiny. Iniduals at every level have been reprimanded, including top opera stars, starting – amid great upset – with the veteran tenor-turned-baritone Plácido Domingo. His long and glorious career is over in the States, but European houses still welcome him, wanting more proof to substantiate allegations. He is still due to sing at the Royal Opera House in 2020, where the 42-year-old Italian star tenor Vittorio Grigolo has been suspended following an incident on tour with the company in Japan. This is an unfolding story of endemic sexual abuse across the industry, and how to establish a way forward.Artistically, the Royal Opera has had a gilded year, with a string of triumphs: Káťa Kabanová, Agrippina, Death in Venice among them. So too have our regional companies: Welsh National Opera’s ambitious Freedom season provoked thought. Opera North reminded us of the contemporary relevance and power of Martinů’s The Greek Passion. Scottish Opera gave us stimulating new works: Stuart MacRae’s Anthropocene and Missy Mazzoli’s Breaking the Waves. English Touring Opera, doing sterling work on the tightest budget, encouraged singers from around the country to join them in Kurt Weill’s The Silver Lake, paired with deft and lively Mozart (The Seraglio). English National Opera raised hopes for the future with the appointment of Annilese Miskimmon as artistic director.Companies away from the mainstream continue to make inroads: east London’s Grimeborn festival, based at the Arcola theatre, had a bumper season. Shadwell Opera made a mark with Eight Songs for a Mad King. The Manchester Collective showed how streamlined musicians can bring adventure to concert life. Kings Place has been doing that all year with Venus Unwrapped, making women composers the focus. Aurora Orchestra, fearless and versatile, continues to amaze. The UK leads the way with offbeat musical adventure. It doesn’t have to be in a car park or bunker. Wigmore Hall boasts plenty of quiet subversion too.The major UK orchestras are preparing for changes at the top: Vasily Petrenko, popular principal conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, announced he would move to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. At the Southbank, Esa-Pekka Salonen, stepping down at the Philharmonia, will be succeeded by the young Finn, Santtu-Matias Rouvali. Vladimir Jurowski’s successor at the London Philharmonic is Edward Gardner. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra have snaffled the exciting young Russian conductor and harpsichordist Maxim Emelyanychev. Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra won particular recognition for its work with disabled musicians through its Change Makers and Resound programmes. The Barbican embraced the world, from Chineke! to the LA Phil. And the BBC Symphony Orchestra introduced us to the vigorous, chilling power of William Alwyn’s Miss Julie, superbly performed by all. Time for a full staging.In a strong year for books on music, Oliver Soden’s generous, game-changing biography of Michael Tippett topped the list. John Bridcut’s TV film about Dame Janet Baker was beautiful and touching (and returns to BBC Four tomorrow). Many important musical figures left us: the conductor Mariss Jansons, the soprano Jessye Norman, the Kings College, Cambridge choral director Stephen Cleobury, the baroque pioneer Raymond Leppard, the pianist Márta Kurtág, the composer Giya Kancheli. The 90-year-old Bernard Haitink retired from conducting, still full of life. The best news story of the year?

She wants at minimum to be moved from solitary confinement.She has been held in solitary since October 2018. Just before Christmas she wrote to the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, pleading for ministers to do more to secure her release.A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, Abbas Mousavi, rejected the flurry of publicity over her case and said Iran would not submit to political games or propaganda.The British-Iranian Zaghari-Ratcliffe and many other imprisoned dual nationals in Tehran believe they are being held as political hostages. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has already undertaken one hunger strike in solidarity with Moore-Gilbert and has said she will start another before New Year’s Eve. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed four years ago.A third dual national, Fariba Adelkhah, a French-Iranian academic, is also on hunger strike. The French government has summoned the Iranian ambassador over her detention.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said of Moore-Gilbert’s plight: “Five days on dry hunger strike is becoming critical, and our thoughts go out to Kylie and her family for all this ordeal.“She was already being taken to the health clinic after 48 hours. By now I would expect Kylieand Fariba to be there almost permanently. If it continues as planned they only have days.“It gives some sense of just how desperate 16 months in solitary makes you. At some point you really feel you have nothing left to get noticed, nothing left to lose.“I hope the Australian and British governments also step up today and shake off the complacency of their holiday heads. It is one thing for the Iranian regime to hold innocent people hostage, it is quite another to let them die.”In her latest letter to the Australian government, Moore-Gilbert said: “Over the past nine months I have been completely banned from any contact with my family, with the exception of a three-minute phone call (all with my father), which was only granted after I took desperate measures which put my own life at risk.“I have undertaken five hunger strikes as my only means to raise my voice, but to no avail. As predicted, I have now received a conviction of 10 years in prison, and my appeal court has failed.”She urged the Australian ministers to review what they had been doing to secure her release.The Iranian government says both academics were found guilty of espionage and that any interference by foreign governments will not help their case.Mousavi said: “The statement by France’s foreign ministry regarding an Iranian national is an act of interference and we see their request to have no legal basis.He said her lawyer had knowledge about the details of the case, which was being investigated.Iran does not recognise dual nationality and has repeatedly rebuffed calls from foreign governments for consular access to those it has detained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32573a29faa9ce05d1e3aea4130aa850a1bd75a4/0_43_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b62635d5e42fdf7cc780ce9c1230c2","title":"abandoned at sea the cargo crew adrift without wages fuel or supplies a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

In a letter to the Observer, they say the issue of antisemitism was “constantly relayed back to us on the doorstep”.The intervention will be seen as an attempt by figures on the centre and right of the party not to allow Labour’s poor performance to be underplayed. It comes amid concerns about a party review of its performance that includes the former Labour leader Ed Miliband. Some in the party fear the review, led by the independent Labour Together group, will struggle to give a frank assessment of what went wrong.Among the signatories to the letter are Mary Creagh, who lost her Wakefield seat, Emma Reynolds, who lost her Wolverhampton North East seat, Anna Turley, who was unseated in Redcar, and Phil Wilson, who lost his Sedgefield seat.“The scale of this defeat means we have to look unflinchingly at what went wrong, way beyond a simple review, welcome as that might be,” they write. “We need to be honest about why our outgoing leadership’s reflexive anti-western world view was so unpopular, and address the reasons for that unpopularity. We were rejected on doorsteps not just because of our woolly, changing position on Brexit, or in Scotland, because of our weak commitment to the union, but because the very people we were supposed to be fighting for did not think the policies in our manifesto related to their lives.”They add: “The focus on nationalisation and uncontrolled spending commitments meant people simply didn’t believe us. Sadly, this was particularly true with those most affected by the poverty and injustice that 10 years of Tory government has created.“Lastly, the cronyism at the top of our party and repeated unwillingness to stand up to the stain of antisemitism was constantly relayed back to us on the doorstep, shaming the traditional values of our once great anti-racist party.“It is our duty to speak up now, so that our party leadership candidates keep these people at the heart of their campaigns to lead our party. The challenge for the eventual winner is immense. We need to win 150 seats in every corner of the country, gaining votes from a coalition of communities. Labour needs to be in government – and for that, fundamental change at the top of our party is required. Only this will help us recover from the catastrophic loss.”The letter comes with the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn still unclear, with only the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and the frontbencher Clive Lewis declaring their intention to run. The date of the election has not yet been set.Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, who had been widely seen as the favoured candidate of the party’s powerful left, is still regarded as a likely candidate, but has not yet set out her position since Labour’s election loss. Party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery is also keeping his options open, suggesting that the party’s left has not yet settled on a single candidate. Other likely candidates include Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, and backbenchers Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/261d92ab872164ec32880a8e5a1dbe795bd0a63f/0_15_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bcfa1cfbd19c1b9e631463f028c56e6","title":"charity assisting retail workers sees 30 rise in requests for help","story":"The Fashion and Textile Children’s Trust steps in to assist children whose parents work in the fashion industry but are struggling to make ends meet.

Sarah ButlerPangbourne said the expense of Christmas added to already high levels of stress and anxiety: “We are seeing families approach us for help to replace broken items in the home, such as washing machines or beds. It’s likely these families have been making do, or using any spare wages to save for replacements, but the shock of redundancy has given them no other option.”The trust, which was founded in 1853 by a group of philanthropic textile merchants to support the bereaved family of a colleague, helped 615 families in its last financial year. Its average grant is around £500, and the charity said it was possible recent store closures will lead to an increase in the number of grants awarded.The work of the charity, originally called the Purley Children’s Trust, attracted the attention of Dickens, who chaired its appeal board from 1856 to 1857."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/455d1eff0696f9295771fa46aea3872902579727/0_440_4551_2728/master/4551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2983ad5bc3435f45acb4b0e8465af8b3","title":"my year of sobriety jack monroe","story":"Gone are the dreadful hangovers, regrets and shame that went hand in glove with addiction, replaced after 12 months with a rekindled love of life, family and friendsOn 27 December 2018, at 4 o’clock in the morning, I shifted uncomfortably on my small sofa in the freezing cold living room of my messy rented bungalow. I’d passed out mid-bingeing on Richard Curtis films and whisky an hour or so before. My shoulders screamed in agony, my mouth was dry and gasping, my head was pounding. I put my feet on the floor and faceplanted the carpet, so shuffled to the bathroom on my stomach, falling asleep again on the linoleum floor, clutching the toilet bowl.Alcoholism had crept up on me, disguised as a friend to ease the social anxieties of newfound minor fame, a lubricant for awkward situations and parties where people I recognised from television peered over my shoulder while making small talk, looking for someone more noteworthy to flit off to chat to. I filled in trauma wounds with ethanol, I became louder, bolder, wearing my booze-soaked persona like armour against impostor syndrome and rooms full of thinner, more beautiful people.I found myself pinned to walls by household-name male journalists, who forced their hands inside my shirt and tongues in my mouth, while telling myself I had asked for it, getting in that state. I lost count of the number of boozy lunches with people I considered peers and colleagues that ended with disquieting gropes in the back of taxis and the niggling feeling that I should really stop allowing myself to be so vulnerable.That morning I lifted my head from the floor and threw up half a dozen times, guilt and grief and self-loathing wracking every trembling, retching pore of my body. I think I have a problem, I slurred to myself as I sank back to the ground, covered in vomit and sweat.I decided, then, that I would go sober. I’d tried before, in secret, tipping all of the household booze down the sink and counting the days on one hand until I slipped up again. So, this time, I decided to let everyone else in on it. Not for glory, but for accountability. If everyone knew, there would be nowhere to hide. Nowhere to hole up and order a sneaky glass of wine or two. No excuses, no yellow cards.I walked into my local shop on 6 January 2019, and the owner called me by my name. “You’re famous!” he laughed, not unkindly, wielding a copy of that day’s Observer at me. There I was, on the front page, declaring myself an alcoholic, for all the world to see. I took a deep breath. “Yes, that’s me. And I don’t want you to serve me alcohol ever again. It doesn’t matter what I say, how much I ask, if I say it’s for someone else, just don’t serve me.”He nodded, understanding. I bought my paper and fled, embarrassed and ashamed. I hadn’t expected it to be so prominent, but it was done now, and there was no going back.I slotted a piece of paper into my passport, with the words “Do not serve me – I am an alcoholic” in block capitals, and carried it everywhere. I used it twice. Both times, I burned with shame as the cashier read it, scanned my face for the moment of realisation and handed it back, sweeping the bottles of booze out of my basket and placing them out of reach behind the counter. “Just go to the meetings, you don’t need to tell everyone you meet that you’re an alcoholic,” my then sponsor sighed at me.I found a new sponsor one with less interest in squeezing my thigh and referring to our meetings as “dates”. I found online meetings, plugged in to women-only groups with recovering alcoholics from around the world from the comfort of my garden chair or burrowed beneath my duvet. The convenience of being dialled into group chats with strangers, avoiding the glances or trying to place where we may have run into each other before, worked for me. And I did need to tell people. Because in my line of work there are always invitations, open bars, long nights and swanky clubs you can slip into if you know the right B-lister and are considered worthy of their company. Coming out publicly was difficult, and damaged some of my friendships and strained some family relationships, but I did it to be held accountable. And for the most part, it worked.When I launched my book Tin Can Cook at a pop-up kitchen in Hackney in the spring, my agent and longtime friend Rosemary brought me a bottle of rose lemonade. My friend and publicist, Jess, turned up with a blend of herbal tea and lemonade she had seen me post about on Instagram.For a friend’s book launch later in the year, her publisher reassured me in the invitation that all of the drinks would be non-alcoholic. At my favourite private hideaway in Soho, the bar staff no longer took my order, but presented me with a double espresso and a large glass of kombucha as soon as I sat down. I owe the greatest debt of gratitude to my partner, Louisa. It’s been a very difficult year in some respects and there have been times where I have sat beside her at a dinner or out with friends, hissing out of the corner of my mouth that I am an adult and if I want a fucking drink I will have one. She has cut short many of her own nights out to come home and hold me, and on the occasions where I have fallen off the wagon, she has picked me up and set me back on my feet, without anger or judgment, just love and concern.I have gained literally hundreds of hours of time over the last year where before I would spend my evenings drunk and my mornings in a fog of headache and nausea, now I go to bed early with crime novels or lengthy world war tomes about double-crossing agents, cold cases, or other similar genres.I made it my mission to “grow up and show up”, having previously had a reputation for being flaky, late and unreliable. I am a better mother for my sobriety – making all of my son’s school plays, assemblies and meetings in the last year. We spend far more quality time together now, and the little boy who was at times anxious, awkward and painfully shy is flourishing under the warmth of genuine maternal attention and time spent doing not much at all. I always feared motherhood growing up in a household where foster children came and went in a revolving door of trauma and disarray, I was continually petrified that I would never be able to be a proper mother to my son.Not a day goes by, yet, where I am not gripped by the desire to drink. Sometimes it is a fleeting temptation, batted away like a pesky mosquito sometimes it is a mania that lasts for hours, hissing and whispering from the darkest parts of myself that oblivion is the safest place to be.I am contacted every day by strangers who want to ask me how I’ve “done it”. People examining their own relationship with alcohol, or finding a spark of recognition in my story. My reply is always the same. First, that in reaching out to someone for help you have made the first step to admitting that you may have a problem and that you are actively considering resolving it, or at least seeking help. Second, alcohol is an absolute demon. It is almost impossible to get through it alone: no matter how resilient or resourceful you may be, find a community and lean on them as much as you need to. And, finally, find something to use as a distraction. For me, I keep a dumbbell in both of the bathrooms in my house. When the demon comes hissing, I take myself off and do 12 biceps curls on each arm. If that doesn’t work, I do 12 more. On the occasions where that doesn’t work either, I text a friend, my partner, or my sponsor, and ask for a quick chat.Much of my alcoholism was rooted in extreme loneliness and I have found that since choosing to be more present, I have made new friendships and nurtured old ones.It’s not easy, going sober. But it is simple. You just don’t pick up a drink, no matter how you justify it to yourself or how bad your day has been. Alcoholism doesn’t confine me any longer, and it doesn’t define me either. You can have the gift of more time, more money, better health and healthier relationships, because a life beyond your wildest dreams and expectations awaits you outside of that bottle, not at the bottom of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9fe31a4781699593d7f3c7a26029ce12aa01a5/109_14_2751_1651/master/2751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb48457404fe5bfe646e5f3ff7f9d6ce","title":"andy murray pulls out australian open","story":"Andy Murray, who has struggled with injury since the Davis Cup finals six weeks ago, has withdrawn from the ATP Cup, due to start in three cities across Australia on Friday, and the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on 20 January.Minor setbacks to his rehab programme and slow recovery from a pelvic problem have dissuaded the former world No 1 from going back on the Tour until February. He will continue practising at home to build up fitness.“I’ve worked so hard to get myself into a situation where I can play at the top level and I’m gutted I’m not going to be able to play in Australia in January,” he said on Saturday night.“After the Australian Open this year, when I wasn’t sure whether I’d be able to play again, I was excited about coming back to Australia and giving my best, and that makes this even more disappointing for me. Unfortunately I’ve had a setback recently and as a precaution, need to work through that before I get back on court competing.”Murray’s withdrawal from the new ATP Cup initially threw into confusion the participation of the Great Britain team, who needed his protected ranking to earn a place in the tournament. Britain’s leading player, Kyle Edmund, who was in excellent form in the Davis Cup finals, did not have a sufficiently high ATP ranking to enable the team to make the list, and has since committed to playing in Qatar and Adelaide.However, it is understood the GB team, who will be based in Sydney, will now seek a replacement for Murray. Great Britain have drawn Bulgaria in their first tie of Group C in the new 24-team format, with Dan Evans, ranked 42nd in the world, to open the tie against the world No 424, Dimitar Kuzmanov. Murray was scheduled to play his old rival Grigor Dimitrov in the night match.Murray had to be persuaded to use his protected ranking when the final details of the ATP Cup were confirmed, so his doubts about his fitness have been in place for a little while. When he chose to spend Christmas at home with his young family rather than commit to his usual winter training block in Miami doubts grew. However, he gave no clear indication until Saturday that he was not fit to travel to Australia.He picked up an elbow injury when winning his first tournament in two and a half years, in Antwerp in October, and stretched his physical resources to the limit in a tough five-setter against the then world No 179 Tallon Griekspoor in the Davis Cup, during which a groin strain flared.Murray’s team hope he can return in February – he has entered Rotterdam and Montpellier – but he has given no guarantees. His withdrawal from the Australian leg of his season is a blow to what was shaping as an encouraging comeback from his second hip operation in January. His movement, speed and stamina were improving steadily and, after winning a doubles tournament at Queen’s in the summer, his confidence was high.Given the physical trauma of surgery and the frustrating stretches he endured after his first hip operation the previous January, Murray can look back on 2019 with satisfaction. He won 11 of 18 matches on the Tour, won titles in singles and doubles, earned $369,000 in ticking-over prize money and had a major documentary, Resurfacing, which went into some detail about his fight to return.However, he has said several times he will not rush his comeback, at the age of 32, in what is clearly the final stage of his long career. Murray hopes to keep playing for as long as he can and his major target in 2020 will be defending his Olympic title in Tokyo.That seems the most realistic route back for Murray to win major honours, given the early matches in the Olympic tournament are the best of three sets. The prospect of enduring a fortnight’s examination of his fitness and form in best‑of‑five matches at the highest level in a grand slam tournament do not look promising.Murray has been more relaxed about his career since coming through the hip problem, which threatened to end his playing days after his first-round lost to Roberto Bautista Agut at the Australian Open 12 months ago. Patience has been a virtue so far he is not about to abandon that and risk a further setback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a242d9fe56ba2ffbd64c115e087d717f4fdf3546/0_84_2608_1565/master/2608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d7b44d67604a66ec5f0c299e8fac347","title":"england south africa day four first test report new ball","story":"To the relief of a nation, whose cricket has been in crisis, South Africa defeated England by 107 runs at Centurion. In fact England did not lose this match on the final day. It was their batting on the second afternoon and their bowling on the third morning that gifted the initiative to the South Africans, who held their nerve and discipline thereafter. The wickets were shared among the South African bowlers but maybe the decisive contribution on a bowler friendly surface came from Quinton de Kock, the highest runscorer in the match.England were severely handicapped by a flu bug rampaging through their ranks during this match, which affected not only their preparations, but also the well-being of some of the players during the game. Even so they will acknowledge that they were woefully inconsistent in certain passages of a contest that was always captivating, given that batting was never a straightforward operation. They need to recover fast physically and mentally before the Cape Town Test on 3rd January.For all their battling England never managed to get their noses in front on the final day. The South Africans remained patient and persistent. On Sunday morning 50 runs were scored for the loss of two wickets, quite a contrast to the 124 conceded by England in the first session on Saturday. Vernon Philander began with a string of maidens and there were just two scoring strokes in the first half hour, both from the bat of Joe Denly, a glide for 4 and a rather magnificent pulled six off Kasigo Rabada.Rory Burns could not rediscover the fluency of the previous evening. His first single was perilous, a push to short leg left him out of his crease and the throw from substitute, Rudi Second, missed the stumps and produced an overthrow. There would not be many more runs for Burns. Perhaps relieved that the drip drip torture when facing Philander had come to an end, Burns attempted to pull the second delivery of the day from Anrich Nortje and could only splice it gently to mid on.Denly played two more eye-catching pull shots but then departed lbw to Dwaine Pretorius as he attempted to drive on the leg side. As is increasingly the case Denly had looked the part, technically sound, temperamentally composed without being able to produce a really significant innings. Mind you, it was not straightforward out there as Root was about to discover. He was hit on the hand and the wrist by lifters from Nortje as England crawled to the interval.The tempo increased in the half-hour after lunch. Keshav Maharaj was summoned and his first over yielded three boundaries as Stokes came out of his shell vis a sweep and a lofted extra cover drive. Thirty runs came in five overs, but then Maharaj struck, which prompted an Imran Tahir-style celebration. The dismissal of Stokes now triggers such a reaction. Stokes had tried to late cut a ball that turned before hitting the stumps via a thin edge. Now the South Africans began to breathe more easily even though Root was still displaying great judgement at the other end.Jonny Bairstow survived until Rabada took the second new ball. He clipped the first delivery from Rabada majestically to the square leg boundary the next was a wide swinging half-volley, which attracted Bairstow’s attention. He sliced it hard but straight into the safe hands of Zubayr Hamza in the gully.England had to resort to Plan B, which, without the window dressing, was to hit and hope. But that did not work terribly well. Curran sliced a couple of boundaries but was loitering on the crease when Rabada pitched up and he was caught behind. Jofra Archer may have an eye for a white ball but not yet a red one in Test cricket he was soon caught at slip. Jos Buttler was stranded and managed a few spectacular shots as game sprinted to its close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30290022a271412bd957dc83105b7a1f6836bdca/0_70_4956_2974/master/4956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fee96f50a18d8e2215cb60b24c4492d","title":"south africa v england tourists need 376 to win first test on day four live","story":"So farewell 2019, a never-uneventful year for cricket in general and English cricket in particular. Even by this country’s quirky standards, some memorable heights have been hit and some 90s-esque depths have been hinted at. And South Africa thoroughly deserve to take a series lead to Cape Town they bowled with more discipline and better plans, they seized what opportunities they had with the bat in conditions that weren’t always easy, and generally did stuff that England failed to do. The first-innings batting was sloppy, and even after a better effort second time around, there was little sense that they’d be able to dig in for an improbable win. The toss choice and team choice still suggest a lack of conviction in strategy and personnel. Both teams are in kind-of new eras though, all of which makes the rest of this series intriguing.And with that, and Vic Marks’s match report below, I’ll wish you the happiest of new years on behalf of all of us in OBO Towers. Thanks for your emails and company. Bye.“Overton and Bess will remain in the squad, on the advice of the medical squad, and they’ll travel to Cape Town with us.”Joe Root speaks: “It’s been a really tough week off the field – 10 guys going down ill, but credit to everyone they’ve stood up, and tried to put in the best performance possible. It’s not been long since we’ve seen similar chases from a similar group of players. We were in a good position at lunch with me and Ben there, and needed to negotiate new ball afterwards. But the game was won and lost with the seven for 39 collapse in the first innings, though good to bounce back and bat better in the second innings.“The toss was a 50-50 call, you get a side 111-5 and you think you’ve got ahead of the game, but credit to them, they played very well. Archer is a huge talent, still at the start of his Test career, and responded well after a difficult tour of New Zealand, where he had a lot thrown at him.Faf du Plessis is up next: “The last couple of months has been tough for us, we’ve worked very hard, this was a good Test, two teams fighting all the way. Today’s effort was incredible, from the start, and the wickets came eventually. It’s the start of a new chapter for us and we want to make sure we’re improving and move up again, it’s going to be a long journey to get there. Philander was phenomenal, day one and two was best for bowlers, yesterday the best day to bat, and even today, was better for batting. We did the basics really well, and kept it tight. Some feedback, inevitably some Bairstow and Foakes chat, inevitably: Maybe we should look at the England wicketkeeper issue like a school exam multipule choice question,” writes Dan Hunt. “Pick one of the following three to bat at No 7 for England in a Test series. Your selection will also keep wicket for the side: A) An experienced professional with a test career of two halves. His early appearances were successful and productive. His later performances offered diminishing returns as the inadvertent price of becoming the world’s best ODI opener.B) An experienced white ball cricketer with a level head on his shoulders and the ability to regular transform limited overs games. His red ball record is minimal but has shown some glimpses of the destructive prowess he so regularly shows in other formats.C) A first class regular although a few years younger than the other other two choices. Widely acknowledged as the best wicketkeeper in England his batting, he has, on his limited international appearances so far has tended to over deliver against expectations. Seems to me like we should be moving on to option C....”Who’ll be man of the match then? De Kock for his catches and decisive first-innings rescue act? Rabada for his seven wickets? Philander for his metronomic precision? Nortje and Petersen also played key roles in what was a fine all-round team effort. England, meanwhile, end 2019 having won only four Tests, one of which was a dead rubber, another being an almost-dead one, and one of the others being one of the greatest things that has ever happened in any sporting arena ever. Typical England.The South African players are high-fiving each other gleefully here, and why not: this win brings some much-needed feelgood glow to South African cricket after a pretty horrendous 2019, on and off the pitch. Graeme Smith, Mark Boucher and co might contribute to that, after a fine first Test overseeing things. And they’ve been on top of England ever since that second-afternoon collapse. It was a poor decision to bowl first, but their lack of all-round longevity as a Test batting unit makes them hard to rely on whatever the circumstances.93rd over: England 268 (Anderson 0), target 376 Buttler has only one option now – hit, and hit hard, which he does to spectacular effect off the first ball of Rabada’s over, belting it high over long-on and into the grass banks for SIX, but it doesn’t last because he’s caught in the deep next ball. Broad hoiks the next, shortish ball for two to get off the mark, and promptly inside-edges for another couple. England aren’t going to die wondering anyway, as Broad then spoons up another chance that just eludes a ing Maharaj on the offside, before he’s clean bowled to clean up the matchButtler has decided an attacking frenzy is the only route to a miracle, and clouts the first ball of Rabada’s over for six, but perishes trying the same thing next ball, skying up in the air for Pretorius to take a steepler at long-on.92nd over: England 256-8 (Buttler 16, Broad 0), target 376 Archer expresses his confidence in Archer by running a single off the first ball of Nortje’s over. But it’s not repaid as the No 9 is done for pace and can only edge to slip. Nortje has three wickets, and deservedly so – his introduction has turned this game decisively in South Africa’s direction, though it was inching that way in any case. Four wickets with the new ball have removed all doubt.Archer flicks a too-quick delivery to first slip, where Van der Dussen this time takes the catch.91st over: England 255-7 Buttler 15, Archer 4), target 376 Curran offers a hint of what he and Buttler’s victory strategy would have been if he hadn’t edged behind a delivery after slashing Rabada over backward point for four off the first ball of the over. Archer, much-maligned as a batsman and by some even as a bowler of late, is off the mark with a four first ball. So have that.Curran is done like a kipper by one that’s slanted across then straightens, takes his edge, and that’s him gone. Along with the game.90th over: England 247-6 Buttler 15, Curran 5), target 376 Because he’s the sort of cricketer he is, Sam Curran flays and edges Nortje – and it flashes through the third slip area for four. Buttler then ups the ante and plays the second classy off-drive for four of his innings, though he’s then almost caught at short leg next ball but the fielder can’t quite scramble there in time. No matter, because the next ball is casually swung for SIX – in the way only Buttler can – over the square leg boundary.89th over: England 232-6 Buttler 5, Curran 0), target 376 Buttler flicks at a wide one from Rabada down leg – it brushes his pads but a ing De Kock can only parry it. He’s then bothered by one that jags right back into his left thigh, off both seam and pitch-crack. England aren’t going to survive this.Has any cricketer been discussed in a match he’s not playing in more than Ben Foakes has here? Here’s some more on that subject from Neil Brock:“By the end of this tour with South Africa I get the feeling Ben Foakes stock will never be higher. Bairstow is under huge pressure to score and massively out of form whilst Buttler still appears shoehorned in to make up for the failings of the rest of England’s batting line-up. Despite Foakes only averaging 26 at County level last season his glovework and the fact he hasn’t failed internationally mean his name will keep coming up. Even with the circumstances around it, Pope having to keep wicket against New Zealand was a bit of a travesty and one which falls on the selectors making another short-sighted decision. At least I hope Foakes has enjoyed having his feet up over Christmas!”88th over: England 232-6 Buttler 5, Curran 0), target 376 Nortje replaces Philander, and Du Plessis’ bowling change is swiftly vindicated by Root’s dismissal, his one slightly loose shot of the session, his footwork static, though it was just the sort of ball that tempts even the finest of batsmen. Nortje comes round the wicket at the new man in, the left-handed Curran, making him play and completing a wicket maiden.“As a dyed in the wool tyke,” writes Nick Smith (is there any other type?), “I feel obliged to defend YJB somewhat - during his and Buttler’s 100-odd tests, how often have they come in after the openers have yet again failed?” Yeah, like I said, the whole Test strategy and team has been confused.Nortje comes on and strikes second ball of his spell, just as Rabada did a few overs back, and it’s a big one, a perfectly pitched out-nibbler in the corridor that the England captain edges behind. That should be South Africa’s Test now.87th over: England 232-5 (Root 48, Buttler 5), target 376 Root cuts loose, literally, top-handing past backward point for four, again benefiting from playing late. He’s able to flick a single to leg too as batting begins to look a little easier. If these two can get to tea unscathed then … nah, forget it, I’m not going there. In a random development, a couple of England fans appear to be singing Sheffield United’s “greasy chip butty” song86th over: England 227-5 (Root 43, Buttler 5), target 376 A short extra-cover is brought in for Buttler, but he’s able to see out the over, judiciously leaving well at this point, and Philander’s swing too easy to pick to be tempted by. And it’s rounded off with a sumptuous, coaching-manual cover drive for four.85th over: England 223-5 (Root 43, Buttler 1), target 376 Some more variable bounce from Rabada, including the first proper bouncer with the new ball, which Root gets under comfortably enough. He’s doing the right things here, the England captain, seeing the ball late onto the bat, and judging his lines and lengths well, until the last ball of the over, which zips past him at pace and low bounce and is too close for him to cut. Rabada the better of the two opening bowlers at this point.84th over: England 223-5 (Root 43, Buttler 1), target 376 Philander doesn’t make Buttler play enough in this over, granting the batsman some handy leaving practice. Another maiden.Their presence is more a reflection of England’s confused strategy towards Test cricket for the past four years, and a lack of an obvious first-choice red-ball XI during that time. Moeen’s loss of form feels a big part of this.83rd over: England 223-5 (Root 43, Buttler 1), target 376 Rabada is discomforting England here, though Buttler manages to squeeze a single to get himself off the mark. Root, at least, is batting sensibly though, getting himself out of the way of the trickiest stuff.The Bairstow chat begins: “I count myself a huge admirer of Jonny,” enumerates Tim Sanders, “and I thought it was a fair call to drop him for Tests with the requirement to rediscover his technique for first-class cricket. What then seemed daft was to recall him as soon as someone else got ill or injured. If the judgement is that he has work to do, then how does another player’s fitness change that?” He’s certainly now at that stage of his Test career where every failure will be considered damning rather than an aberration. He’s not looked Test-standard here, certainly.82nd over: England 222-5 (Root 43, Buttler 0), target 376 Philander returns from the Pavilion End. He’s into that perfect offside-corridor groove straight away, and has Root driving and missing with a teasing away swinger. This could be a hell of a contest. A maiden.81st over: England 222-5 (Root 43, Buttler 0), target 376 Rabada takes the new ball and his first delivery is overpitched, and Bairstow cashes in joyously, flicking through midwicket for four. But the joy doesn’t last, and YJB goes next ball – he has failed again, and at a pivotal time. Buttler is well beaten with an excellent couple of inswingers first up. This is a massive innings for him too, now, and he’s had a proper working over already with his first four deliveries faced.Given how England fell away at five down in the first innings, South Africa are emphatic favourites now.Rabada strikes with the second ball with the new nut! Bairstow had clipped the first for four but then edges a tempting wide away-swinger to third slip, where Hamza takes a good sharp catch on the rise.80th over: England 218-4 (Root 43, Bairstow 5), target 376 Pretorius doesn’t look particularly threatening at this point, and Root flicks him away for two towards square leg, before Root is well beaten and struck on the pad with the final ball with the old ball, but it’s outside the line, and Du Plessis declines the review. There’s no inside edge either, invalidating gully’s attempt to claim the catch, which bounced just before him in any case. Now is the decisive time. New ball up next.79th over: England 216-4 (Root 41, Bairstow 5), target 376 Root eases Maharaj away for a single at the start of the spinner’s final over before the new ball is due. He has a silly point in for Bairstow, who is necessarily watchful against some accurate bowling, however much his instincts might want him to clout him over the top.78th over: England 215-4 (Root 40, Bairstow 5), target 376 Bairstow gets to face the seamers for the first time, coping comfortably with what Pretorius has to offer but without scoring. Some South Africa team news: Aiden Markram’s self-inflicted hand injury (how many more times must cricketers be told that a man can’t win a fight with a locker) means the uncapped Keegan Petersen has been called into their squad for the second Test.77th over: England 215-4 (Root 40, Bairstow 5), target 376 Another so-so over from Maharaj brings two singles. Meanwhile Abhijato Sensarma has a seasonal rhyme for us, which may or may not jinx things, depending on your affiliations:No jokes, Ben Stokes was the biggest of England’s hopesThe spinner has tried to be the dream killer and make them hang onto their last ropes’Once a year is enough’ - the Proteas must be musing about their Durban chokeBut England have an affinity for tragedy as well as comedy, that’s no jokeThe new batsman should be nowhere near the Test side, but here he is instead of Ollie PopeCriticism, omission and straight balls are things with which he cannot copeBut the man also has a point to prove like his skipper, so naysayers - lie lowIf there’s an unlikely Christmas hero the world deserves, it’s Jonny Bairstow76th over: England 213-4 (Root 39, Bairstow 4), target 376 Pretorius comes on for Nortje, but can’t find the same venom as his predecessor from that end, though he does have a shout for lbw against Root, shuffling across his stump, but it still looks to be going down leg, and too high, and the umpires are rightly haveing none of it.75th over: England 212-4 (Root 39, Bairstow 4), target 376 Bairstow is gifted another Maharaj loosener from which to get off the mark, and the cut is emphatic and bound for the ropes. An easy four. There’s plenty in the pitch for the spinner, as you’d expect at this stage of the game, but he’s not quite found the control needed. Yet he’s still changed the mood with a key wicket, and deserves to continue until the new ball.74th over: England 208-4 (Root 39, Bairstow 0), target 376 South Africa’s dander is suddenly up, and Root’s mood is scarcely improved by, first, a grubber that he can get nowhere near from Nortje second, another that spits off the surface and straight into his sensitive regions, and third a more orthodox away-swinger that beats him all ends up. But he survives them, and then flicks a stray ball down legside backward of square which beats the man on the boundary to bring four more. A tremendous over of Test match cricket, that.73rd over: England 204-4 (Root 35, Bairstow 0), target 376 I’d just typed that Maharaj isn’t on top of things at all yet, after another short and loose one was worked away easily by Root for a single, before he only goes and bowls Stokes with one that turns in sharply at the left-hander. That’ll learn me for banging on about Headingley and Perera. So now, let the YJB arguments begin! Which is what we’re all here for after all.Maharaj brings one back into Stokes, who drags it onto his stumps. That came from nowhere.72nd over: England 203-3 (Root 34, Stokes 14), target 376 Just as England may be buoyed by talk of Headingley as they go after this large target, you wonder if South Africa are haunted by their own fourth-innings nightmare this year, at the hands of Kusal Perera. Stokes flicks Nortje away for a well-run two and sees out the rest of the over comfortably enough.71st over: England 201-3 (Root 34, Stokes 12), target 376 Philander is dragged from that end, and replaced by Maharaj as Du Plessis seeks some spin magic with the old ball. Stokes is after him from the off though, sweeping his first ball to the square leg boundary for four and clouting the fourth through the covers for another boundary. The first real sign of cutting loose from the newly gonged all-rounder. Root rounds off a highly productive over with an effortless cut for four more to take England past 200. England need “only” 175 more now. 70th over: England 188-3 (Root 30, Stokes 4), target 376 Nortje continues to get some brutish bounce from the pitch, rapping Root in the wrist with a short one speared down the onside. A fuller delivery enables the captain to add two runs, followed by a classy flick through midwicket for four. Dare I say it, but this has been an encouraging start to the afternoon for England.69th over: England 182-3 (Root 24, Stokes 4), target 376 The magic mallet comes out again to bang down a ot by the crease at the bowler’s end, before Philander’s first ball – a real loosener, short and wide – is cut emphatically for four by Root, who scampers a single next ball. Philander is not looking so menacing from this end. “I’ve read every BTL comment on every cricket article since about 2005, and it hasn’t done me any harm,” writes James Debens, from behind a 14-year-old pile of washing up and pizza boxes, before ruining my gag with a pay-off of his own. “In fact, the wondrous insights, perspicacity and clear thinking of the BTL community have helped the years fly by, here at Rampton.”68th over: England 177-3 (Root 19, Stokes 4), target 376 The impressive Nortje returns from the Pavilion End. Root glides a shortish ball elegantly down to third man for a single – he’s looking Ok for a sick bloke – before Nortje torments Stokes from round the wicket again, ripping an absolute zinger away from his outside edge. This is going to be a tricky challenge for Stokes.67th over: England 176-3 (Root 18, Stokes 4), target 376 The excellent Philander starts off the session, but from the opposite end to that from which he operated this morning. He relishes bowling at Root, though he’ll need a breather before the second new ball. He concedes a four though, Root timing an on-drive exquisitely past mid-on. There’s a bit of uneven bounce again, though I thought this pitch would be much more unplayable by now at the end of day two.Before we return to the action, one more sage suggestion from Adrian Goldman: “I suggest Pasta-pesto with a salad. Dead simple, avoids all the hated food groups and - if you make your own pesto - you can add enough garlic to make sure that people leave soon after lunch. Problem sorted.Adrian(I am contributing content so moving the dial…)”Personally, I would say the internet contains more content than consumption. Has anyone who has ever contributed to a 1,578-comment long debate actually read the previous 1,577 for example? Face it, people – we’re all howling into the void.Mike Waters has some more serious cricketing thoughts to offer:hi Rob, I have had the mixed fortune to be able to watch every ball from my recliner and also have empathy with the virus stricken by catching what may be the same affliction being suffered by the sqaud.Having had to drag myself into work for Christmas day to cover a preareanged shift, fortunately spent mainly alone in an office, I have to commend anyone who has even managed to put whites on, never mind be involved on 90mph bowling in any capacity while fighting the most debiliating bug I can recall in my life.Looking at the batting to come, it struck me just how little Branderson appear to contribute to the team when not bowling these days. Both are talented batsmen and fielders, Jimmy perhaps only second to Stokes in the slips. Both unfortunately give the impression that batting is no more than a hinderence and their place on the fielding team is where they are least likely to see the ball. This from a man with a proper test ton and another with plenty of evidence of talent, and they should be batting 8 and 10 in this side, not leaving Archer to cop the critisism for the failing tail, and taking pressure off Curran to simply bat without expectations.Nobody since Strauss has really been strong enough with the pair, so it was refreshing to see Stokes laying down the law at Broad yesterday. Perhaps the leadership to get the best from the old stagers is there, just in the wrong role at the moment.Broad’s batting has long been a frustrating thing, even before the Varun Aaron blow that so jolted his form. But yeah, England’s frail tail has joined the long list of Things Wrong With England’s Test Team. And responsibility needs to be taken.Meanwhile, Kim Thonger has a familiar culinary dilemma: “We have family arriving for lunch and I’m cooking risotto to break the culinary monotony of the last week. However in attendance are one vegetarian daughter, another daughter who hates mushrooms, an aunt who is allergic to prawns and two grandchildren who are appalled by rice. I can now empathise with the England selectors whose intractable problems appear to be of a similar size. We may scrap the risotto entirely and just have afters, a solution akin to cancelling all red ball cricket and focusing on The Hundred.” Nice analogy. The Hundred really is the butterscotch Angel Delight of cricketing competitions. Anyway, can’t mushroom-averse daughters usually be placated with fish fingers, and beans? They can when they’re younger anyhow.Thanks Rob, and morningafternoon everyone. So England need 205 in five sessions, and my inner Fred Boycott would love to see them drag this chase deep into the final day and give tomorrow’s OBOers some serious work to do. And given the sluggish rate England were forced to inch along at this morning, thanks to some excellent South African bowling, this all could still happen. Or England could be all out for 208 by half-eleven. Anyway, all to play for66th over: England 171-3 (Root 13, Stokes 4) Root repels Rabada’s final over before lunch without alarm. It’s been South Africa’s morning, with England scoring 50 from 25 overs for the loss of the two overnight batsmen. England need another 205 runs for a record-breaking victory. South Africa have a new ball available in 14 overs’ time, and I suspect that will be decisive.Tom Davies will be with you for the afternoon session - you can email him here. I’ll see you after tea, unless England fall over in a heap. 65th over: England 170-3 (Root 12, Stokes 4) Keshav Maharaj comes into the attack. That’s a good move from Faf du Plessis, just to tempt Stokes into bringing out the long handle. He slog-swept Maharaj for consecutive sixes in the first innings, and hit him for four in six balls at the Oval in 2017. This time, with the ball spitting out of rough and lunch only a few minutes away, he treats him with caution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7a863b9f8ef8c8629820f602b906a959593504a/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c7529dceff74b78c20975df8c47e1f2","title":"10 great winter holidays europe for non skiers","story":"Mountain spas and dog-sledding, cosy cabins and roaring fires … You don’t need to hit the slopes to enjoy a snowy breakIn winter, the hills around Salzburg are alive with the sound of snowshoes shushing across frozen slopes.

Caricatures are regarded by most Muslims as highly offensive.In 2005, Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published cartoons of Muhammad that sparked demonstrations across the Muslim world as well as several attempts to kill either its editor or cartoonist Kurt Westergaard.Ten years later, in Paris, a pair of Islamist gunmen killed 12 people at the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo, also known for publishing satirical cartoons of Muhammad.

The climate crisis will continue to set the agenda. The vegan revolution will bring sweeping changes to eating habits. The Windsors will make headlines. And Adele will sing of heartbreak. Our team of experts ring in the new yearThe rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here.There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year.At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options.As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London.After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia.

In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed.Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally.For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed.Greenland is losing its ice sheet seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, and the west Antarctic ice sheet is now destabilising dangerously – threatening sea-level rises that will be devastating in low-lying Bangladesh and Pacific islands in the near future. Temperatures also reached record highs in Australia, triggering continent-wide bushfires, while in Africa, the Victoria Falls – one of the planet’s greatest cascades of water – dried to a trickle in 2019. The Glasgow talks will take place against this grim, ecological background.

We then enter a transition period while there are tough and complex negotiations about the future relationship with our closest neighbours and most important trading partners. Boris Johnson says he can secure a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal without having to commit to regulatory alignment with the bloc. The EU suggests it will never agree to this. The Tory leader has further upped the stakes by declaring that the UK will crash out of the transition without a deal if there’s no agreement by the end of the year. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially its manufacturers and the livelihoods of the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him to a majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will have been called or he will betray those new Tory voters.There will not be another referendum on independence for Scotland in 2020. The SNP will demand it, but without any real conviction that it can get one from a Conservative government that has set an adamantine face against the idea. This refusal will suit the Nationalists. Current polling suggests that they can’t be confident of winning a referendum now, and a second defeat would surely kill their ambition for a long time. The SNP’s true aim is to stoke Scottish resentment against Westminster to pave the way for a big win in the elections to the Scottish parliament in 2021. That’s the year with the potential for a constitutional car crash that rips apart the kingdom.Both the Lib Dems and Labour will choose new leaders. Most of the attention will be focused on the latter contest, which is expected to climax around March. Expect bitter rows about the election process as the Corbynites who control the party’s national executive committee try to fix the terms of the battle to favour their continuity candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey. Labour moderates are already saying that the succession of a beardless variation of Jeremy Corbyn will doom Labour to another decade in opposition. If that happens, the moderates will be asking whether the party is dead to them and they should try something different.

Can he stick to his pledges or will the wheels start to come off his premiership in 2020?Nicola SturgeonFollowing a resounding victory in Scotland in the December 2019 general election, all eyes will be on the leader of the SNP in the year ahead to see how she manages to capitalise on her popularity in her push for Scottish independence.Rebecca Long BaileyShe has a tough battle ahead against increasing numbers of candidates for the Labour party leadership.

Highlights will include Jungle Boy, an early etching by David Hockney.In the cinema, the British year gets off to a good start with Sam Mendes’ 1917 and Armando Iannucci’s The Personal History of David Copperfield, both out in January, but the new Bond, No Time to Die, is now not being released until April.Smaller budget productions to look out for include Rose Glass’s acclaimed horror debut Saint Maud, starring Morfydd Clark, and the film of Florian Zeller’s stage hit The Father, which premieres at the Sundance film festival in January.

A gift from an American visitor, it portrays Moses as a rugged Israelite matinee idol a Charlton Heston in the desert. It is, Iványi smiles, “a bit kitsch”.Iványi himself has the look of an Old Testament prophet, dressed in black and sporting a splendid biblical white beard. But there is nothing kitsch about him. The president of the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship – a small Methodist offshoot which played a heroic part in the anti-communist struggles of the 1970s and 80s – Iványi is a well-known figure in Hungary’s religious landscape. Now approaching 70, he is also a controversial one.On the first Sunday of December, together with other pastors from his church and a few like minds from different denominations, Iványi published an extraordinary and furious text.Modelled on the Barmen Declaration of 1934, which denounced the Nazification of German churches through the Deutsche Christen movement, the “Advent Statement” rejects the claims of Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to be running a Christian government. Orbán likes to boast that his administration, in contrast to secular equivalents in western Europe, is dedicated to a distinctive notion of “Christian liberty”.Denouncing his government’s centralisation of power and marginalisation of minorities, Iványi and his co-authors rebut that claim in passionate prose: “We are calling for resistance to an arrogance of power that makes the concept of ‘Christian liberty’ a slogan for exclusionary, hate-filled and corrosive policy a power that destroys the social fabric … that systematically threatens democracy and the rule of law. True Christian freedom is always threatened by a politics that separates and isolates. The authoritarian exercise of power is spreading around the world but especially before our eyes in Hungary.” As biblical evidence, the declaration cites the Gospel of Matthew, verse 25: “I was hungry and you gave me something to eat … I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me.”The European Union has initiated disciplinary proceedings against Hungary over issues relating to its asylum policies, press freedom and judicial independence. This intervention though, is in a different register altogether. And far closer to home.Iványi knows Orbán well from the tumultuous days of communism’s collapse, when they were on the same side. He baptised two of the prime minister’s children, and when the up-and-coming politician embraced Christianity in the 1990s, he renewed Orbán’s marriage vows in his church. Relations have soured dramatically since then, as Iványi has refused to give cover to his old ally’s drift to the authoritarian right. In 2011, a year after Orbán was re-elected as prime minister, state funding to the Evangelical Fellowship church was withdrawn. It will certainly remain a pariah organisation after this declaration. But Iványi has no doubts that this needed to be done.“We are ringing the alarm bell. Of course there are differences between now and the 1930s but it is the similarities we should focus on. Orbán wants to become the charismatic leader of a nationalist European right. He talks about the restoration of lands Hungary lost at Versailles after the first world war, 100 years ago. That’s dangerous. He is a child playing with something that once made Europe burn.”It is, above all, Orbán’s determination to present his Fidesz government as distinctively Christian that led to the Advent statement. “He is turning the Christian message on its head,” says Iványi. “Is there any other Christian country in the world where it is written in the constitution that you can be jailed for being homeless? Is it a Christian country where asylum seekers are not given the basic resources they need to survive? Is it Christian to use power to abolish media freedoms, the independence of judges and academic autonomy?“In ancient Israel, the prophets spoke out against corruption and wickedness. We are now compelled to speak out. We might not be Isaiahs or Jeremiahs. But we take courage from their example.”Iványi is respected far beyond his own congregations by those who remember his courage before 1989. But in challenging Orbán so brazenly, he stands almost alone. Though invited to sign the declaration, the Hungarian Reformed church, the Catholic church and the Evangelical-Lutherans declined.“The other churches should be doing far more,” he says. “If they stood together for what is right, then Orbán couldn’t do the things he does. Refugees starve at our borders. George Soros is demonised with antisemitic overtones. But no one from the churches speaks out. Jesus told his disciples: ‘You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavour, with what shall it be salted?’ In Hungary, the churches should be the salt of the earth. Preaching the gospel is not a philosophical exercise.”The battle between Iványi and Orbán over the meaning of Christianity goes to the heart of Europe’s culture wars. Serving as a reboot of his original doctrine of “illiberal democracy”, the idea of “Christian liberty” is defined by Orbán as a politics of “the common good”, dedicated to the protection of the nation’s culture, values and borders. Liberal internationalism and inidualism, which uproots citizens from the ties that bind, threaten this vision of warm, rooted and homogenous community. More migration, says Orbán, “would destroy Europe, the way we know it today”.This type of thinking has blazed a trail for rightwing populist movements across Europe, as supposedly Christian values have been weaponised. The battlegrounds of choice have ranged from so-called “gender ideology” to multiculturalism, LGBT rights and abortion. And as politicians such as Orbán claim that God is on their side, liberal parishioners, priests, pastors, bishops, cardinals and ministers have faced a dilemma: speak out or stay silent about the dangers of a domineering politics that demonises minorities and outsiders.Last year, the duty of the Hungarian state to protect the country’s Christian culture was duly enshrined in the constitution. Such exalted status comes with obligations. A few weeks ago, the new 68,000-capacity Puskás Aréna opened in Budapest in November – the latest and biggest stadium to be built by the football-mad prime minister. Assembled heads of the Catholic, Lutheran and other churches dutifully blessed the stadium, to the bemusement of churchgoers such as Krisztina Rakoczy, a practising Catholic in her 20s, who wryly comments: “These days football is the real religion in Hungary.”November also saw church leaders attend a high-profile Budapest conference on the fate of persecuted Christians around the world. Attended by representatives of faith communities from Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and elsewhere, it highlighted an issue that Orbán claims, with justification, has been neglected by western media and governments.Hungary has established a dedicated government ministry for persecuted Christians, and through the charity, Hungary Helps, offers aid and assistance to communities in difficulty – funding, for example, the restoration of hundreds of Islamic State-destroyed homes in Bakhdida, Iraq’s largest Christian town. Those deemed outside Orbán’s ideal community are treated with far less charity and sometimes with outright cruelty. Speaking to the conference, Orbán banged the drum on Muslim migration yet again, stating that the kind of persecution of Christians taking place in Syria, Iraq and Nigeria was closer to happening in Europe than “many people think”. With that in mind, Fidesz continues to resist mandatory EU migrant quotas and make life as difficult as possible for asylum seekers and refugees detained on the country’s borders. Food has allegedly been illegally withheld from asylum seekers whose claims are pending. Legislation to criminalise the act of offering assistance to asylum seekers with their applications was passed last year.In the wake of the migration crisis of 2015, which prompted Orbán to fence off Hungary’s border with Serbia, senior church figures from both the Catholic and Lutheran churches made public calls for the compassionate treatment of refugees. More recently, on migration and other social issues – such as rising homophobia, the treatment of Hungary’s Roma population, and the criminalising of the homeless – there has been relative silence. Among liberal Christians, there is a growing sense that a moral duty is being shirked.Alexander Faludy is a British-Hungarian former vicar who ides his time between London and Budapest. His grandfather, György, a well-known poet, was sent to a labour camp by the communist regime. After 1989, György returned from exile and received national acclaim as his work was at last published in Hungary. The historical dimension, Faludy believes, helps explain why Hungary’s main churches have allowed themselves to be co-opted into Orbán’s vision.After 10 years in which Orbán’s grip on civil society has been relentlessly strengthened, Faludy says: “At best, the churches have chosen quietism rather than prophetic vocation.”Dóra Laborczi founded a blog for the Hungarian Lutheran church on public life. Disillusioned with the church’s timidity, she now edits an independent one called “Christian culture”, which attacks the intrusion of rightwing populism into Hungary’s religious life. “It gets exasperating dealing with all the stock phrases,” she says. “The aggressive polemics against refugees, the homeless, the poor, NGOs, same-sex marriage and any gender issues. The references to a ‘Bible of Death’ when discussing homosexuality. Constant reference to murder when abortion comes up.”In the Lutheran church, she says, as in others, there is a fear of stepping out of line. “They try to say nothing because they fear the trouble it will cause and the members they will lose. Ten years ago, the Lutheran church could have a debate about gay people’s place in the church. That wouldn’t happen now. Rightwing populism dominates the church, and secular liberals are ferociously anti-religion. Christians like me often feel isolated and alone.”Laborczi’s husband used to be a Lutheran pastor. “He works in IT now,” she says. Laborczi often thinks back to a conversation with her father when she was young and Hungary’s post-communist democracy was in its infancy.“My father said I was going to grow up in a free democratic society,” she says. “But I feel on some level I’m living something similar to what he experienced when it comes to the silence and self-censorship that goes on, even if there aren’t any black cars arriving on doorsteps.”A 15-minute drive from the heart of Budapest, on the ragged northern periphery of the city, the House of Reconciliation has almost filled up by 9am on the second Sunday of Advent. This compact red-brick church is the centre of worship for the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship. It is a remarkable building, designed to express solidarity between the Christian and Jewish faiths. On each larchwood pew, a star of David has been carved, and on this sunny December day light streams through a large Menorah-shaped window.One by one, members of the congregation stand up to dedicate the day’s service: “May my son’s broken wrist heal quickly,” says one woman. “May this lovely sunshine continue,” says another to laughter. Then a third woman rises to say: “May our theatres be successfully defended from the government’s new legislation and may the demonstration against it succeed tomorrow.”The prayer refers to a law giving the state a role in the appointment of theatre directors. Duly passed, it defines the purpose of the arts as the protection of “the interests of the nation’s survival, wellbeing and growth”. A well-attended demonstration did take place however, and was addressed by the newly elected liberal mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony. Karácsony has already given positive signals to the homeless shelter that Iványi’s church runs, and there is optimism that the battle against poverty and drug addiction in the city has a new, powerful ally.After the service, as the congregation chats over cups of tea, a guest is introduced. Judit Rajk is a well-known classical singer and the wife of the late László Rajk, an avant-garde architect who was blacklisted by the communist regime and became, more recently, a critic of Orbán. Rajk died in September and, gently prompted by Iványi, his wife tells a few stories about him, before saying sadly: “In recent years he wasn’t getting any contracts.” Filing out of the reception hall, Abel Tamas, whose wife Petra is a pastor in Iványi’s church, explains why he is also a supporter. “In the 1980s,” he says, “there was a hope that the new Hungary would be a liberal country where human rights were a reality. That liberal tradition survives in enclaves, and this place is one of them.” Tamas is Jewish. “For Hungarian Jews, this community is important not just for religious reasons. We know it is a place that will stand up for human rights.”Or, as Iványi’s Advent statement puts it: “We believe that God’s wisdom is reflected in our ersity and that we were all created in God’s wisdom and likeness. We want this image and likeness to be recognised and honoured in the image of the other person. We are speaking now because we sense the return of perils and shadows of the past.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

It’s the enemy of progress. After all, how can you move forward with your life if all you’re doing is looking back, living in the past and uttering melancholic sighs of: “Ah, those were the days” as your eyes slowly glaze over? What about these days you’re living right now, and the days after those, and the days after those?That’s the received wisdom, anyway. But where did it come from? Back in the 17th and 18th centuries, nostalgia was viewed as a medical disease that manifested itself through irregular heartbeats and full-on bouts of weeping among other maladies, and it was attributed to demons – demons! – attacking the middle brain. That might have something to do with it.Today, while we associate nostalgia with warm, fuzzy feelings related to our childhoods, or other times in our past that were especially happy, it still carries negative connotations in our live-in-the-moment culture. But, we may be looking at this all wrong. At least, that’s what Tim Wildschut, professor of social and personality psychology at the University of Southampton, believes.“People in a nostalgic mood are more optimistic about their future, and are more inspired to pursue their most important goals,” says Wildschut. “Rather than freezing them in place, nostalgia is very motivational – the past provides a template for what you’d like your future to look like. Maybe you went fishing with your dad, or cycling with your mum. You may develop the goal of having a family yourself and doing those things with your own children.”Of course, there are many things that can trigger nostalgia. Smells, tastes, photographs, you name it, you’ve probably experienced it. But perhaps one of the most potent is music. “Music is a very strong trigger of nostalgia,” says Wildschut. “We often use it in our studies to induce nostalgia it’s very effective, very efficient. But it’s important that it’s a personal thing. You really have to look at a person’s inidual experiences. It might be a completely obscure Spanish song that they listened to when they were in Spain with friends. To them it’s very nostalgic, but to anyone else it doesn’t mean anything.”It makes sense then, that the songs we listen to can be markers of significant events in our lives, able to transport us back with all the speed and efficiency of a flux capacitor-equipped DeLorean. For those of us who stream music, the Spotify Wrapped feature is an opportunity, at the end of each year, to relive those moments triggered by certain songs. And with this year marking a decade of Wrapped, that’s potentially 10 years of memories waiting to be rediscovered.As it turns out, hearing certain music picks me up and deposits me right into London in 2010. This music wasn’t topping charts, or indicative of the era to many, but it remains powerful to me because it represents a time in my life when I felt a real sense of community and belonging – perhaps the first time since I’d left college to go to university.Looking back, London in 2010 was an exhilarating place to be if you loved bass, beat and hip-hop music, which I did. It had been a couple of years since Flying Lotus (AKA Steven Ellison) dropped his breakthrough album Los Angeles on Warp Records, and the LA beat scene was expanding at a rapid pace – thanks in part to Lotus’ own Brainfeeder label, the Alpha Pup Records, and the exposure provided courtesy of British-based DJs Mary Anne Hobbs, Benji B and Gilles Peterson. And in Britain itself, producers such as Hudson Mohawke and Rustie – both hailing from Glasgow – were pushing their own hyperkinetic style of beat music to equally hyper audiences.At the time, I was editing a music blog I’d created with friends, and we were fully invested in the beat scene – partying at the Brainfeeder takeover of Fabric, getting sweaty and dancing until the early hours in east London warehouse spaces to a soundtrack of beats and basslines both wigged-out and dreamy. (Yes, I have tinnitus.) Everywhere we went, there were people we knew and enjoyed connecting with. It was like Cheers, but in clubs.I live in Cornwall now, married with two kids – but play me Double Fifths by Teebs, or Coat of Arms by Nosaj Thing, and that powerful sense of community I had nearly 10 years ago rushes right back. And while I haven’t yet found that same feeling of belonging in the south-west that I had back in London, like Wildschut says, the nostalgia I feel when I listen to these tracks doesn’t make me feel anxious, or even sad. Instead, I feel encouraged to seek out that local community – whether it’s based on music or not – with more vigour, and more verve, because, well, I want that feeling again. Ah, those were the days.To celebrate the end of the decade, Spotify is unlocking 10 years of your streaming data. Get your Wrapped now and relive the music that mattered to you."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach forecasts pay rising \u0026lsquofaster than the cost of living\u0026rsquo under next public sector pay dealIncreasingly hatred, racism, and a creeping anti\u0026ndashSemitism, are part of this worldCouncillor criticises operator for delays which have \u0026lsquoimpacted majorly on many locals\u0026rsquoDriver, aged in his 30s, killed after vehicle leaves road and hits ditchIdentification of remains found in derelict house hampered by body being decapitatedFrequent bomb attacks on the railway line during the Troubles caused severe damage and disrupted servicesBritish failed to implement promised reforms of force despite numerous murder and serious criminal convictionsGovernment and public condemnation forced rugby body to apologise and vow never to play in the country while apartheid laws remainedDepartment expressed fears over use of private facilities for European Council meetingsState papers: \u0026lsquoPotentially disastrous situation\u0026rsquo avoided when Dublin to Belfast train was held up before bomb exploded in LurganFormer minister believed facility could \u0026lsquojeopardise\u0026rsquo Irish trade with Arab statesGarda\u0026iacute appeal for information after two women suffer serious injuries in incidentGarda\u0026iacute investigating after remains indicating severe injuries found at property near city centreGavin Ryan was brought before a special sitting of Waterford District Court on Friday\u0026lsquoShe entertained the homes of millions of Irish people for over 20 years,\u0026rsquo colleague saysTrams between Balally and Brides Glen impacted with limited service elsewhereFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD James Browne says HSE data shows \u0026lsquoextraordinary regional variations\u0026rsquoFire brigade urges public to check devices for genuine CE mark and not leave unattended while chargingClarice Rice was driver of car which went off the road in Portsalon on Friday nightGarda\u0026iacute say they are aware of inidual detained on European arrest warrant"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4118272.1576595797!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there was only one story of 2019 in irish politics and it wasn t swing gate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThough Leo Varadkar played Brexit cannily, he spent much of 2019 under domestic pressure. Photograph: Nick BradshawThere is only one candidate for the story of 2019 in Irish politics: Brexit dominated everything. So much did Irish politics progress in the shadow of Brexit that for long periods it seemed that the true epicentre of Irish politics was in Westminster, or occasionally, Brussels. That was how the year began, and that was how the year ended.Twelve months ago, a weakened Theresa May finally concluded a withdrawal agreement with the EU after months of painstaking and painful negotiations. But the House of Commons threw it back at her with a record defeat. She began the new year determined to try again, but – despite concessions, extensions and missed deadlines – May couldn’t deliver the majority.On May 24th, having failed for the third time to get the withdrawal agreement passed, she announced her resignation. After a lengthy leadership battle Boris Johnson was elected Conservative leader, and became prime minister.GovernmentIn Dublin, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar played it cool, waiting days for a phone call and weeks for a meeting with the new occupant of Number 10. When the two men did meet, they seemed to rather hit it off. Varadkar told Johnson on the steps of Government Buildings that Ireland would be Athena to his Hercules. “Ring me!” gestured Johnson as he departed.They met again in New York and then, with the clock ticking towards a no-deal Brexit, Varadkar dashed to the Wirral near Liverpool for a supposedly private meeting. They emerged hours later with the makings of a deal: changes to the withdrawal agreement that Ireland could live with and that Johnson could pass.Johnson accepted some checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK Varadkar gave up the backstop. It was now, the headlines shouted, a “frontstop”.It was the deal that unlocked agreement, and unlocked Brexit. Johnson promising to “get Brexit done”, romping home in the subsequent election.But if Varadkar played Brexit cannily, he spent much of the year under domestic pressure.Early in the year, the Government was hammered on the spiralling costs of the Children’s Hospital project, about which it seemed frequently unsure. At the same time the cost of the national broadband plan, an ambitious design to bring high-speed broadband to every home and premises in Ireland (whether they wanted it or not) was also rocketing towards €3 billion.With overspending across a range of Government departments – health led the way as usual – and the sharp criticism of the Fiscal Advisory Council for its budgetary plans, Fine Gael’s reputation for prudent and responsible management of the public finances, always more vaunted within the party than without, took a battering.The trouble with Fine Gael, social welfare minister Regina Doherty told an RTÉ interview, is that we have been too prudent and too responsible. This was not a proposition for which there was an abundance of evidence in 2019.Appreciating the reality of this, the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe cleverly used the threat of a no-deal budget to dampen expectations of a giveaway pre-election budget. It went some way towards rehabilitating Fine Gael’s economic management credentials, even if that remains very much a work in progress.By and large, the various strands of the opposition observed the traditional practice of demanding responsible budgeting while endorsing the spending demands of every lobby group that knocked on their door.Micheál Martin’s late-year difficulties with his TDs’ curious voting habits demonstrated once again that his biggest problems are often found in his own party. Yet he finishes the year in a better position to put together a coalition than does his chief rival.It was a difficult year for the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who presided over a massacre of half its local authority seats at the local and European elections in May. The party took refuge in incessant campaigning for a united Ireland as the answer to Brexit, but this seemed more designed to comfort its supporters than convince unionists.The party took solace in a spectacular byelection win in Dublin Mid-West and in John Finucane’s unseating of Nigel Dodds (facilitated by the SDLP standing aside) in North Belfast in the UK general election.But the decline in the party’s vote across Northern Ireland showed that it is not just in the Republic where Sinn Féin declined this year. The once-irresistible rise of Sinn Féin has not just been arrested it has gone into reverse. The next election could decide the future of Mary Lou McDonald’s leadership.For the Green Party, new possibilities opened up this year. The party capitalised on public concern about climate change to record its best ever local and European results and has the opportunity next year for a significant breakthrough if it can maintain momentum.Leader Eamon Ryan has his sights set on government, though many within his party are nervous about the compromises required to wield power – and about doing a coalition deal with either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Ryan knows it will have to be one or the other.The Labour Party, still scarred from its last experience of government, made some progress towards reviving itself this year, with decent local election results (they outpolled the Greens) and good showings in the Wexford and Fingal byelections. But the party’s chances of a meaningful comeback remain concentrated in a handful of constituencies. Even if it succeeds, the question of government will be a difficult one for the party.ConductThe year saw a sharp focus on the conduct of inidual TDs. Maria Bailey’s personal injuries case against a Dublin hotel became a cause célèbre which spiralled out of control for her after a disastrous radio interview. The controversy ultimately resulted in her being removed from the party’s general election ticket.Fianna Fáil TDs Timmy Dooley, Niall Collins, Lisa Chambers and Barry Cowen apologised after voting irregularities, while the Galway Independent Noel Grealish was widely criticised after comments about asylum seekers at a public meeting, and further accusations about immigrants’ remittances to their home countries in the Dail.The Fine Gael candidate in the Wexford byelection Verona Murphy also apologised after comments about asylum seekers, and her continued position on the general election ticket remains an open question as the year ends. The year demonstrated that the immigration and\u0026nbspasylum issue is edging its way into Irish politics – but also that there is little tolerance in any party or the media for anti-immigrant rhetoric.Dara Murphy opened a sore for Fine Gael that will fester through to the general election. If this year is anything to go by, that campaign is likely to feature aggressive media scrutiny of candidates.Meanwhile, the preparations for the inevitable election continue. Like in the movie Casablanca (sure to be on television over Christmas), they wait, and wait, and wait..."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Joe Biden indicates he would testify in Donald Trump impeachment trial if subpoenaed Suspected North Korean boat with headless dead bodies found off Japan coastTory councillor exposes spate of anti-Semitic graffiti on synagogue and shops throughout north-LondonSydney New Year fireworks to go ahead despite Australian bushfire crisis as mass evacuations orderedEmmanuel Macron left isolated as he rejects advisers\u0026#39 pleas to soften pension reformsIran blasts France for \u0026#39interference\u0026#39 over jailed academic North Korea could be planning \u0026#39Christmas gift\u0026#39 of a space rocket launchLabour leaders\u0026#39 cronyism and anti-semitism to blame for Labour\u0026#39s \u0026#39catastrophic\u0026#39 loss, say defeated candidatesTributes paid to artist and author Alasdair Gray after he dies aged 85Comment: Christian Aid should drop the climate rubbish Comment: Was the 2010s the decade that was characterised by self-delusion?Comment: A Scottish independence weather warning: baby, it’s cold outside the Union Five stabbed during Hanukkah celebration at rabbi\u0026#39s home in New YorkInside the hidden clinics making up Hong Kong\u0026#39s underground resistance armyOusted Labour MPs call for \u0026#39fundamental change\u0026#39 in the party\u0026#39s leadershipComment: A letter to the Eurocrats: Britain’s quarrel is with you, not with EuropeEcoli rates soaring despite ministers\u0026#39 pledges to wage war on superbugs Comment: After a decade of change the Royal family is entering a new era of monarchy Iran digs in over jailed British-Australian academic Kylie Moore-GilbertBig Ben set to ring in the New Year for the first time since start of restoration workWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/11/08/TELEMMGLPICT000215443826_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqD3d2dmOlWYuQkR76XZjLQFZCNTBFEzjlWYpe7fFVCF0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"christmas showed much smartphones have become masters","story":"I had big reading ambitions for the Christmas break.

syrians seek shelter olive groves assad bombings intensify","story":"A man rides in a truck as civilians flee a Syrian military offensive in Idlib province on the main road near Hazano, SyriaIn the olive groves of north-west Syria, tarpaulin sheets stretched across barren trees do little to keep out the sleeting rain.The families huddle for warmth as the temperatures drop to nearly zero degrees celsius. Babies are bundled in coats and blankets, the adults burn wood and use up the last of their dwindling gas supplies. They are among the 235,000 people who have fled air strikes and shelling elsewhere in Idlib province in recent weeks. The exodus was triggered by ramped-up Syrian and Russian attacks on some of the most densely populated areas of the country’s last-remaining rebel bastion.So many have fled in such a short period that even the sprawling makeshift tent cities that abut the Turkish border are now full, forcing thousands to sleep out in the open.Aid agencies warn the situation is untenable and is now threatening to turn into one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the eight-year war. Syrians are seen with their belongings who have been forced to displace due to the ongoing attacks carried out by Assad regime and Russia, during winter season at makeshift tent area in Harbanos town of Idlib, Syria Even President Donald Trump, who is not usually moved to speak out about the plight of Syrians, tweeted on Thursday: “Russia, Syria, and Iran are killing, or on their way to killing thousands of innocent civilians in Idlib Province. “Don’t do it! Most of the 3.5 million people living in the province had been displaced from formerly rebel-held areas across the country and as a result have nowhere left to go.Turkey, which is already hosting the largest number of refugees of any country in the world, closed the frontier with Syria in response to the 2015 migrant crisis and built a wall to stem the flow.They have been sending in truckloads of aid into Idlib and accepting some of its most urgent medical cases, but have signalled they are not prepared to offer much else.It is in Europe’s interest to help avoid a large-scale humanitarian disaster. Ankara has threatened to send new arrivals its way if it is pressured to open the border.Syrian families, who have been forced to displace despite attacks carried out by Assad regime and Russia, sit on soil field despite the cold weather during winter season at Harbanush village in Idlib, SyriaEarlier this month, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, told the EU to prepare for a “new wave” of Syrian refugees, saying his country “will not carry the migration burden alone.”Civilians in Idlib say they feel abandoned by Turkey, which has been the opposition’s main backer during the uprising against the government.Turkey has been strengthening its alliance with Russia, a key ally of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, in recent months. Western diplomats say they believe Ankara agreed something of a quid pro quo with Moscow - if the latter turns a blind eye to the former’s operation against Syrian Kurdish militias, it will not stand in its way over Idlib. The move has effectively sold out the revolution.Families unable to find tents due to overcrowding sleep under the olive grovesMustafa Sejari, a senior official in the Turkey-backed rebel Syrian National Army, pleaded with Mr Erdogan in an open letter, asking for him to take a “historic stand” by opening Turkey’s borders to women and children, and resuming military support to opposition forces.The Syrian offensive is part of the regime’s strategy to secure the M4 and M5 highways running through Idlib, both key routes connecting the government-controlled cities of Aleppo and Hama with capital Damascus.Assad has promised to retake “every inch” of Syria, but the rebels, who are largely aligned with Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), have had years to dig in.The city of Maaret al-Numan, which had a population of around 100,000, has been at the centre of Assad’s most recent campaign. It had become known for its fierce resistance to the regime, but also in more recent times for its resistance to HTS and the hardline groups who overran it.Intense shelling and strikes has driven out virtually the entire population. Footage captured by a handful of remaining residents shows a decimated ghosttown.Dareen Khalifa, a Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group, said she believed government forces have been “overcompensating” for the slow progress made so far in Idlib by using “devastating levels of air force.”A smoke plume billows following a reported Syrian government air strike on a residential district of Maaret al-Numan in the northwestern Idlib province“If the regime continues and if the rebels don’t surrender, this will mean the worst humanitarian disaster we’ve seen in Syria,” she said. “The casualties and displacement levels are catastrophic.”Mahmoud Sadeq, a 30-year-old father of two young children, was forced to flee his house in Maaret al-Numan last week. “On Friday, Dec 20, we woke up to the sound of warplanes and airstrikes,” he told the  by phone. “The regime and Russia began a brutal aerial assault as well as shelling from troops on the ground. Friday is a day to remember because the bombing didn’t stop for a minute, it was continuous, fierce, and hysterical.“I waited until the bombing eased down. By dawn of Saturday, I rode a motorbike with my wife and two children, who are three years old and one month old, and we fled the city towards Binnish in the northeast of Idlib, I drove slowly because the weather was so cold, so we suffered a lot, the trip took two hours.”The family is now seeking shelter in a building next to an orchid field. All they managed to take with them was a change of clothes, a gas cylinder for cooking, a small amount of food supplies and photographs. Few places are safe. Earlier this month a refugee camp was bombed, leaving at least 16 civilians dead and 50 wounded. There have been at least 65 attacks on 47 health facilities in Idlib since the offensive began in earnest in April, according to the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS). Earlier this year, UN officials alleged Russian forces may be deliberately targeting hospitals and schools as a tactic to terrorise civilians - accusations denied by both Damascus and Moscow.The UN in Syria on Tuesday sent an email to local NGOs saying its request for a pause in fighting had been met, and encouraged people in Maarat al-Numan to leave. Hours later, Russian warplanes bombed a school, killing six children.The bombing campaign has killed more than 5,262 civilians, including 246 children, since April, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group. More than 100 of whom died in the last week.Russia and China last week vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have allowed aid to continue flowing to Idlib. The UN, US and its European partners have been able to do little other than issue statements of condemnation.“It seems that 2019 was the year the international community and the UN completely abandoned Syria and politicians have even run out of words of condemnation,” said Raed Al Saleh, head of the White Helmets civil defence this week. “My biggest fear as the year comes to a close is for the attacks to intensify further, causing new waves of displacement because there is nowhere left for people to run to. Every olive tree has become a tent and every camp has exceeded its capacity ten times over,” he said. “I still cannot understand how the world’s most powerful nations can meet those horrors with silence and inaction.”Tory councillor exposes spate of anti-Semitic graffiti on synagogue and shops throughout north-LondonSydney New Year fireworks to go ahead despite Australian bushfire crisis as mass evacuations orderedEmmanuel Macron left isolated as he rejects advisers\u0026#39 pleas to soften pension reformsIran blasts France for \u0026#39interference\u0026#39 over jailed academic North Korea could be planning \u0026#39Christmas gift\u0026#39 of a space rocket launchLabour leaders\u0026#39 cronyism and anti-semitism to blame for Labour\u0026#39s \u0026#39catastrophic\u0026#39 loss, say defeated candidatesTributes paid to artist and author Alasdair Gray after he dies aged 85Comment: Christian Aid should drop the climate rubbish Comment: Was the 2010s the decade that was characterised by self-delusion?Comment: A Scottish independence weather warning: baby, it’s cold outside the Union Five stabbed during Hanukkah celebration at rabbi\u0026#39s home in New YorkInside the hidden clinics making up Hong Kong\u0026#39s underground resistance armyOusted Labour MPs call for \u0026#39fundamental change\u0026#39 in the party\u0026#39s leadershipComment: A letter to the Eurocrats: Britain’s quarrel is with you, not with EuropeEcoli rates soaring despite ministers\u0026#39 pledges to wage war on superbugs Comment: After a decade of change the Royal family is entering a new era of monarchy Iran digs in over jailed British-Australian academic Kylie Moore-GilbertBig Ben set to ring in the New Year for the first time since start of restoration workPutting BBC presenter on a return flight to Sweden to interview Greta Thunburg \u0026#39felt awkward\u0026#39Comment: Violence on Britain\u0026#39s streets is being fuelled by guns, knives and drugs trafficked from abroadWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000199616212_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqzZqOgOJXOqkE_ZaqGDwVPIDFpkJIALGJc3DI2UF95ng.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"2010s decade characterised self delusion","story":"Post-Brexit and Trump, the belief that it is the mark of sensitivity to be a Nervous Nellie has found a wider political contextWhen did we stop ascribing qualities to decades?

I hope you enjoy these as much as I did.”Obama is known for being a voracious reader, and in a longer post on Instagram noted how his annual lists had become “a fun little tradition”.“Because while each of us has plenty that keeps us busy -— work and family life, social and volunteer commitments — outlets like literature and art can enhance our day-to-day experiences,” he wrote. “They’re the fabric that helps make up a life.”Included on this year’s list is the Booker Prize-winning Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo Lost Children Archive, a novel by Valeria Luiselli inspired in part by the ongoing American policy of separating children from their parents at the Mexican-American border and Normal People by Sally Rooney.Click through the gallery below to see the full list:Created with Sketch.Barack Obama\u0027s favourite books of 2019 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.119 The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power by Shoshana Zuboff219 The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company by William Dalrymple319 Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee by Casey Cep419 Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo519 The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present by David Treuer619 How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy by Jenny Odell719 Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli819 Lot: Stories by Bryan Washington919 Normal People by Sally Rooney1019 The Orphan Master’s Son by Adam Johnson1119 The Yellow House by Sarah M.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In exchange for a payment, whether in cash, supplies or services, a TV show or a film would prominently display a brand-name product.Then there was virtual product placement. Products or logos would be inserted into a show during editing, thanks to computer-generated imagery.Now, with the rise of Netflix and other streaming platforms, the practice of working brands into shows and films is likely to get more sophisticated. In the near future, according to marketing executives who have had discussions with streaming companies, the products that appear on screen may depend on who is watching.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn other words, a viewer known to be a whiskey drinker could see a billboard for a liquor brand in the background of a scene, while a teetotaler watching the same scene might see a billboard for a fizzy water company.Streaming services could also drop in brand-name products based on when a show is being watched. Someone who watches a streaming show in the morning could see a carton of orange juice within a character’s reach, while a different viewer watching the same thing in the afternoon could see a can of soda.Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 40.

With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display.

It is clearly daylight, but suddenly, after the police chase, it’s pitch black.When Jack (Leonardi DiCaprio) is painting a naked Rose (Kate Winslet) and tells her to go over by the bed, and then says he means the couch, it was DiCaprio flubbing his lines. But James Cameron kept it in the film because it was funny. The blockbuster featured about 33 mistakes, including a scene in which lead actor Chris Pratt talks to co-star Bryce Dallas Howard without his mouth moving. In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.The Tim Burton-directed superhero film has multiple mistakes, but a major one happens in the scene when Joker and his crew deface paintings at a museum.

But he doesn’t have them anymore in the fight scene. And then they reappear on his wrists a few moments later.Ridley Scott’s epic film took place many centuries before fuel-powered vehicles. But during the Battle of Carthage, a gas canister can be seen on the back of a chariot when it flips over.There is a mix up over whether it is day or night at the beginning of the stock market heist scene in Christopher Nolan’s film. It is clearly daylight, but suddenly, after the police chase, it’s pitch black.When Jack (Leonardi DiCaprio) is painting a naked Rose (Kate Winslet) and tells her to go over by the bed, and then says he means the couch, it was DiCaprio flubbing his lines. But James Cameron kept it in the film because it was funny. The blockbuster featured about 33 mistakes, including a scene in which lead actor Chris Pratt talks to co-star Bryce Dallas Howard without his mouth moving. In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A number of well-known iniduals have refused an honour for a variety of reasons, whether political, personal, or because they did not feel it was appropriate given their line of work.Created with Sketch.The best films of 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 20. Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

Alex PollardHere is a run-down of\u0026nbspfamiliar faces who have spurned their New Year\u0027s honour:Skepta\u0026nbspclaimed he had turned down an MBE for the 2017 New Year\u0027s Honours via a new track, titled Hypocrisy.\u0026nbspIn the second verse of Hypocrisy, the grime artist raps: “Just came back from the Ivors And look at what we collected The MBE got rejectedI\u0027m not trying to be accepted.”The musician rejected a CBE in 2006. In a statement a spokesperson for Weller simply said: “Paul was surprised and flattered, but it wasn’t really for him.”The journalist and author said in 2006 she had been “stupid” to accept an MBE, which she later returned.Government publishes home addresses of New Year Honours recipientsElton John reacts to receiving Companion of Honour award“I was stupid once and allowed myself to accept an MBE, partly to please my mum, who was always afraid that my big mouth would get us deported from here, as we were from Uganda, she wrote.“Then the poet Benjamin Zephaniah shamed me live on Channel 4 News, just as the Iraq war was building up and my republicanism was solidifying.“I returned the lovely object and have had to put up with scorn ever since, some deserved. But I now speak with the zeal of a convert. The honours system sucks and we should start again, devise a fair and independent new method to annually acclaim exceptional citizens for their contribution to the nation, not to overweening political parties or the\u0026nbspsemi-skilled, dysfunctional Windsors.”The film director, whose films focus on social issues such as poverty and homelessness, spoke about turning down an OBE in 1977.“It’s all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the British Empire, which is a monument of exploitation and conquest, he said.“I turned down the OBE because it’s not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who’ve got it.”Playwright and author Alan Bennett turned down the offer of becoming a CBE in 1988 and then rejected a knighthood in 1996.He said the reason for doing so was because he did not believe that he could carry off being a knight: “I felt that, in my case, it just wouldn’t suit me, that’s all. It would be like wearing a suit every day of your life.”“I was offered an OBE a couple of years ago, but I said ‘no’, Jim Broadbent revealed in 2012.I’m not that comfortable with actors receiving honours, partly because I think they ought to go to those who really help others.“Besides, I like the idea of actors not being part of the establishment. We’re vagabonds and rogues, and we’re not a part of the authorities and establishment, really. If you mix the two together, things get blurry.”The Channel 4 News anchor who has a career ning 40 years and reported on major events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall and Nelson Mandela’s release from prison turned down an OBE on the grounds of being a journalist.He said he believed journalists shouldn’t take honours from the government, explaining: “I tried to find out why I’d been given it and was unable to get a clear answer, or, indeed to find out who had proposed me,” reports the New York Times.The celebrated poet turned down an OBE in 2003. Penning an article for the , he firmly asserted: “Benjamin Zephaniah OBE – no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.” Explaining he “gets angry” when hearing the word “empire” the poet also said it would have been better to give him “one of these empire things” for his work to combat racism or promoting animal rights rather than literature where “there are a whole lot of writers who are better than me.”French and SaundersThe comedy duo turned down OBEs in 2001. Saunders later told Source magazine in 2008: “If I felt I deserved a Damehood I’d accept it.”Looking back she said: “At the time, we felt that we were being paid very well to have a lot of fun. It didn’t seem right somehow… It felt a bit fake to stand alongside people who devoted their lives to truly worthy causes.”The beloved children’s author behind Charlie and the Chocolate Factory who died in 1990 reportedly refused a knighthood in 1986. His name was one of many revealed by the  after a Freedom of Information act in 2012.The iconic performer\u0026nbspspurned honours twice. He refused a CBE in 2000 and later a knighthood in 2003. The 68-year-old reportedly explained: “I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don’t know what it’s for. It’s not what I spent my life working for.The TV chef was another name who was revealed to have turned down an OBE in 2001. She explained: “I’m not saving lives and I’m not doing anything other than something I absolutely love.”The award-winning director was offered a knighthood following his successful Opening Ceremony routine at the London Olympics in 2012. He rejected Sir Danny, saying he’d rather be a “man of the people” and that he’s proud to be an “equal citizen” which was reflected in his Opening Ceremony.The Birds and Psycho director turned down a CBE in 1962 but later went on to accept a knighthood and was ‘Sir Alfred Hitchcock’ for only four months before his death in 1980. According to the Daily Mail, he originally refused the lesser title because it didn’t do justice to his contribution to British culture.The physicist who discovered DNA, along with James Watson, was offered a CBE in 1963 but declined, one year after they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. He apparently believed the British monarchy to be “out of date”, reported the Mail.In 2008, the scientist told how he was offered a knighthood in the late 1990s but declined –\u0026nbspreportedly over the UK government’s science funding.The Beatle didn’t exactly turn his MBE down, but returned it four years after receiving the accolade.The Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy author was among a 2003 list of leaked names of those who declined an honour. It is not clear what honour le Carre declined, or his reason for doing so.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Coban founded charity My Life My Say, which aims to make democracy accessible for young people.He said: “My parents always instilled into us to give something back to our community, so for one of their children to receive an MBE for the work he has done with his community – that will be huge.”Some well-known civil society figures have also been given top honours, including damehoods for Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizen’s Advice, and Julia Unwin, the former chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

Some 11 per cent of recipients consider themselves to have a disability: the highest proportion for this category since numbers on disability started to be reported in 2016.Yet only 9.1 per cent of recipients come from a Bame (black, Asian and minority ethnic) background, down from 12 per cent compared to last year, and 3.3 per cent of recipients identified as being LGBT+, down from 5 per cent in the 2019 list.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives.

I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so.

He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face.

But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Jo said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without.We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just dont know how long we can last like this.At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we cant afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.This comes as another young family were forced into debt and had to rely on handouts after having a five-week wait to receive Universal Credit.A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: We are in contact with Centre and have met a number of times to explain that we need to make up for the loss of the sports pitch.We have explained this position several times and what we’re doing to try and resolve it.The Council is supportive of the farm, and as landlord would be agreeable to the proposal.However, any sub-lease or change of use is subject to the necessary permissions and whilst we are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, there is a process to follow when someone wants to change the use of a sports field.We are working with Sport England to try to resolve this to allow their objection to the plans to be lted.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Universal Credit claimants could have Christmas benefits slashed  bosses pay wages early this month.Meanwhile, a five-week wait for Universal credit payouts has pushed a young family into debt and forced them to rely on handouts.And with changes coming into force in  around how Universal Credit works - find out how they will affect your payments.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The thick-as-mince rapper Stormzy may have said: “F*** Boris.”But, rather wonderfully, the British people turned out in huge numbers to say, “F*** Stormzy” and: “F*** Magic Grandpa.”It now looks like Brexit will get done and we have a government which MUST respect the wishes of all those new working-class people who voted for it.Boris is doing very well so far. It was a decent Queen’s Speech. And I like the idea his adviser Dominic Cummings has of building new nuclear power plants in the North of England.Lots of well-paid jobs and clean energy.

Reduce immigration. I mean really reduce it. To something like nine people per year. I get to choose who the nine are. Most of them will be from Hong Kong. Don’t underestimate the strength of feeling against unlimited immigration, BoJo. Andyou reduce immigration you won’t need to pave over half of our remaining countryside to build new houses. Our urgent need for housing is a consequence of a population expanding because of immigration. Stop sending children to the controversial Tavistock Clinic in London for gender realignment treatment.

How low-carbon can you go  Reduce meat and dairy consumption, as beef and sheep livestock have a high carbon footprint. If you’re not ready to go completely without, try Meat Free Mondays Grow your own: You don’t need a big garden. Salad leaves, chilli and herbs are just a few of the things that grow well in containers. It’s a low-cost way of reducing your reliance on super-market fruit and vegetables. Switch off when idle: Leaving TVs, games consoles, the washing machine and microwave on standby eats energy. Some appliances draw energy even when they are not being used and phone chargers are among the worst culprits. “Vampire power” costs each house up to £ a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Use energy-saving lightbulbs: LED bulbs can last up to , hours, while some newer models are good for double that. As they use far less energy, you will quickly see impressive savings on your energy bill each month. Which  magazine puts the annual cost of running an LED lightbulb at £., compared to £. for a CFLtype and £. for halogen. Over the course of an LED bulb’s very long letime, it can save you around £. Be a careful cook: Only use as much water as you need and cover your pans so you save energy. Overfilling your kettle is a waste of electricity so only boil as much as you need. Lose the plastic packaging: This wrapping is energy-intensive in its production and causes serious damage to habitats. Choose items that are light on packaging, and refill as much as possible. There is no reason to buy tomatoes on a plastic tray which is also wrapped in plastic. A loose tomato tastes just as good. Find out more about the supermarkets’ war against plastic. Go low: Set the washing machine at C or even C. Doing the laundry at C instead of C can be one third cheaper on energy. For lightly soiled clothes, try C. And make sure that your machine is full. Get free water-saving devices: Moving water around the country and treating it requires huge amounts of energy, so get in touch with your water company to find out what gadgets you can get for free, such as low-flow shower heads which use less water. Make your home cosy: Draught-proof your doors and windows, install secondary-film glazing, top up your loft insulation to cm and get your boiler serviced. Accord-ing to the Energy Saving Trust, loft insulation for a semi-detached house will cost around £, with £ savings a year, while insulating a mid-terrace house will cost around £ and save £ a year. Turn down radiators in rooms you are not using: You don’t need to heat a room you’re not in, so use radiator controls to adjust temperature. Slow down on fast fashion: We buy more and more clothes each year. So choose vintage items, rent something for those special occasions and don’t forget charity shops. Oxfam has a great online shop. For outfit rentals, try websites like byrotation, hirestreetuk and mywardrobehq. If you do really want to buy new clothes, look out for certications of sustain-ability. Use the Good On You app to find out which shops are reducing their impact on the environment. Watch super-market air miles: Potatoes do not rack up air miles like imported rice. Likewise, dairy has a high carbon footprint, so swap a latte for a regular coffee. Look for the Red Tractor symbol on food supplied by British farmers. Buy strawberries, for example, from Norfolk, not Morocco.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there is still work to do.Top-down control over who gets a chance to be a candidate is demoralising and messy.And they are still outnumbered by Labour’s membership. It’s time to ride the Boris wave and add , new members to the blue ranks.If Labour keep telling themselves Magic Grandad is perfect, and blaming the voters, then this is a chance for the Conservatives to steal a march.WHILE this dwindling decade was stuffed full of exciting political events, it was not a vintage era for decisive majority ­government.There have been thrills — from voters defying Project Fear to free our country from the EU, through to Boris ­Johnson’s crushing victory over Corbynism.And there have been spills — David Cameron’s abrupt exit from power, Theresa May’s loss of her majority, and the hijack of the Labour Party by the far Left. But there have been only a few moments — mere months in the past ten years — of certain, stable, clear government.We have had two hung parliaments, the uncomfortable alliance of the coalition, and a slim Tory majority which was swtly erted by the EU referendum.At Westminster’s worst, a Remainer Commons — helped by a self-indulgent Speaker — trapped a minority Government in office while denying it the power to do anything.It’s all been very entertaining, but entertainment value is not always a sign of great governmentToo often, hung parliaments and paralysed ministers proved unable to make urgent decisions.Important calls were postponed or fudged out of necessity, because the votes to get on with the job were simply not there.Smashing that obstacle to decision-making is one of the many things about the election result to celebrate.Getting Brexit done should only be the start of the changes made by a Government that at last has the chance to be radical and ambitious.Not everybody will be cheering, however. Obviously, the Opposition aren’t happy. And I expect we will soon see some signs of unhappiness from the upper ranks of the civil service, too.Why  First, because theof majority government is a rude intrusion into the lives of civil service chiefs after a decade in which they got used to getting their own way.The absence of clear authority under May, and before that the many tensions and fractures of the coalition years, offered plenty of opportunity for determined mandarins to manage things just as they liked. No longer.Second, because the days in which the civil service was truly neutral, from top to bottom, have sadly ended — and a troubling number of officials seem to feel it is their role to promote a particular view.Brexit has exposed that bias. In the referendum campaign, public bodies which should know better allowed themselves to be used to pump out Remain propaganda, damaging their reputations.The agenda — to try to delay, disrupt and deny Brexit — was obvious. The election result has at last convinced all but the most diehard EU fans that we really are going to leave.But this is not the only issue on which the Government and parts of officialdom disagree.From Michael Gove’s criticism of experts, to Downing Street’s belief that Whitehall is overdue for radical restructuring and reform, there are changes on the way which will disrupt a state of affairs that rather suited a lot of senior people.If the New Year sees whole departments abolished or merged, and a new culture of ministers challenging the sacred cows of Whitehall thinking, then the machine will fight back, hoping to undermine change and keep things the same. There are three ways for ministers and their advisers to defend against that assault.First, steel themselves for a bumpy ride. They’ll be briefed against by past masters of the targeted Whitehall leak who have little to lose. They must not let themselves be knocked off course.Second, they must find allies. For every hidebound part of the civil service, there are others chafing to see things done better. Bring them on board.Third, they should make full use of their power to make public appointments.Labour stuffed the ious quangos and commissions with like-minded people, with similar principles and priorities.Why wouldn’t they  It would be bizarre for a government to appoint its opponents to wield state power against its agenda.And yet that is exactly what the Tories have too often done, apparently through a misguided sense of fair play.It’s time to realise that the other side neverthe favour. Boris and his team know that the election was the start, not the end, of their job.They have to deliver the change that they promised, to fulfil the trust voters put in them. There are battles ahead to make that happen, and wrestling Whitehall will be one of the biggest. Christmas truce will not last long.THE anti-democratic effort to block Brexit cost time, but it also cost money.Fine, ious big businesses might prefer we had voted Remain.But we didn’t.After the referendum, the private sector stood ready to do what it does best: Adapt and get on with le.But what businesses really dislike is not change so much as uncertainty.And Parliament made uncertainty an art form in the past three years.Now that we’ve got a new deal, a new Commons and a new Government, we should see new investment unlocked.Including money and decisions which were shelved during all the political hurly-burly.Let’s get Brexit done, and get Britain booming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just before we say goodbye to this year, I’ve been thinking about all the brilliant women who did brave, groundbreaking and seriously inspiring things in .Here, in no particular order, are my pick of those who really stood out — and hopefully will continue to do so for some time to come.It’s been a very mixed year for her. The country has had a tumultuous time, going to the polls and with two Prime Ministers.Her grandsons were apparently feuding and she had to be seen to be laying down the law to Prince Andrew.History may well judge  as her second annus horribilis.Yet somehow, this amazing woman has been the very definition of a dignied, strong and steady leader, offering us the stability and reassurance we as a country so desperately need.Yes, I know women’s football has been going on for years.But  was the year our Lionesses put it firmly on the map.Not only that, they have also inspired a generation of girls to get their boots on and play, knowing they can be just as good as boys on the pitch.So although it’s a shame it’s taken this long, we all owe them a debt of gratitude.I have long admired Emily for asking the hard questions on BBC’s Newsnight.But this year, in the face of the extreme hotting-up of Brexit, culminating in December’s General Election, her coverage has been second to none .Then her grilling of Prince Andrew in November was a masterclass in conducting a good interview — clinical, forensic and meticulous, without a hint of deference.Never shouty or confrontational, she gave Andrew the space to show himself to the public so they could make up their own minds about his culpability in his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.She also somehow managed not to make herself the storyalthough when Prince Andrew described Epstein’s actions as “unbecoming”, she took the chance to look as disgusted as we all feel.“Unbecoming ” she said. “He was a sex offender.”In short, she nailed him.That photo of her wearing the world’s most beautul dress, martini and cigarette in hand at the Emmys after-party, said it all.Earlier in the night she had won three of the four Emmys she was up for — just more in a long line of awards and accolades this year, during which she proved the brilliance of Fleabag was not a one-off.Her sharp, witty and totally original writing on Killing Eve showed she is seriously clever as well as unbelievably glamorous.And her portrayal of women is original, transgressive and totally refreshing.No wonder she was drafted in to give her input and perspective on the next Bond movie.I have a feeling that in  we will realise Phoebe Waller-Bridge is only just getting started.She has had her first baby, conducted her first royal tour and guest edited Vogue. Oh, and she met Beyonce.All in all, not a bad year! She has also managed to consistently put on a brave and happy face while on the receiving end of more criticism than most of us could stand.But it is her le-long passion for and commitment to feminism I admire most.On International Women’s Day, she said: “Men can understand that they can be feminists,” and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them.As we know all too well, not everyone likes a strong woman. But because she is strong, my view is that she will win over her critics in the end.Leave it to the women to organise, unite and provide support to local women in their community and provide support for those affected by the terrible tragedy of the Grenfell fire.Their aim is to provide a networking  and discussion forums for women and arrange positive actions and initiatives that will help the community. But above all, they want to remember — which is why they organise a monthly silent walk in memory of their “lost angels”.My heart breaks for them that they have to do this.But what a brilliant reminder of the power of organisation and women coming together to support each other.Earlier this year, at an equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by the TV and radio presenter, Samira said she: “Could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work . . .“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”On behalf of every woman who has felt she should have said something, should have done something, should have spoken out, stood up or walked out when they knew they were being paid less than men in similar roles, but who felt they had no choice but to put up with it, I salute her.I also want to give a mention to the captain of the US women’s soccer team.Yes, she is a great player. But people have lined up to criticise her because she is another strong woman who seems genuinely not to care what people think of her and what she says.They describe her in the US as a “badass” and there is no doubt that she is outspoken on every issue going.But it is her ongoing campaign to normalise gay relationships in sport that really resonates with me.Working in a sport where no male has ever come out as gay while playing in the Premier League, it seems sad — and unacceptable — that people can’t be open about being gay.I think Megan is helping to change that, though.Asked in an interview how it felt to lead the US team, she replied: “Go gays!”She continued: “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team. It’s never been done before. Ever.”Could any collection of amazing women be complete without a mention of the -year-old schoolgirl who has started an international revolution Everything this young woman has done — and she has done more than anyone I can think of to raise awareness about the climate emergency — has been made so much more impressive because of her tenacity in the face of such extreme criticism.Most of the youngster’s critics seem to be men of a certain age who are, I guess, threatened by someone so young and female being so bold, opinionated and unconcerned about what they think.Amazingly, the insults and attacks seem only to have empowered her further and fuelled her determination to make the world listen to what we need to do to try to stop climate change in its tracks.A slip of a girl — and a teen at that — is changing the world.Bravely, and in the face of extreme confrontation at times, she has created a movement where millions around the world follow her and listen to her.She has turned down many accolades because she is not in it for the adulation. She really just wants to make change happen. Truly inspirational.A bit like female Prime Ministers, female newspaper editors are a rarer breed than male ones.Women have such an important role to play in journalism and in fighting for equality.And now, for the first time in  years, there will be a female editor of the Financial Times, which really is groundbreaking, given the paper has been such a bastion of male power for so long.Roula is going to do a magnicent job, not least because she is so focused on increasing newsroom ersity and attracting more female readers, which gives her an obvious spot among my Women of the Year.And a final mention must go to Dr Nyla Raja, purely for personal reasons.She has transformed my skin this year.Everyone needs a great facial and a little help . . . and boy, does she deliver!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Sun Online has gone to Buckingham Palace for further comment.Her Majesty is a huge polo fan, with her sons and grandsons all playing competitively.The Queens Cup is played every July in Windsor Great Park, at the Guards Polo Club - founded by Prince Philip.The club blamed financial loss last year on the tougher rules proposed by the government, with legal challenges started in .Sources claim a deal was cut by the Hurlingham Polo Association - which had begun legal proceedings - and the Home Office to allow  visas to be granted.A former official told the newspaper: It was clearly of great interest to the Palace, and that shaped the urgent nature of the response.It went above and beyond the usual deals cut with dferent special interest groups and sports.Home Secretary Priti Patel will be making a ruling within days over the relaxed visa arrangement - which polo sources say was always temporary and to allow for the sport to prepare - is due to expire next April.The Home Office said any announcement on the issue would be made in due course, but refused to comment on private conversations.Buckingham Palace this morning told the Sun Online it would not be commenting on the claims.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But round one of Labour’s Got Talent should be a simple quiz with a single question. Why did we lose  Unless contenders convince us they know why Labour crashed to our worst ­result since , they’ll never become Prime Minister. Because you can’t leadyou can’t listen. And what I heard on the doorstep was some pretty clear advice. Such was the demonisation of Jeremy Corbyn that hundreds of voters I met thought Labour’s leader was a ­communist terrorist sympathizer who wouldn’t push the nuclear button or sing the national anthem. So they voted for Boris Johnson – a man they thought a charlatan – because on balance they believed it was the more patriotic option. Here, then, is a lesson for Labour’s next leader.

They’re vicious, power hungry, always obsessing with prestige. Real patriotism is something . Because you can’t truly love your country unless you care for the people who live in it. What I see in my work ­collecting food for foodbanks or helping groups that feed the homeless is the gigantic seam of kindness that runs right through this country’s soul like words through a stick of rock. Think of the people honoured by the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain awards. They’re proper heroes. But real patriots want the best of Britain’s freedoms to be the rights of all, not some. That’s why trade ­unionists marched and suffragettes died. It’s why we founded the Labour Party and built the NHS.

Weaposve had one general election, two Prime Ministers, three parties for Chuka Umunna and four Brexit deadlines. Amid all the deeply serious news there have, inevitably, been some totally bizarre moments. From the Tory conference going into do you know who I am lockdown to, erm, Mark Francoisapos penis, there have been incidents weaposd rather simply forget. And thataposs not to mention Boris Johnson hiding in a fridge, James Brokenshireaposs two normal, double ovens or the epicbattle that is Lord Buckethead. Or, for that matter, the funny tinge that derailed Angela Smith. Here weaposve rounded up some of the most What The Flip moments in British politics in . A Tory MP was kicked out of the party conference in October after armed police were called to a totally unacceptable row. Sir Geoffrey Clton-Brown was sent home from the Manchester bash after a spat erupted with a female security guard - when he tried to bring his fiancee into a VIP lounge without the right pass. The incident on aposlaw and orderapos day led to the International Lounge being placed on lockdown for around  minutes. The Old Etonian,  - Treasurer of the  Committee of Tory MPs - later told thehe was mortied and said he apologised unreservedly.   hours before the election, Boris Johnson retreated into a large fridge when a Good Morning Britain reporter ambushed him to ask him to appear on the show. One of the PMaposs aides could be seen mouthing aposoh for f***aposs sakeapos as the reporter approached the group while Mr Johnson joined an early morning milk round in Yorkshire. The Tory leader said Iaposll be with you in a second but walked off before ITV host Piers Morgan exclaimed heaposs gone into the fridge. A Tory source later stressed no one hid in a fridge. Mr Johnson later joked about the incident in a reception for Westminster journalists.  The Tory minister in charge of fixing Britain’s housing crisis was given a roasting for having FOUR ovens in his extravagant kitchen. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire also has two dishwashers. He admitted he and his we Cathy had the array of appliances installed because there was “not enough room” to cook for family occasions. A source close to Mr Brokenshire insisted he did not have four ovens, simply “two, normal double ovens.”  . When Dominic Raab turned to camera and proclaimed: aposFairnessapos Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab made perhaps the most naked bid weaposve ever seen to become a meme when he ran for the Tory leadership. His launch video began with a bizarre moment where Raab span a full  degrees on his heels to turn to the camera , before declaring: “Fairness!” The internet was gripped for days over what in Godaposs name he was looking at.  Weaposve all been there. First you dump your Labour Party after years of public fights. Then your Party tries to be all chummy like it never happened. Well, Chuka Umunnaaposs body language said it all on the BBCaposs Newsnight - where we witnessed an attempt at chumminess by Labouraposs Barry Gardiner. The Shadow Trade Secretary patted Mr Umunna, who quit Labour to form the Independent Group last week, on the arm. Nice man though he may be... Mr Gardiner declared. And Mr Umunna visibly stfened. . When aposBrexit hardmanapos Steve Baker quoted Paradise Lost and Soundgarden at the same time, at am No, we donapost know either. . When a Tory leadership candidate no one had heard of answered the question no one  thought to ask  Mark Harper was a   outsider for the Tory leadership who fell early in the race. But nobody really took advantage of the aposask me anything formatapos at his launch. So the Mirror decided to act. We asked the question the country needed an answer to. Who would win in a fight, a lion or a bear  Mr Harper, a former chief whip, thought for a moment - and then smartly said: On the basis that the lion is the symbol of Britain, Iaposm going to say the lion.  Author Will Self said every racist in the country probably voted for Brexit” in a bizarrely heated confrontation with Leave supporting Tory MP Mark Francois. The pairaposs cool glare at each other lit up the internet. Mr Francois later protested: Just before we began the interview he asked me a question about my genitalia. The guy was looking to wind me up. He definitely wanted an argument. Comedian Grace Campbell, who was on the show that day, claimed Self told Francois he had a little penis.  Donald Trump was the topic of conversation for a group of grinning world leaders who were caught mocking the President at a Buckingham Palace reception in December. French President Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson , Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Dutch leader Mark Rutte came together for a cosy chat. Clearly unaware that they are being filmed, Johnson turns to his French counterpart and asks: Is that why you were late  “He was late because he takes a -minute press conference at the top,” Trudeau answers for him. . THAT aposfunny tingeapos moment  Former Labour MP Angela Smith, faced widespread condemnation after comments she made about skin colour in a discussion on Politics Live. The MP, who lost her seat after defecting to the Independent Group and then the Lib Dems, appeared to say: Itaposs not just about being black or a funny tinge...She then broke off and commented from the BAME community instead. She later said she made the accidental racist comment because she was very very tired.  Change UK, an offshoot from Labour and the Tories, was forced to change its name for a third time - after the threat of legal action by petitions website Change.org. The Independent Group of  MPs who had quit Labour and the Tories announced in March that they were becoming an official political party, with the name Change UK. The petition website Change.org swtly responded distancing themselves from the new party, and confirmed they were taking legal advice. Matters werenapost helped when Anna Soubry, one of the groupaposs MPs, then accidentally called the party Change.org in the House of Commons chamber. To avoid getting sued, the MPs changed their name to The Independent Group for Change. Appropriately, they were wound up just before  came to an end.  The man who stood as aposLord Bucketheadapos in the  general election changed his name - and took on Boris Johnson in the  election. Comedian Jon Harvey, , from Lewisham, south east London, won  votes against the Prime Minister in Uxbridge and South Ruislip as Count Binface. He said he decided to drop the Buckethead name, which originated from a cult  US film called Hyperspace, after atussle with the filmaposs creator. So imagine his horror when he discovered the Monster Raving Loony Party candidate decided to call himself Lord Buckethead too... and won a more sizeable  votes.  During the Tory leadership race, Boris Johnson revealed he spends his spare time making model buses out of wine boxes. In a bizarre moment during a radio interview, the Tory PM hopeful went on atabout how he relaxes by crafting large replicas of London buses. He explained that he takes wine crates, paints them red and adds paintings of people inside the buses, enjoying themselves. He told TalkRadioaposs Ross Kempsell: I like to paint or I make things. I make, I have a thing where I make models of... When I was mayor of London... I make, buses. I make models of buses.  A viral hoax screenshot, purporting to be from the Mirror website, claimed the Lib Dem leader could be clearly seen loading a slingshot with stones and firing them at animals in a  clip. The entirely invented and Photoshopped story claimed Ms Swinson branded the animals pleb bunnies and said I donapost go for the head because thataposs too clean a death. A baffled Ms Swinson told LBC: Theyaposre quite sophisticated and people do believe them. I do think itaposs worrying because it echoes what weaposve seen in other elections and particularly when you think about fake news and the technological possibility for deepfakes where videos can be faked. Then there are questions about the role of publishers in circulating these things that arenapost true. Itaposs very dficult to prevent its spread.  . When Michael Gove tried to replace an ice sculpture with himself, but lost, oh and also Boris Johnsonaposs dad was there Top Tory Michael Gove turned up to the Channel  headquarters after it unveiled a slowly dripping ice sculpture to replace Boris Johnson in a general election climate debate. The pushy Cabinet Office minister tried to get on the show himself - but was told no, because it was only for party leaders. Bizarrely, Tory chiefs were forced to deny Boris Johnson had sent his own dad to defend himself after Mr Gove turned up with -year-old Stanley. In chaotic scenes Mr Gove was also confronted by a -year-old climate striker. His party later took the case to Ofcom but the complaint was not upheld.  A Tory candidate was caught getting his friend to act as a aposswing voterapos by TV journalist Michael Crick. Lee Anderson, who has now ousted Labour to become MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, was trying to impress the rottweiler journalist when he called up his pal to help him. Not realising he was still wearing a mic, he was recorded saying: Donapost make out that you donapost know who I am... you know Iaposm the candidate, but not a friend, alright  He told him what to do when they arrived and minutes later Mr Anderson he brought the journalist to his palaposs door. .

The group called for a fundamental change in leadership and unflinching review of what went wrong after Labour won  seats, the partyaposs worst performance since .In a letter to the Observer, they argued poorer voters turned Tory after they simply didn’t believe Labouraposs vast spending plans, or didnapost see the relevance to their lives. The ex-MPs also claim voters turned against Mr Corbynaposs reflexive anti-western worldview, adding: Cronyism at the top of our party and repeated unwillingness to stand up to the stain of antisemitism were constantly relayed back to us on the doorstep, shaming the traditional values of our once great anti-racist party. It comes as rumours swirl that left-wing party chair and Corbyn loyalist Ian Lavery could throw his hat into the leadership race - which kicks off on January . Jeremy Corbyn allies have for weeks been tipping Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey as the successor to continue his left-wing, nationalisation-focused legacy.But a source close to Mr Lavery refuse to rule out that he could stand too. The Sunday Times reported that concerns were raised about Ms Long-Baileyaposs heft and profile in a meeting of left-wingers before Christmas. Those signing todayaposs letter include Mary Creagh, who had chaired the Commons Environment committee, Phil Wilson who sat in Tony Blairaposs old seat, and Anna Turley whose Redcar seat was taken by a -year-old Tory. Also signing the letter were four Labour candidates who failed to become MPs.  They wrote: We lost seats in every region and nation with a swing against us in every social class – with the biggest swing against us from the poorest people. The scale of this defeat means that we have to look unflinchingly at what went wrong, way beyond a simple review, welcome as that might be. We need to be honest about why our outgoing leadership’s reflexive anti-western worldview was so unpopular and address the reasons. Mary Creagh, former MP for Wakefield Emma Reynolds, former MP for Wolverhampton North East Anna Turley, former MP for Redcar Dr Paul Williams, former MP for Stockton South Gerard Killen, former MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West Martin Whitfield, former MP for East Lothian Phil Wilson, former MP for Sedgefield They added: Labour needs to be in government – and for that, fundamental change at the top of our party is required. Only this will help us recover from the catastrophic loss of  December. Writing in the Sunday Times today, Jewish Leadership Council chairman Jonathan Goldstein welcomed the fact that Labour paid a price for its pact with racism. He added: But Labouraposs election defeat, its origins and its consequences are not the fault of British Jews, as I am sure that any real evaluation will show. Mr Goldstein said it is the Labour Party that left us and failed to engage meaningfully with the Jewish Labour Movement over cases of anti-Semitism, including in the ruling NEC. He called for a new leader to tear up the  Chakrabarti report, which concluded Labour was not overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism put an independent disciplinary process in place and ban groups or unions still denying anti-Semitism. And he said the new leader must have the will to take on Unite, which has been part of the problem and is unlikely to be part of the solution under Len McCluskey.

Runners and riders have been jostling to make their vision heard as they prepare to face off in a contest that will define the future of the Labour Party. Who wins will be defined by Labouraposs ,-ish members - many of whom flocked into the party after  to support Jeremy Corbyn and his left-wing agenda. Long time ally Rebecca Long-Bailey is seen as the aposcontinuityapos candidate to carry Mr Corbynaposs torch - but some in the party fear she wonapost make enough of a splash. Remainers Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer have declared their intentions while Wiganaposs Lisa Nandy, a backbencher who warned for years that Labour could lose northern heartlands over Brexit, is also in the frame. A new leader should be in place by the end of March. Here are all the candidates and potential candidates so far. How and when is the new leader elected   The rules were changed in  to make it easier for a candidate to get on the ballot paper. Candidates now need the support of % of MPs and either % of constituency parties or % of affiliates . Labour Party members, affiliated trade union members andregistered supporters who sign up for £ are then able to vote for anyone who makes the shortlist. Itaposs a one-member or one-affiliate, one-vote system - not the complex blocs of the past. There will be a aposfreeze dateapos, after which any new joiners cannot take part in the leadership election. This is designed to stop a sudden influx of aposentryistsapos backing a certain candidate. Itaposs thought this could be at the middle or end of January.Runners, riders and betting odds Declared or almost declared KEIR STARMER,  -   Holborn  St Pancras  PROFILE: The favourite in internal polls of Labour party members - and is popular among the broader public with Tories privately admitting they’d rather he didn’t get the job. While the shadow Brexit Secretary’s Remain inclinations will no longer be a problem, being a North London man might be. He’s not a union man, but has their respect, and has an impressive CV as he was Director of Public Prosecutions before becoming an MP in . His seriousness and intellect help at the despatch box, but he could do with sometimes showing his lighter side. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He warned the party must not oversteer back to the centre. He said: The case for a radical Labour government has never been stronger”. And he called for the party to take on the narrative that Boris Johnson can aposget Brexit doneapos by the end of January.  LISA NANDY,  -   Wigan  PROFILE: The eloquent backbencher was first elected to Parliament in  having worked for homelessness charity Centrepoint and then as senior policy adviser at The Children’s Society. She has been credited as one of the Labour MPs who “gets it” over Brexit, understanding why many Labour supporters in her Greater Manchester seat backed Leave. The half-Indian politician is a member of the Centre for Towns think tank. She quit the frontbench in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum and her attempts to try to break the Brexit deadlock won her plaudits on all sides of the Commons. Her links with powerful Union unite could help any run. Has hinted at a joint bid with David Lammy. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She argued Labour is facing the last chance to save itself as a whole, not from warring factions, and win back older and working-class voters. Itaposs about whether that traditional coalition that has propelled us into power three times in the last  years can hold good, and whether we can speak for both Lewisham and Leigh.  PROFILE: Yvette Cooper saw her odds slashed from   to   after she said she was considering throwing her hat into the ring. She is seen as a competent politician having chaired the Home Affairs Select Committee and with respect from MPs from the parliament. But four years ago she lost to Jeremy Corbyn . The former Cabinet minister who came second in the contest in  winning % of the vote compared to Mr Corbynaposs % said she would decide over Christmas whether to enter the race. Ms Cooper, who saw her majority in Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford slashed from , to , last week, said the party needed to move away from the politics of both Mr Corbyn and Mr Blairit was to win back the support of patriotic older voters who abandoned it for the Tories. We cannot just become a party that is concentrated in cities, with our support increasingly concentrated in erse, young, fast-moving areas while older voters in towns think we arenapost listening to them, WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She said both the left and right of the party are seen as internationalist rather than patriotic and Labour mustto its support in towns and former heartlands, not just the erse young fast-moving cities in England. CLIVE LEWIS,  -   Norwich South   PROFILE: A former BBC correspondent Mr Lewis has straddled the ide in the Labour party between Corbynistas and more moderate MPs. He resigned as shadow Defence Secretary after attempts by Mr Corbyn’s office to water down the party’s support for Trident. But the Norwich South MP has also been a vocal supporter of many of the soon to be ex-Labour leader’s policies. Despite being a confident media performer, his profile has been diminished since he left the Shadow Cabinet. And his compromise position means he hasn’t endeared himself to loyalists on either side of the party’s left right ide - meaning he may struggle to pick up support. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He called for the party membership to be given more powers than they were under Corbyn, backed proportional representation and said Labouraposs indecisiveness over Brexit hurt them. In contrast with most current analysis he suggested that the party had still not gone far enough to break with the Blair and Brown era.  EMILY THORNBERRY,  -   Islington South  Finsbury  PROFILE: An impressive performer - both in front of crowds and on the media. The shadow foreign secretary is a quick thinker, belly-laugh funny and has experience of going up against Boris Johnson at the despatch box. But she quit the frontbench in  after being accused of snobbery by tweeting a picture of a house decked out in St George’s flags, with a white van parked outside. And there are concerns another leader from Islington might not be the answer Labour is looking for. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She stood by her decision to back a second Brexit referendum, saying Jeremy Corbyn was let down and badly advised by top aides. She also called for the New Year Honours to extend to the dead and said she will promise to quit as leader before an electionthe polls and opinion show she canapost win.  Tipped to run REBECCA LONG-BAILEY,  -   Salford  Eccles  PROFILE: John McDonnell’s and other Corbyn alliesapos preferred successor for Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow chancellor has been grooming her for the top job. The shadow business secretary’s quiet demeanour belies a fiery passion for addressing social justice. Laura Pidcock’s failure to win a seat has cleared the way for her to be the candidate of the Left, although friends say she is not yet sure she even wants to go for it. If she decides to, then she could have the support of the powerful Unite as she has strong links with the union. JESS PHILLIPS,  -   Birmingham Yardley  PROFILE: The powerful voice is one of Labour’s strongest media performers who has the ability to speak “human” and the ability to tack between funny quips and powerful speeches. She is the chair of Labour’s women’s PLP and has been a strong supporter of all-women shortlists - perhaps suggesting she could push for them to be extended to the leadership race. But as she admitted herself on election night, the leadership race is “more than just a personality game and I know that people like me because I have a personality, and that will never just be enough.” DAN JARVIS,  -   Barnsley Central  PROFILE: The state-educated son of a lecturer and probation officer went to Sandhurst and served in the Parachute Regiment in Kosovo, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, rising to the rank of Major. He resigned from the Army to fight and win a by-election in . Despite being tipped for stardom in the days of Ed Miliband, heaposs had a very low profile under Jeremy Corbyn - even though he is juggling two elected offices, as MP and Mayor for the Sheffield City region. DAVID LAMMY,  -   Tottenham  PROFILE: The campaigner first entered Parliament in  and served in Tony Blair’s government but failed to be promoted. But he showed he can shape-sht politically after keeping out of many of the factional battles that have rocked Labour since . Instead the ardent Remainer - who also ran for the London mayoral nomination in  - devoted himself to highlighting the Windrush scandal and campaigning against Brexit. Mr Lammy, who would be Labour’s first black leader, may bridge the class ide at the heart of Labour’s woes. He grew up in Tottenham and lost a friend in Grenfell but also studied at Hard and became a barrister. But his outspoken opinions on social media - such as criticising the “white saviour” approach of Comic Relief - have prompted rows in the past. IAN LAVERY,  Wansbeck  PROFILE: The left-wing ex-miner was politicised by the s Strike and is a loyalist to Jeremy Corbyn, not to mention a tub-thumping anti-Tory rottweiler. As party chairman and joint election co-ordinator, he was one of the few in Shadow Cabinet to steadfastly back leaving the EU after the referendum to honour the  vote, including by many in his constituency. The dad-of-two and football, cricket and boxing fanaposs style and politics have sometimes led to clashes with Labouraposs more centrist MPs. Meanwhile, he has been dogged by stories over recent years about money he received from a local union he used to run, including just under £, in termination payments. a Certication Office report decided not to investigate further. He was not tipped for the leadership at first, but jitters over Rebecca Long-Bailey prompted rumours he could stand as an alternative left slate candidate.

Mr Evans said: “She says quite simply the incident terried her. She had a panic attack as she was watching the footage. This is not the first time she has been burgled. “She has two young children. She is pregnant. The fireworks needed replacing as they were for a New Year’s Eve celebration. “She will be moving address to a more secure property. She has an autistic son who is fully aware of what took place and he is having dficulty coming to terms with those events. “She herself has mental health challenges and they are made worse by having experienced this burglary.”  Smith also appeared in the dock to be sentenced for three counts of theft that he carried out at Applegreen Service Station in Hedon. The first offence took place on May  where Smith was spotted walking out carrying a display stand of electronic devices, taking a total of £. worth of items. On October , Smith stole £ worth of food from the same garage before ing to steal a box of chocolates worth £ on November . He also appeared in court for one count of interfering with a motor vehicle on October . Defence barrister Mark Savage told the court that the cause of Smith’s offending was down to his addiction to cocaine and that he now has a fear of the effects of the drug after seeing first-hand what it can cause. Mr Savage said: “He has looked at others around him who were much more addicted to the drug than he and it is fair to say it terries him. “There is no doubt that on his behalf and that the revulsion of his actions in realising there were children in that property. He says ‘I am disgusted with myself’. “His remorse is sincere but the commitment he has shown since in prison and the fear of others in prison has hit him hard. “He knows he is before the courts to be punished. He accepts he has to be responsible for his actions.

The Vicar of Dibley star, , wore a pink coat with the hood up on the stroll near her £million home in Fowey, Cornwall. No doubt her thoughts were also clouded by the court case facing daughter Billie Henry, , whom she and ex-husband Sir Lenny Henry adopted as a baby. Billie is due back in court in the New Year having been charged with harassing her former boyfriend Samuel King. She denied the charge. Dawn’s businessman husband Mark Bignell sat in the public gallery to support Billie for the five-minute court hearing earlier this month in Bodmin, Cornwall.  Neither Dawn or Billie’s dad, the comedian Lenny Henry, to whom Dawn was married for  years, was present. But the case was referred to the Crown Court for trial after Ms Henry pleaded not guilty to a charge of repeatedly or continuously engaging in controlling or coercive behaviour. Henry is alleged to have sent an excessive number of text messages demanding attention, and sent emails and text messages pretending they were from someone .  Sheaposs also alleged to have claimed she was subjected to sexual abuse and physical violence by King while they were in an intimate relationship. Prosecutor Paul Gallagher told the court: It is a complex case that involves a large number of downloads.

Bath resident Jo Macphersonaposs excitement at eating at The Bathampton Mill on Christmas Day soon turned to dismay. She claims her partner Simon Wright, , his mum Beryl Wright, , and his daughter Harriet Wright, eight, were booked in for .pm but had to wait an hour before their first course arrived on Christmas day. Jo, , claimed the service and kitchen staff were arguing with one another, one waitress was aposvery rudeapos to them and they were so fed up that they left at .pm. Bathampton Mill has apologised to the family over their experience and said they gave them a full refund, Somerset Live reports.  But she told of how unimpressed the family was after looking forward to their Christmas meal. Instead of enjoying a five-course meal together at the restaurant, they found themselves back at Mr Wrightaposs home thoroughly dejected, and sharing a meal of frozen pizza, cheese and crackers, as that was the only food left. Jo said: It was nothing short of a disaster due to lack of staff and organisation. It also seemed the service staff were arguing with the kitchen staff. I was told by the waitress, who was actually very rude, when we complained about poor slow service, menu changes and a cancelled amuse-bouche. She stated that she was not happy either as she could be at home with her family enjoying Xmas. She obviously didn’t want to work on Christmas day.This was not an isolated incident.  Other guests arriving for the .pm sitting were also complaining, some worse off than us, waiting up to  minutesfor their table which should have been available from .pm. We were the first to complain and demand a refund , which we received without hesitation. I feel they were happy to see us leave as we started other complaints demanding full refunds, from more polite guests.I went home to a meal of cheese and crackers and a frozen pizza. Not what I’d expect on Christmas Day. It was the worst Christmas I’ve ever had!I was a regular visitor but the service has always been poor with staff shortages. I assumed this would not happen on Christmas day. I was very wrong. Jo vows she will neverthere after this experience.  She said: It is such a shame because we have been regulars. We used to go twice a month, she said. We recommended this place to lots of people but now we feel stupid. It ruined our Christmas Day. When we got there, they were clearly short-staffed and those that were there were very stressed. The manager wasnapost visible at all. There was a queue of people waiting for ages. We had to wait  minutes for a bottle of wine. We eventually got it after I went up to the bar to get it. We waited an hour for our first course, one of which was a course we did not order. At .pm we had had enough. My partner wanted his money back. He was polite, quite forceful but not rude. Everyone was watching and looking at us. Jo was surprised they received a refund after the dire experience they said they endured. For the price we paid, you expect good treatment, she said. We asked for the refund and we got it. I was a little surprised that we did. When we went up and complained people were applauding us for doing it. Some said aposwell doneapos to him. We will never go back there. It is such a shame because it is a lovely spot in a beautul place and it has a lot of potential. It needs to be managed properly and they need more staff. To come home to some frozen pizza, cheese and crackers was a real let down. We had purposefully not bought much because we had the dinner to look forward to, so that is all we had left. But tonight we are using the refunded money to have a meal with all of us at the Aqua restaurant in Bath, so that should be good. I just hope others donapost have the same bad experience as we had. Mr Wright wrote a scathing one-star review on TripAdvisor after his meal there.

Dawn was told she had just  months to live, a devastating blow to her family as her ex-husband Iain, the father of her children, battled the fatal neurodegenerative Huntington’s disease, WalesOnline reports. But she is still alive and fighting the disease almost three years on. Herto work was dficult and there have been times when she has been very unwell, including when she suffered kidney failure. Dawn, mum to daughters Imogen, , and Madeleine, , said: I was really, really poorly. They took me off chemotherapy for about a year.

She added: I feel very fortunate to have had an opportunity like this - that they are mindful of my situation but recognise that I have a lot to offer the profession and students. I love to teach. One of the hardest things for me during my diagnosis was not being able to teach. The staff are brilliant and the kids are wonderful. Itaposs been wonderful from the start.

The Duchess of Sussex’s mum Doria, , is joining the royal trio – along with a royal protection team, who are staying in a cottage in the grounds. The property is believed to be owned by a powerful Russian businessman who is so secretive that he insisted the estate agent handling his purchase sign a non-disclosure agreement. And it has everything a modern royal could desire – the gourmet kitchen is fitted with a top-of-the-range pizza oven, perfect for Harry, who has spoken of his love for a deep dish and thin crust. One local, who runs a deli close to the sprawling home in British Columbia, told the Sunday Mirror: “We know that it’s owned by a Russian businessman, but he’s never around.” Another told us: “It’s an incredible property, and one of the most prestigious around here. “I wasn’t surprised when I found out Harry and Meghan are staying there. It’s certainly fit for royalty.” The Sunday Mirror has decided not to reveal the location of the royal couple’s holiday home. Built just over a decade ago in several acres of manicured grounds, the estate was described by one previous visitor as “a sanctuary” rather than simply a home. The rooms of the main house alone cover more than , sq ft – almost half as big again as Love Island’s summer complex on Majorca. As well as a wealth of opulent bedrooms, multiple bathrooms and a formal dining room, it has a games room with wet bar, a media room and even a wine-tasting room. The two-storey living room has spectacular sunset views looking across a magnicent stretch of water. And despite being relatively new, there is even a th century French fireplace imported specially from Europe. The guest cottage in the grounds adds more than , sq ft of indoor space, and there is also a luxury summer house. The Duke and Duchess, celebrating seven-month-old Archie’s first Christmas, are understood to have arrived at the property  days ago and are expected to stay until Friday.The region on Canada’s west coast was a favourite of Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, who admired its rugged beauty. But despite their luxury accommodation, Harry, , and Meghan, , ate out on Christmas Day – taking a private suite at a nearby VIP resort, with caterers they hired just for the day. An insider at the upmarket retreat, where the eco-conscious couple were seen arriving in a parade of xs, said: “The high-end caterers were called in to supply the lunch, which included vegetarian options, right at the last minute. “There were  to  people in the suite, including their security detail. A fleet of SUVs was outside the resort, which the group had used, including Range Rovers.  “And as well as security from England, there were also members of the Royal ­Canadian Mounted Police there too.” The couple’s British security detail for the trip is paid for by the taxpayer. The source revealed that, during the lunch, talk had turned to how the group should go for afternoon tea at a hotel once visited by both Harry’s father, Prince Charles, and his grandmother, the Queen. The source added: “Harry and Meghan laughed about it. They wanted to go there, but it was thought to be too public at this time of year.” The couple had needed to change their Christmas Day plans at short notice after another restaurant turned down their reservation due to the tight security required.  And while Prince William, Kate and their eldest children George, six, and Charlotte, four, greeted crowds at Sandringham on Christmas Day along with other Royals, Harry and Meghan were instead spotted taking Archie for a quiet family stroll in nearby parkland. A dog walker who passed them said: “I saw them on one of the trails. They were with three security men. I saw the security men first – I just thought to myself how unusual it was.” It is unclear who footed the bill for the Christmas Day lunch, or who is paying for the couple’s luxury stay – estimated to cost as much as £, a month.

When we flush the toilet, have a shower or use the washing machine the contents simply disappear - and itaposs easy to just forget about it. But the waste has to go somewhere- which means itaposs someoneaposs job to take care of your business. And then there is the smell.The staff at Severn Trentaposs sewage works, gave a Leicestershire Live reporting crew a tour of the site to demysty the question of where our everyday waste ends up - and who has to deal with it.At the Wanlip Water Treatment Works, site and sewage treatment veteran Dylan Thorley led a tour of the works, offering up his two decades of insight into the industry. Surprisingly the smell only reached us as we passed the point that sewage first enters the site, apart from that the air smelled the same as anywhere not a little eggy. He carries around a gas protector with him, warning that it goes off and he starts running- then we should too. With that in mind, we ventured to our first stop: the preliminary stage of the fascinating sewage treatment process. Workers have found wedding rings, wallets and moneyThis is the point where the sewage from the Rothley line and the  Leicester City  line first enters the site.Here, the smell is horrendous, after all it is , litres of raw sewage making its way into the plant every second. There was nothing comparable to the stench. Mr Thorley, however, didnapost flinch and claimed that the  years of being in the business had hardened him to the smell and he just didnapost notice it that much anymore. The sewage is not just made up of human excrement as many might think, indeed a lot of it comes from showers, washing machines and rain, grey water as Mr Thorley described it. At this stage aposragapos is separated from the water by four conveyor belts. The aposragapos made up of things like toilet paper and large objects thrown up by the sewage line is then compacted and pushed out of pipes resembling huge cigars. When the aposragapos reaches the end of the pipe it drops off just like ash from a burning cigar.  Left on the floor is essentially a pile of steaming toilet paper amongst lots of other solid debris removed from the sewage - Mr Thorley said that one of his workers once found £ in notes at this stage whilst on sht. Workers have also found wedding rings, wallets and driving licences that have made their way to the works. Rag is one of our biggest problems, not everything can be flushed, or put down the sink, he explained. Andanything happens to our machines or blocks the network we have to get in their and clean it out, itaposs not the nicest thing. The rag is collected in skips and taken off to landfill, another reason why people should use biodegradable products added Mr Thorley.  Mounds of sweetcorn and grit Next, but still part of the preliminary stage, finer solids that have escaped the first part are picked up. Again, this is to remove things that could potentially cause machinery to clog up or mal but also to remove solids from the water. Amongst the debris are all kinds of grit which is extracted and piled into mounds before itaposs recycled to be used in the making roads, for example. Looking at these mounds the first thing you notice are little yellow dots amongst the mostly black grit. What are they  Sweet corn, thousands of little kernels which cannot be broken down by the human body during the digestion phase. After the mounds of sweet corn and grit are removed the water moves on to giant rectangular pools called primary settling tanks.  aposI put all my cooking waste in a jarapos Looking into these pools you can still see some of the fat and impurities within the water. This is a big issue says Mr Thorley, because like aposragapos the machinery can be clogged up by grease and fat. I put all my cooking waste in a jar and wait for it to go hard, then I bin it. I donapost want to block my sewer up or the networks with fat traps, and at this time of the year the temperature is cooler so everything solidies quicker he said. This stage is also where apossludgeapos is removed using scrapers which move along the bottom of the pool. That sludge is then carried to the end of the tank where pumps extract it and send it onwards to the sludge treatment process. The liquid left behind, goes over the edge of the pool and onto the secondary stage.  The second process the sewage goes through is equally as important. Up until this point there had been a particularly unpleasant smell. As we walk up to the third stage in the process you can here a whirring of machinery. The pools here were built in  and are due for refurbishment, said Mr Thorley. No smell at all This stage is certainly the most spectacular, and itaposs important to note that none of the sewage has been touched by a single chemical by this point.  Itaposs known as an activated sludge plant and Mr Thorley said that itaposs at this stage that aposbugsapos are introduced which then feed on harmful bacteria within the water. The whirring that could be heard on approach was in fact multiple spinning metal stirrers which theatrically blend the brown and murky water with oxygen, creating a kind of tidal wave effect as it thrashes around. This process helps introduce oxygen into the water which in turn creates a healthy environment for the bugs to survive. And as we walked along the metal bridge over the whirlpool of sewage, careful not to get a splash of brown liquid to the face, there was no particular smell at all. In fact it smelled of nothing. After the bugs have worked their magic the water moves on to one of  circular shaped pools.  These pools are the final stage and are where the water that is left moves on to the river Soar, which is just behind the facility. Water is transparent When you compare the colour, smell and just complete repulsiveness of the raw sewage when it first enters the site to the water that is discharged into the river, itaposs worlds apart. Here, a small stream runs from the site towards the River Soar. Mr Thorley stands over it with a metal bucket.  Lowering it into the running water he pulls it up by a chain and pours it back. The water is transparent and looks like any water that you would see coming from a tap, although he suggested you would probably be best not to drink it. You would never believe that this water started off as raw sewage just a couple hundred metres away. In fact, Severn Trent maintain that the water that goes into the river is of better quality than what is already there. As mentioned in then primary stage, sludge is redirected towards sludge treatment plants.  These are huge drum like structures that store the sludge at C - the same temperature as a human stomach. This aids with the production of methane, which is then turned into energy that fuels four massive engines. aposSomeone has to do itapos Mr Thorley said that the whole facility uses about £, worth of electricity a month and these engines help to keep the facility somewhat self-sufficient. Severn Trent have also made a triple carbon pledge, which means that they hope to achieve zero emissions,  per cent renewable power and an all-electric fleet of vehicles by .

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

The weekend of the selection I was down in London with some friends, so when I got the call to say I had been picked it was a mixture of happiness and relief.‘On reflection, I thought I’d done well in the qualiers and I didn’t see any reason why I shouldn’t be selected.’And while feeling a little out of the loop with Scotland’s weekly training sessions since the qualying tournament, Liam has stayed World Cup-ready through his training and playing schedule at the prestigious Wellington School in Taunton, Somerset, where he also studies.He explained: ‘I can’t make training in Scotland as I’m down in Somerset, but I keep in touch with some of the players and coaches. There are new players training all the time and I was hoping my performances in the qualiers were going to be enough, so it felt great be selected.’After spending Christmas in Kintyre with his family, Liam can look forward to warmer climes next month, when he and the rest of the squad fine-tune their preparations at a training camp in Dubai, before flying on to South Africa, where Scotland will open their tournament against the cricketing might of Pakistan on January , before facing Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.The top two teams advance to the quarter finals, while the bottom two take part in an eight-team Plate section.Liam, who is the grandson of Douglas McKerral, of Meadows Avenue, said: ‘It’ll be crazy going from Christmastime in the west of Scotland to the Middle East for training in the space of five days, but it’s all really exciting.‘At the tournament itself, we’ll play Pakistan first, who have one player taking wickets in top-level test cricket against the likes of Australia and Sri Lanka, while Bangladesh are the top under-s side in the world. Zimbabwe are well known in cricket too.’The opposition will be tough but Liam is looking forward to the tournament, on both competitive and emotional levels.He added: ‘This is my biggest challenge yet – I’ll be playing against people I’ve seen on TV, the kind of thing you want to do growing up.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of organisations involved in business transport in Haddington and confirmed invitees include Haddington Business Community Partnership, Haddington Community Development Trust, East Coast Buses, Prentice

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

And when you hear their name mentioned, it still gives you that pit of the stomach dread and pain you felt asit were yesterday that you broke up. This song is about that. Wonderingthe other person still thinks about you too, or: Is It Just Me  Idlewild- Same Things Twice#The second taster from eighth album Interview Music was ato the fire-in-the-belly indie pop of their early period while addingsome subtle psychedelic textures.ldquoInterview Music was becoming quite erse while we were writing it, so when we started working with our old producer Dave Eringa, we thought wersquod try and write some songs that were a bit closer to what wersquod done in the past: big distortion pedals and anthemic choruses, saysRoddy Woomble. \"Same Things Twiceturned out to be a nice mix.

This is the first step towards bringing agricultural beasts back and using them to improve the conditions of the productive land on the island.As well as paving the way towards the reintroduction of farming activities, the cows presence is hoped to help boost bioersity and help support corncrakes and rare species such as the Slender Scotch Burnett Moth.Subtle signs of activity on Ulva come  months after the island celebrated a controversial pound. million community ownership deal largely funded by public money.Some argued it was a harsh day for the islandrsquos owner, Jamie Howard. Recently widowed and whose family had owned Ulva for three generations, his hope to sell to his preferred bidder was removed from his hands by Scottish Government community land reform rules.Others, however, embraced the move as a new dawn for an island which had suffered at the hands of th and th-century owners.In , the population of Ulva and neighbouring Gometra ndash attached by a narrow bridge ndash stood at . Within seven years it would slump to a mere  and by the s, Ulva, a favourite spot for Beatrix Potter, Sir Walter Scott and visited by James Boswell and Dr. Samuel Johnson, would have just seven families left, with crofts abandoned and properties in ruins.Since the change of ownership, however, interest has soared among people keen to visit and, perhaps surprisingly for a remote spot with no car ferry, school, shop or roads, to set up home.Recently a survey by the North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, which as a result of last yearrsquos community buyout owns Ulva, revealed its population could balloon by , per centall applications to become its newest residents were accepted.More than  people have lodged their interest in living on the island: a challenge, given there are currently just a handful of residential properties and no infrastructure other than a single restaurant ndash The Boathouse ndash to support them.There are, however, big plans. And the arrival of the Highland cattle, says Ms Reid, are just the start.By next summer, the six residential properties are expected to have been fully refurbished. The plan includes the restoration of a Thomas Telford-designed manse, built in the s and long abandoned, and there have been hints that its neighbouring church could one day become a music venue.Further ahead, there has been talk of a proper campsite, mini-hotel and hostel for tourists who want to extend their visit, an oyster farm and shops. Itrsquos been suggested that within a decade, Ulva could be home to at least  people, rising to  by .Certainly, there is a major rise in interest: visitor numbers have boomed from around , a year to over , over the course of the past year, raising questions over the tiny islandrsquos ability to cope with the additional footfall.ldquoThere has been a signicant increase in the numbers of people coming across to visit, says Ms Reid. ldquoIt will lead to pressure on infrastructure on the island, but we are working on a number of things to manage it and to give visitors a more erse experienceldquoWe are very aware of the impact of more visitors and we dont want the island to be overwhelmed.Those who made the short journey from Mull during recent weeks may have noticed subtle changes. For a start, volunteers have tackled the overgrown walled garden at Ulva House which, until the buyout, was the fine B-listed mansion home to the Howard family.Plans for the house are said to include refurbishing half to become a high-quality self-catering property which would fund the running of an interpretation and educational centre in the other half.Further plans are understood to focus on the development of infrastructure to support house plots for sale and self-build and for the construction of rented accommodation.If the cattlersquos recent arrival signies a giant leap towards theof an agricultural sector on the island, there is another sign of a new era.Sheila MacFadyen was a dairy maid for the Clark family, Ulvarsquos owners until the mid-th century. The last resident of a row of humble cottages, she left for Mull in the s.She died in , but her blackhouse remained to become a crucial part of island heritage and destination for visitors curious to discover more of the islandersrsquo basic way of le.Work on its restoration is now complete. Even \"Sheila\" ndash a mannequin which has sat huddled in a corner of the tiny home ndash has had a revamp, and become another highly visible sign of change on Ulva.ldquoThe mannequin had become quite spooky, she was looking tired and ragged, explains Ms Reid.ldquoWe have had a donation of Harris Tweed for a new skirt, and volunteers in Mull are giving her a bit of a new look. Once shersquos had her makeover, shersquoll sit at a spinning wheel that has been done up along with information boards and maps.Sheilarsquos Cottage, she adds, will remain at the heart of island le ndash a vital link with times gone by and a bright new future.ldquoThere has been a huge amount of effort behind the scenes, processes and paperwork and consultations that people canrsquot see.ldquoThe re-thatching of Sheilarsquos Cottage and the arrival of the Highland cows is very symbolic people can see things happening.ldquoWe are planning to announce a number of major plans in the new year.ldquoWe are on the cusp of a new start."},{"url":null,"title":"top-100-tunes-scotland-2019-part-4-25-1","story":"This best of Scottish soundtrack for  is an erse journey into hip hop, alternative, dance, house, electronica, indie, punk, post-grunge, post-rock, nu and old folk, even hints of classical and often a combination of some or all.Its a mix of the known, little known and the unknown, leftfield and mainstream, immediate pop anthems and challenging experimental projects.This list has been whittled down from a not very shortlist of nearly  compiled throughout the year.Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Part - - Nani - ControlAn immaculately executed and mesmerizing lo-fi sparce-electro first single from the exciting Edinburgh-based musician songstress recorded for a debut EP at Alison House Studios. \"I am an artist of some kind, becauseI dont call myself then no-one will,\" she says.

While Irsquom usually focused on the trail ahead and wide mountain views I also keep half an eye out for interesting plants and fungi, especially on the long, slow uphill section.ldquoI suppose I was secretly hoping for an excuse for a rest so was delighted when I spotted something a little dferent out of the corner of my eye.The naturalist said he had been inspired to find rare lichens by a project run by Kew gardens in London that aims to seek out unusual and undocumented fungi across the UK.There are an estimated . million species of fungi worldwide ndash and possibly millions more ndash but, because of their often remote habitats, gaining information on their whereabouts can be hard.The Kew Gardens scheme is a five-yearlong effort calling on scientists and the public to rediscover lost species, to look for rare ieties, revisit sites known from historical records for a fresh look, and survey plausible locations for new populations.It was with this in mind that Mr Genney managed to spot the crop of Multiclavula corynoides, despite its remote location.He said: ldquoI recognised it because the Kew Lost and Found Fungi project have been encouraging citizen scientists to look out for rare or under-recorded species.ldquoThey had highlighted a related lichen as one of their target species so things like this were on my radar.ldquoItrsquos always exciting to find something yoursquove never seen but for it to be a species that has never been seen in Britain before made my day.ldquoThe discovery fills a gap in our knowledge of the global distribution of this little fungus. Itrsquos also interesting that it was thriving on an old forestry road siding, demonstrating how nature can sometimes benefit from man-made habitats.ldquoIt just shows the importance of keeping your eyes peeled when yoursquore out and about enjoying the outdoors ndash you never know what you might discover.The discovery may be down to next yearrsquos autumn delivering perfect conditions for fungi to bloom.A damp end to the summer and a wet autumn created fertile ground for them, with some species which usually haunt dark corners being seen in the open.Gardeners at the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens and Partner Gardens have reported findings of unusual species, giant specimens and prolerations of ldquofairy rings made of red and white-spotted toadstools."},{"url":null,"title":"people-decade-20-movers-shakers-history-makers","story":"In , Time Magazine named its person of the year as \"the silence breakers\".

She may not have come up with the term Me Too ndash that was Tarana Burke back in . Nor was she the person to put the hashtag out into the ocean of social media ndash that was Alyssa Milano, her co-star from Charmed. But she made her mark as someone who would not be silenced. She has also claimed that she was the first person to out Weinstein.#MeToo was a cultural revolution and catharsis. Back in , when it broke, it felt asHollywood and the many fields where men were protected by their power and influence would never be the same again. In this revolution around what women should tolerate, who would be listened to, and what should be shamed, McGowan stood out. She wrote a memoir, Brave. She used her anger as a weapon.

It starred The Royle Familys Ralf Little alongside Haddington and Littles co-writer Michelle Terry. But it was another cast member, then an unknown -year-old actress, who particularly caught Haddingtons eye. \"I can remember looking at her,\" she said, \"and thinking: My God, what an extraordinary inidual.\" The inidual in question was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her first major role.Fast forward eight years and the London-born polymath has the world at her feet, particularly the part that houses the gilded constituencies that hand out Emmys and Golden Globes. The  Golden Globe ceremony is on January  in Beverly Hills and Waller-Bridge is up for two awards. Ten days later shell be honoured at the Screen Actors Guild Awards where shes nominated in two categories. Andshe flies home laden with mantelpiece accessories it wont be the first time ndash she scooped three Golden Globes at last years award as well as three Primetime Emmys.If not, well theres the not insignicant matter of the th James Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in April. Waller-Bridge co-wrote the script and great things are expected. Of coursetheres one production on which Waller-Bridges name is indelibly stamped its Fleabag, written by and starring her as a young Londoner navigating family, work, sex and relationships with brutal honesty and unsettling humour.Starting out as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Fringe, it was turned into a TV series in  but was dropped quietly onto BBC Three, then only available online. But word-of-mouth is still a powerful tool even in our digital age and by the summer it had been relaunched on BBC Four. The rest is television history: when we look back at this decades television, well be splitting it into pre and post-Fleabag.Even more interestingly, Waller-Bridge followed that triumph with one of the career curve-balls weve now come to expect: an adaptation of Luke Jenningss Villanelle spy novel series. Retitled Killing Eve it was fresh, funny, thrillingly violent and gratuitously fashion-forward, and made a star of lead actress Jodie Comer, whose pink Molly Godard tulle dress became the go-to Halloween costume for hipsters everywhere.

As only those from other small countries can appreciate ndash the Jamaicans and Swiss, perhaps ndash possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller.Thats exactly what Andy Murray has done for Scotland . Is there any feeling comparable to the buzz of watching Murray play a big match, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body  I think not.And yet the Dunblane-born champion is not only from Scotland, but very much of his homeland. During the late Noughties, the young, gangly, wild-haired Murray thrilled us with his impressive Wimbledon runs. But as the years went on and he just missed out on a slew of grand slam trophies, many English media outlets and tennis fans took against him, decrying the sweary intensity and dry Scottish banter. This only made Scots love him more, of course.Eventually, with patience, maturity, courage and sheer hard graft came the top honours in tennis ndash the US Open, two Wimbledon singles titles, two Olympic gold medals, the Davis Cup, the coveted world number one spot ndash and global adulation.But as much as he grew as a sportsman, whats equally remarkable about Murray is how he grew as person. Indeed, it is his openness, humanity and humility, the way he speaks out against sexism in tennis, that make him a true hero, loved by his peers and the public, rather than simply respected.A devastating hip injury ndash and subsequent resurfacing operation ndash nearly ended Murrays career, and his recent comeback has been both painful and inspiring to watch.Murray taught Scots to dream big. But the father of three also taught Scots men, in particular, showing your feelings, being true to yourself, makes you a bigger man in every way.MARIANNE TAYLORJEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEOThe worlds richest man is fond of reminding people that he started Amazon in his garage.

Amazon has transformed shopping, helped hollow out the high street, and led to a fortune for its creator estimated at poundbn.That has allowed him to set up his own space exploration company and buy the Washington Post .Bezoss success cant be gainsayed, but at what cost  Employees have bitterly complained about working conditions, the EU is investigating the company for anti-trust violations and earlier this year it had to scrap plans to build a second headquarters in New York when local politicians questioned why a company making bna month should receive taxpayers cash to move to the city.Oh yes, and it was also revealed that the company had not paid any income tax in the US the previous year. Or the year before that. You dont get to be the richest man in the world by giving anything away, obviously.TEDDY JAMIESONDAVID BOWIE, MUSICIANIn the months after his death at the start of , as Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, there was a spate of tweets wonderingBowies absence was now one of the reasons why everything was going to hell in a handcart.\"Im not saying that David Bowie was holding the fabric of the universe together, but *gestures broadly at everything*\" tweeted blogger Katie Liewy with tongue firmly in cheek in June that year.Whether his influence actually stretched that far, theres no doubt that culturally this decade was Bowies, in the same way as the s belonged to the Beatles. As Oasis looked to Lennon and McCartney in the mid-s, Bowie became the touchstone for any musician ndash from FKA Twigs to St Vincent ndash in the s who wanted to push the odd boundary.But none of them did it as well as the original, who ed at the start of , after almost a decade in which he had withdrawn from public view. He released a new single, Where Are We Now , on his birthday without any warning. It presaged a new album, The Next Day, and a VA retrospective, David Bowie Is. Three years later he released an album, Blackstar, on his th birthday. Two days later his death was announced. It was ashe was curating his own end.:From the death of Bowie to the rise of grime: The decade in pop musicFor anyone who knew him in the middle of the s the fact that Bowie avoided being a rock n roll casualty must have seemed a miracle given his copious drug intake back then.Instead, he weaned himself off them, created some of the most memorable and potent music of the late th century, reinvented himself as a mainstream pop star in the s, then became an elder statesman who embraced everything from drum n bass to the internet before his final st-century flourish.His is one of the great stories in pop and in  it came to a tragic yet magnicent conclusion.TEDDY JAMIESONELON MUSK, TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURThe chronicles of self-styled maverick billionaire Elon Musk never fail to fascinate. Among his outlandish adventures and madcap musings, we have Elon and the space car Elon and the Thai cave rescue Elon and the dead gorilla novelty rap Elon and his plan to nuke Mars.South African-born Musk first pricked the public consciousness as a technology entrepreneur, investor and engineer in  when, aged , he sold his web software company, Zip, to Compaq for  million .He continued to ascend his field throughout the Noughties, but it is in the last decade that Musk has become a household name for his roles as founder chief engineer designer of SpaceX and the CEO product architect at Tesla.Granted, this is often more down to calamity than plaudits for his innovative work. Such as the cringe-inducing moment during a recent unveiling for the new Tesla Cybertruck when, demonstrating how tough the \"armour glass\" of the windows was to break, they were duly smashed.Or when he referred to British er Vernon Unsworth ndash who helped rescue  Thai boys trapped in a flooded underwater cave in  ndash as \"pedo guy\" on Twitter .Then theres Musks lofty plans to \"nuke Mars\" ndash which he describes as \"a fixer upper of a planet\" ndash suggesting that nuclear bombs should be detonated at its poles to melt the ice caps and allow it to sufficiently heat up for humans to dwell there.And the head-scratching moment when he dropped a track on SoundCloud called RIP Harambe, a heavily auto-tuned song about the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla whose death in  sparked a global outpouring of grief and anger.Sure, Musk sometimes loses credibility due to his more leftfield thinking ndash such as a belief that were all probably living in a giant computer simulation like The Matrix or a Sims-style game controlled by superior beings ndash but there is no denying that hes a clever guy who shouldnt be underestimated.If this is a simulation, we cant wait to see what our overlords get him to do next.SUSAN SWARBRICKMEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEXSurely it wasnt meant to be like this. If you become a fairy tale princess can you not then expect to live happily ever after That hasnt been the case for Meghan Markle. Yes, she had the royal wedding last year attended by the great and the good and the merely famous. Yes, she got a title, a handsome prince and a royal baby . Not what she must have expected growing up a mixed-race kid in Los Angeles.And yet since the wedding there has found herself a constant target of the tabloid press. She recently filed a lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter to her estranged father. It also prompted her husband Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to condemn the medias \"relentless propaganda\" which was, he said, often \"knowingly  and malicious\" in a public statement announcing the legal action.His anger is perhaps understandable given the paparazzis involvement in the death of his mother. \"Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\" he admitted this year.The Duchess of Sussexs major crime would appear to be that she has \"opinions\". There is a class of media commentator ndash mouthy, reactionary and perhaps most importantly white ndash who is offended by her feminism and likes to moan about the couples \"wokeness\". It has prompted \"the Queen\", or, rather, the TV version of the monarch, Olivia Colman, star of The Crown, to speak out against the critics.:From Leonard Bernsteinrsquos MASS to the GRIT Orchestra, Keith Bruces musical picks of the decade\"I dont know why theyre so mean to a fellow human being,\" Coleman said of the press coverage.Or maybe we simply have to accept there is no such thing as happy ever after.TEDDY JAMIESONGRETA THUNBERG, ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER\"My name is Greta,\" a Swedish schoolgirl wrote on her flyers in . \"I am in ninth grade, and I am school-striking for the climate. Since you adults dont give a damn about my future, I wont either.\"Its hard to believe that it has only been just over a year since Thunberg ndash recognised now simply as \"Greta\" to millions ndash made her viral UN speech in Poland, saying, \"You say you love your children above all . And yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\"Thunberg may only have made her stamp in the final year of the decade, but at just  years old she has done more to provoke an attitude sht on environment than anyone, and she began it by skipping school.Her words and actions have woken millions of schoolchildren, four million of whom went on strike from school on September , as well as adults, to the science-backed threat of the climate emergency. On what is arguably the biggest issue of our time, hers is the voice that has led, upbraiding those in leadership. Margaret Atwood called her the Joan of Arc of environmentalism. Donald Trump told her to \"chill\". Collins Dictionary made \"climate strike\" its word of the year.Why did people listen to her, when others saying the same were ignored  Perhaps because of who she was ndash not an adult, scientist, politician or expert ndash and how she, a teenager with Aspergers Syndrome, delivered her message, politely, yet angrily and without softenings.To the UN General Assembly, in September, she said: \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\" She has started a powerful movement. The question is whether necessary change will follow. Can we alter the ending of this terrying nightmare  Thunberg dares us to.VICKY ALLANNICOLA STURGEON, FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLANDBy the time Nicola Sturgeon became Scotlands first female First Minister in , at the age of , she had already been involved in politics for more than a quarter of a century.She joined the SNP in her native Ayrshire ndash then a Labour bastion ndash aged  at the height of the Thatcher years. It was the decisive first step on a journey that would transform not only the young Sturgeon but the fortunes of her party, and, ultimately, the political landscape in Scotland.After becoming an MSP in , Sturgeon, a solicitor by trade, impressed from the outset, serving in two shadow cabinets. In , she was elected deputy party leader to Alex Salmond during his second stint as party leader. The partnership was successful and in  the SNP won a majority at Holyrood, paving the way for s independence referendum.When Salmond resigned as SNP leader and First Minister in the aftermath of the Yes campaigns loss, Sturgeon was the obvious choice to replace him.:From Frozen to  Years a Slave, the best films of the last  yearsThe five years since have seen tumultuous change in UK politics, with Sturgeon growing in stature as politician and stateswoman, both in UK and European terms, even in the eyes of many who do not share her stance on independence. She regularly appears in glossy magazine lists of the worlds most influential women.During the recent General Election campaign her clear opposition to Brexit and impressive performances in TV debates ndash not to mention her lively Twitter feed ndash won her a whole new legion of fans in England, particularly among women. Will Sturgeon lead Scotland to independence in the s  That remains to be seen. Regardless, her place in Scottish history, as politician and role model, is guaranteed.MARIANNE TAYLORBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESThings might look dferent now. In , at the end of Barack Obamas second term in office, when commentators looked back at his legacy as president, there was a sense that his achievements were, at best, mixed.True, he had withdrawn US soldiers from Iraq, improved relations with Cuba, reached a nuclear deal with Iran and introduced Obamacare.Set against that, though, he escalated American military involvement in Afghanistan, increased drone strikes in Pakistan, saw wealth and income inequality rocket under his watch. Guantanamo Bay was still in operation when he left office and though he spoke out in favour of gun control he didnt manage to introduce it.Obama could point to Republican obstruction in the House of Congress. Even so there was a whf of missed opportunities about his presidency. Perhaps that was inevitable. In the end a centrist president was never going to live up to the utopian notions so many Americans projected on to him during the  election campaign.And yet, in retrospect, perhaps his achievements are growing. What has been missed over the last four years is his articulacy, eloquence, wit and normality.In part its because he represents the antithesis of what came after. An inarticulate, narcissistic, racist, corrupt old man whose first term has been a skip fire of the vanities ending in a vote for impeachment. Obama for all his failings always felt like he was an adult in the room. Can you say the same of Donald Trump TEDDY JAMIESONKIM KARDASHIAN WEST, REALITY TV STAR AND ENTREPRENEURLove her or loathe her, there is no denying that Kim Kardashian West ripped up the rule book in her rise to becoming a world-famous reality star with a multi-million-dollar business empire and a global fanbase.Having first found peripheral fame as a friend and stylist to heiress Paris Hilton in the early s, Kardashian West gained notoriety after the release of her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray J in . That same year, the familys reality TV series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, began airing.While the naysayers reckoned it would be a fleeting  minutes of fame, Kardashian West pulled off a shrewd and unparalleled move: she utilised social media to make herself into a brand. Today, her Midas touch extends across fashion, fragrances and cosmetics to television, books, gaming, and even law and politics. Oh, and she is queen of the selfie.An exaggerated hourglass figure and cartoonishly large backside have become a trademark for Kardashian West, garnering as many ndash and often more ndash column inches as her entrepreneurial ventures.: The best visual arts of the last  years, by Jan Patience and Sarah Urwin JonesIndeed, when Kardashian West posed for a  cover of Paper magazine with her rear bared and oiled up like a Greek wrestler, it saw a new phrase \"break the internet\" coined, referring to the frenzy that the images sparked.That same year, she joined her husband, the rapper Kanye West, for a landmark cover on Vogue magazine. \"There are a lot of firsts,\" Kardashian West said at the time. \"Kanyes the first rapper to be on, Im the first reality person to be on, were the first interracial couple.\"She continues to surprise people. Earlier this year, Kardashian West announced she was following in her late fathers footsteps by studying to become a lawyer .Kardashian West ndash who boasts  million social media followers on Instagram alone ndash seems determined to use her  and stratospheric public profilefor good, visiting US president Donald Trump at the Oval Office last year to discuss justice reform.She successfully lobbied Trump to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, a -year-old woman who spent  years in an Alabama prison, without parole, for a non-violent, first-time drug offence. Johnson was released in  and Kardashian West has vowed to tackle other miscarriage of justices.Her work to date makes for impressive reading. But in the scheme of things, one could argue that Kardashian West is only just getting started. With her husband having announced he intends to run for US president in , a decade from now this might all seem like small fry.SUSAN SWARBRICKSTORMZY, RAPPERWhy is Stormzy one of the most influential public figures of the last decade  There are  people you could ask ndash  black students who were admitted to Cambridge University in . Thats up about  per cent more than the  who started courses in .Not all of it is down to Stormzy, but a lot of it may be. In , the grime artist announced he would be paying the tuition fees and maintenance grants of two black Cambridge students, and this year he said hed be paying for two more. Its called the Stormzy Scholarship and now theyre calling the rise in the number of black students at Cambridge the Stormzy Effect.The question is: can the effect spread  Theres still a huge gap between the chances of going to university in the UKyoure white and well-off and the chances of goingyoure black or youre poor or youre both and some argue universities will have to offer places to poorer students with lower grades to start making a dference. But the good news, thanks to Stormzy, is that black students now make up more than three per cent of new undergrads at Cambridge for the first time.Stormzy has had another effect too, and perhaps its one that will be even more profound. Rappers have traditionally had a bit of an image problem: theyve usually promoted out-of-school activities rather than in-school ones. But Stormzys dferent. \"It sounds corny coming from a rapper,\" he says, \"but I did love learning and I loved studying.\" The Stormzy Effect could inspire many others to feel the same.MARK SMITHSIMONE BILES, GYMNASTOnce in a letime ndashyoure very lucky ndash theres a sporting star who shines so brightly that they eclipse everything that has come before.Step forward Simone Biles. The US gymnasts talent and achievements are such that we humble observers have long since exhausted the superlatives.While the gymternet ndash as the online community of gymnastics fans are known ndash has been abuzz about Biles for years, it was at the Rio  Olympic Games that the rest of the world sat up and took notice.: From Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour to What Girls Are Made of, five standout theatre shows of the decadeBiles, who won four golds and a bronze, found herself repeatedly compared to a raft of male sporting greats asthat is the only way we could comprehend her colossal achievements. \"Im not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps,\" she responded. \"Im the first Simone Biles.\"The -year-old from Texas burst onto the global gymnastics scene in , winning her debut world all-around gold in Antwerp. It is a title that Biles has claimed on four further occasions , alongside a raft of inidual apparatus medals.In October, Biles took her th medal, making her the most decorated gymnast ndash male or female ndash in world championship history .But it is not only in a competition arena that Biles proved herself a gargantuan presence. In January , she released a statement on Twitter confirming that former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her under the guise of medical treatment.Nassar was later sentenced to up to  years in prison after more than  women stood up in court and laid bare their own experiences of sexual abuse in a scandal spanning three decades.Biles and her fellow survivors were awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. At the  US National Championships, she designed and wore a teal leotard ndash a colour used to raise awareness about sexual abuse.A vocal critic of the US Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for their response to the allegations against Nassar, Biles continues to lobby for better accountability from both governing bodies.She refuses to be defined by what happened. Biless willingness to push the boundaries of her sport remains unabated. At the  US Gymnastics Championships, she stepped out in a crystal-studded leotard bearing her surname above an embroidered image of a goats head.It was a nod to the acronym GOAT, which is shorthand for the Greatest of All Time. Far from being boastful, however, this was Biless tongue-in-cheek \"jab back\" at the \"haters\" .She has the goods to back it up. This year Biles had two gymnastics skills ndash a hugely dficult triple twisting-double somersault in her floor routine and double-double dismount from beam ndash named in her honour after she became the first woman to perform them. Both appear to defy gravity.The Tokyo  Olympic Games loom on the horizon. Simone Biles is far from done yet.SUSAN SWARBRICKABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADIHe was the most wanted terrorist in the world. For more than half of the last decade, no single figure caused more chaos in the Middle East than Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri. For that was his real name, even though the world came to know him by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.As the decade began al-Baghdadi had already served four years in the sprawling US military detention centre called Camp Bucca, which had detained some of the Iraq Wars most radical jihadists. In political and religious terms he was already a long way from his days as a PhD student of Islamic Studies at university in Baghdad.By , clad in black robes and standing in the pulpit of a mosque in Iraqs second city of Mosul, he was already claiming the title caliph of the Muslim world and leadership of the infamous Islamic Stategroup.Few even then could have imagined the chaos, carnage and suffering that al -Baghdadi, born one of six children in , would wreak on the world.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesIt would not be until October , , in a raid carried out by US Special Forces, when al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest in the Syrian province of Idlib, that the world was rid of his malign presence.\"We killed the last murderous bastard who ran IS, lets go get the next one,\" proclaimed one tough-talking US Republican Senator in the wake of al- Baghdadis death.But in the tunnels and booby traps left behind in cities like Mosul and Raqqa to the mass graves and thousands of faceless, black-clad female followers haunting refugee camps, ISs presence remains palpable along with its new new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.Many IS fighters now languish in prisons, but thousands more remain at large re-grouping and organising while their franchises likewise operate across the globe. This is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadis lingering and still menacing legacy.DAVID PRATT, CONTRIBUTING FOREIGN EDITORBOB SERVANT, BURGER TYCOONAh, Bob Servant. How do we love thee  Let us count the ways.

Public opinion has become ever more supportive. LGBT people have become ever more visible. And in , gay marriage was made legal in most of the UK.Then theres the T in LGBT. A few days ago, the Scottish Government published a draft bill which will simply the process of trans men and women having their gender legally recognised, but its not been an easy path. Some feminists say the legislation will undermine the rights of women. Trans activists say a change in the law is the only way to end the demeaning legal and medical process trans people currently have to endure. The two sides have not always been nice to each other.What the debate, and the bitterness, may prove is there is still some distance to go to LGBT equality, but the fact we got closer in the last decade is in large part due to its trans pioneers and one pioneer in particular. You know what Im talking about andnot, you should: the cover of Vanity Fair in June . Caitlyn Jenner. Former Olympic athlete. Openly transgender woman.For Jenner, the photograph was an act of happiness. \"Im so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self,\" she said when the magazine was published. \"Welcome to the world Caitlyn.\" And for those who saw the picture, it was an act of courage and activism. When is equality  When trans people are in parliaments, and in churches, and in governments, and on the cover of fashion magazines.MARK SMITHDONALD TRUMP, BORIS JOHNSON, NIGEL FARAGE AND VLADIMIR PUTIN, POPULIST POLITICIANSVladimir Putin is about to mark  years in power ndash he first became Russian president on December ,  ndash and for much of that time the West has looked at his style ndash authoritarian, bombastic and a little bit silly ndash and thought: thank God were not like that.But that was then. First, a man with a fag in his mouth ndash call me Nigel ndash became leader of Ukip and the Brexit Party. Then a man with a phone in his hand ndash call me Donald ndash became president of the United States. And then a man with an inappropriate phrase on the tip of his tongue ndash call me Boris ndash became Prime Minister of the UK.Its not a coincidence they are known by their Christian names. Nigel, Donald and Boris represent a new, first-names-only style of politics that has dominated America and the UK in the last  years: populist, chummy, big on rhetoric, light on detail, and ndash much to the frustration of liberals ndash effective at attracting votes. Those three men have attracted support from working class voters who have traditionally looked to the left for answers. In the last  years, though, theyve looked right, and the result is Nigel, Donald and Boris.The next decade will decide their fate. Arguably, Farage has already been neutered after the Brexit Partys dismal election campaign. But the fates of Trump and Johnson are less certain. Trump has been impeached and will face a trial in the Senate, but its controlled by the Republicans, who arent going to vote their man out. As for Johnson, hes just won a big, blue majority and, failing a cock-uphes going to be here for the next five years.Beware:  years of populism may become .MARK SMITHPROFESSOR PETER HIGGS, SCIENTISTScience always plays the long game. It took almost a century for scientists in  to prove Einsteins  predictions of gravitational waves in space, which formed part of his theory of general relativity. Professor Peter Higgs didnt have to wait quite that long.Back in , while teaching at Edinburgh University, Higgs published papers predicting the existence of a particle that gave mass to the most basic building blocks of matter. It soon became known as the Higgs Boson. Much to his dismay, it was also called the God particle.No-one could find it, however. Or not until , when the large hadron collider near Geneva finally proved its existence.A year later Higgs, then , won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the prize with fellow scientist Francois Englert.Higgs decided to go on holiday when the prize was announced, neglecting to take his mobile phone with him in a bid to avoid being pestered by journalists. They could wait. He had, after all.TEDDY JAMIESONEL JAMES, AUTHORThere was a moment, in the summer of , where everywhere you looked someone had their nose in a copy Fty Shades of Grey.

These two melting pots, rather unedyingly, have had global issues added to them .What is missing here  Labour. Who would have thought, even five years ago, that the Labour Party would be neither the irresistible force nor the immovable object of Scottish politics  Yet here we are, and it is no small irony that the man who Torrance credited with first coining the \"Ulsterisation of Scottish politics\" phrase was Aiden Kerr, a then-broadcaster who went on to join Labours communications effort.The Labour Party, north and south of the border, is lying face-down in the dirt. It is faced with the stark choice of closing its eyes and dying, or opening them and understanding how to rehabilitate itself.The party is in this position primarily for two reasons a lack of leadership and a lack of relevance. The first of those is both the most obvious and instinctively should be the easiest to solve. Jeremy Corbyn has been calamitous for party and country the toxic mix of suspicion about his loyalty to Britain, his indecisiveness on big issues like Brexit, his unconvincing reaction to the anti-Semitism crisis and his Marxism made him a figure of suspicion and despair amongst the mainstream, with his popularity limited to a cultist echo-chamber on Twitter.Like most cults, it thinks the problem is the opposite of what it actually is, and so it appears almost inevitable that Labour is ready to repeat its mistake ndash to meet Einsteins definition of insanity by doing the same thing over and over again and expecting dferent results ndash by elevating Corbyns chosen successor to the role. Rebecca Long-Bailey is a gt for Boris Johnson, wrapped in sparkly blue paper and tied in a bow.If she does win, Labours moderate MPs have one decision to make, but for the purposes of this article I shall place that to one side. For the more urgent decision must be made by the partys MSPs who,  months from the Scottish election which is likely to result in a final decision on the second independence referendum, have no role and no relevance.In order to get some, first Scottish Labour must accept its position and start to exploit it. In many ways, it still thinks and behaves like a large party, unable to understand the reality that it is no longer in either government or opposition. But it could exploit its position, particularly the position of not being one of the \"Ulsterised\" political poles.For Labours lack of relevance to the Scottish constitutional debate actually allows them to be far more nimble than either the SNP or the Tories it allows them to change, radically and quickly. The centrepiece of that change must be to sever all ties with the UK Labour Party.This is a change which is coming to all the pro-UK parties it is a matter of time. The truth is that we collectively bungled the set-up of the Scottish Parliament, andHolyrood had been populated by political parties of and for it, rather than limbs of their UK brethren, it is entirely possible that we would not be in the position in which we are. The Tories and Labour, in particular, recoil against accusations of being \"branch offices\", but having worked in that environment I know that the cold reality is that they are, re veranot de facto.Labour can gain a first mover advantage by shting towards a Canadian model, whereby it creates a separate identity for itself , unique, Scottish, with none of Londons baggage, and its own positions.With it, the party has a signicantly greater chance of creating a viable narrative on the key issue of the day in Scotland ndash independence. We should, by now, be past the point of seeing this as a short-term issue. It has been simmering for a  years, bubbling for  and boiling for , and whatever the result of the now-likely second independence referendum, its effects will remain with us for the rest of our lives. Scottish Labour cant sit this one out.By creating its own, fully autonomous party and brand, Labours MSPs can do what the SNP doesnt need to do, and what the Tories appear to be unable to do, which is to create the one solution to this conundrum that the Scottish people have consistently said they want but which has never been offered to them ndash the \"something in the middle\" option.Thus far, the debate within Labour has been how to again be one of the poles. Instead, Labour must accept that this is a game it cannot win, and instead it should invent a new game. Instead of attempting to replace a pole, it should create a new one of its own.Labour could be the antidote to the \"Ulsterisation\" of our politics which, as sure as night follows day, will in time repel and disgust a large swathe of the centre ground of Scotlands electorate. That is the future for Scottish Labours MSPs. A party with unique and bespoke positions on the constitution, on the balance between fair taxation and enterprise, between environmental care and economic growth, between public service investment and public service reform.In short, they could be a European-style social democratic party. And, in a post-indyref  environment, they could win again.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"new-year-honours-list-stars-screen-sport-charity-recognised","story":"British-born Australian songstress Olivia Newton-John is made a dame for services to charity, cancer research and entertainment, while critically acclaimed director Sam Mendes gets a knighthood for his contribution to drama.From politics, Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of the controversial Universal Credit system, is knighted alongside colleague Bob Neill.Elsewhere, Englands cricketing heroes, including Joe Root and Ben Stokes, are also recognised.Mendes, who has directed two Bond films as well as multiple international theatre productions, said he was \"amazed, delighted and extremely proud\".He told the PA news agency: \"I have stood on the shoulders of so many collaborators and colleagues over the last  years - actors, writers, designers, producers, technicians - to whom I owe a huge debt of gratitude.

This week, we had the Boxing Day hunts, or faux hunts at least, where severe-looking people and their torn-faced hounds are pictured bouncing or scurrying along lanes, bringing entirely justiable terror to the countryside.Many sensitive people find such pictures disturbing. They think the horse-riders look insufferably pompous, which is undoubtedly unfair,entirely understandable. Itrsquos a good rule to guide you through le: never trust anyone on a horse. Far-right activist Hermann Goering believed it taught the rider mastery over another human being, which was a bit odd as most people looked down on him as a fat turd.All the same, to be up there, master of all you survey, might be accounted marvellous by anyone who doesnrsquot think he looks a perfect fright in a prissy wee protective hat and a tweed jacket that fails to cover the lower buttocks. Sadly, having failed to evolve, the onward march of civilisation has left the fox-manglers on the brink of extinction, with almost all decent ratepayers in opinion polls welcoming their demise. Such a shame. Human beings can be so cruel sometimes.Speaking of ratepayers, decent or otherwise, and foxes , a clash between these took place in rural London this week. In a case that the RSPCA is investigating, an alleged human, Jolyon Maugham, battered an alleged fox to death with a baseball bat while wearing a kimono .To be clear, the kimono belonged to the manrsquos we. It was made of silk. The man is himself a silk or QC, a Remain-obsessed barrister opposed to beastly migrants entering his garden illegally. To be fair, he thought the fox was after his chickens ndash you townies just donrsquot understand the reality of country le in London. And anyway, most of you will have done something similar over the festive season, though few would be so imprudent as to publicise the achievement on social media.I think itrsquos fair to say that many Earthlings get a bit soppy when it comes to animals. Irsquove seen YouTube videos where people recount terrible things that have happened to them and, in the comments below, people say: ldquoBut was the cat all right These beasties are often referred to as ldquofur babies and videos of them when young get hundreds of thousands of views, even though, while other animals do genuinely seem to be playing, the average kittenrsquos every move mimics pouncing, slashing, eviscerating and killing. All together now: aaaww!But I must admit Irsquom as soft and goo-goo-ga-ga as the next grown man when it comes to baby animals. And my attitude to cats is the same as it is to humans: I deplore them as a species but count many as inidual friends.A major story in the papers this week involved a cat that had been missing for six or seven yearsand came home on Christmas Eve. The amazing thing was how unfazed it looked, just carrying on as normal, licking its posterior and so forth.Asthat werenrsquot enough, many papers filled their festive pages with the most spectacular pictures of wildle taken over the year, usually featuring flying, leaping, faffing aboot in the sea or having a square go with other beasties. Le of Reilly by the looks of it.Itrsquos amazing to think how our attitude to animals has changed in the last  years. We used to want to blooter them all with extreme prejudice. Now we try to protect them. There are mutts and moggies everywhere you look. A horror of both commitment and poop means I can never have a pet, and I sometimes envy those who do, even where they have clearly taken leave off their senses and mollycoddle the beasts to within an inch of their lives.But better mollycoddled than mangled in my view.+++IF I might paraphrase John Lennon: imagine there were no bagpipes. The nation was shocked to learn this week that bagpipe tuition is on the wane despite a healthy interest in the instrument from young persons with bags of puff to spare.According to the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust, while between , and , pupils want to blow into the bag, only , in state schools get the opportunity to do so. The trust hopes to change that, partly through community initiatives and the revival of bands.Well, there are worse things to shout. And worse instruments to play . Yonder Hittites may have provided the first archaeological evidence for bagpipes but, lo, the instrument is Scotiarsquos noo ndash and ever will be so.++++MORE and more people are starting to live in vans. This is nothing to do with the great British tradition of homelessness. Itrsquos a lestyle choice. Theyrsquore norsquo mad. Theyrsquore nomads.Itrsquos the old story: the mortgage, suburbia, the job getting them down. They want to do something with their lives, which is never a good idea in my view, and, worse still, they want to travel, which can only ever lead to trouble.Itrsquos the Good Le without having to grow veg, and it popped up this week in the popular prints, with more experiences recounted on YouTube and pictures posted on yon Instagram. This appears to be an ulterior motivation for many: becoming a star on social media.This is, Irsquom sure, a noble aim, particularly among those who make the more educational films that deal with the vexed subjects of how to keep yourself clean and where to have a wizz or worse.The more irresponsible take their bairns with them, rearing them as rootless was, who look oot the windae and never see the same thing twice. Doubtless, theyrsquoll grow up to be criminals or estate agents, as they learn the lesson of le: all is vanity.++++LIFE in the ghetto is hard, as many Edinburgh residents can tell you. Irsquom thinking in particular of those living around the central areas of Rose Street, Hanover Street and Frederick Street. Quite posh, and not your normal idea of a ghetto, but thus itrsquos been dubbed after residents were gubbed by the controversial capitalrsquos Hogmanay party.Theyrsquoll need to wear special wristbandsthey want access to their own homes during the disgraceful Bacchanalia. The development has led to further accusations that the city is becoming a ldquotheme park for touroids.Residents are also having to ldquoregister guests attending their own parties. Why anyone would want tolive in the centre of Edinburgh, orattend the cityrsquos Hogmanay revels, orattend any sort of party, is beyond me.I didnrsquot know that many people lived on those streets ndash itrsquos all shops and pubs. All the same, what kind of liberty is it, readers  Correct: diabolical.One resident said they were being treated ldquolike criminals, with their details passed to the police for checks. Of course,people were sensible and just stayed in their own homes and went to bed early on Hogmanay, the problem wouldnrsquot arise.Read more: Rampant narcissism, gruesome deaths and pachyderm posteriors ... but thats enough about me"},{"url":null,"title":"comedian-susan-calman-says-incredible-honour-host-bbc-scotlands-hogmanay-show","story":"Calman, , will take over the role played by Hogmanay icon Jackie Bird for the past  years, when she fronts the channels iconic New Year celebrations.The stand up comic and former Strictly star will look back over  in Susan Calmanrsquos Not Quite End Of Year show at pm, thenat .pm to see the nation through the bells with fellow comedian Des Clarke and presenter Amy Irons as well as a host of guests.She said: \"Itrsquos an institution Irsquove grown up with and to be part of that is the most incredible honour.\"Watching Hogmanay on BBC Scotland brings back so many lovely family memories and I think itrsquos the same for most people in Scotland.

Ms Bird announced in September that she would not host the coverage this year, saying she is would be \"up for a party\" on her night off instead of counting down to midnight with the nation for the first time in  years.Calman added: \"Irsquom , and Irsquove spent half my le watching Jackie Bird on BBC Scotland at New Year and I just feel thatI can carry on the legacy that shersquos put in place, then Irsquoll be doing a good job.\"If I can be half as recognisable as the face of Hogmanay as Jackie has been, then Irsquod be delighted, because shersquos amazing.\"I think whatrsquos really important about the show is that itrsquos for people who are sitting among  family and friends at home or people who are watching alone.

Richer and stronger than any European power, at its height the Mughal Empire ruled over more than  million subjects and extended across most of the Indian subcontinent.The extraordinary splendour of the Mughal court was captured by artists in intricate paintings and manuscripts. George III was given a number of these magnicent works, forming one of the greatest collections of South Asian works on paper outside the subcontinent.In , Lord Teignmouth, Governor-General of India, presented the King with six volumes as gts from the Nawab of Awadh. Among these was the mid-th-century Padshahnama , an illustrated chronicle commissioned by the fth Mughal Emperor Shah-Jahan as a celebration of his reign and dynasty, described by Teignmouth as lsquothe most splendidrsquo Mughal manuscript he ever saw.The rise of the East India Company was also reflected in the gts of manuscripts presented to successive British monarchs on behalf of the Company and by Company officers.Such works included a Quran owned by Tipu Sultan of Mysore with an illuminated frontispiece and gilt-stamped and painted bindings, presented to George III. Detailed architectural drawings were commissioned from local draughtsmen by Colin MacKenzie, the Scottish Surveyor-General of the Company. A pen and ink drawing, c., shows a plan of the temple at Srirangam, one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage sites in India.Following her accession in , Queen Victoria received many illuminated royal letters and gts of paintings and manuscripts from South Asia. A posthumous portrait of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of the Punjab, c., was sent to the Queen by his successor, Sher Singh, in an unusual jewel-encrusted gold frame with a letter of belated congratulations on her marriage and the birth of her first son.It will be displayed alongside a sketch of his son, Maharaja Duleep Singh, by Queen Victoria. Following the East India Companyrsquos annexation of the Punjab in , Duleep Singh moved to England where he became a favourite of the Queen, regularly visiting Osborne House and Windsor Castle.Queen Victoria received many books written about or dedicated to her from India, including a volume of her own published journals, The Queenrsquos Travels in Scotland and Ireland, translated into Hindi by the Maharajah of Benares.The Queen recorded the bookrsquos arrival in England: lsquoMy book, translated into Hindustani, beautully illuminated, containing a painting of me, by a native artist, receiving the present from the Maharajah of Benares, bound in inlaid marble, is very curious  really beautul.rsquoVictoriarsquos interest in South Asian culture continued throughout her le. Her studies of the Hindustani language, undertaken in her seventies with her Indian secretary Abdul Karim, are recorded in her Hindustani diaries, which will be displayed in the exhibition with her Hindustani phrasebook.Queen Victoriarsquos second son Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh was the first member of the royal family to visit India in , followed six years later by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales , who toured India for four months in -.This second trip acted as a precursor to the formal declaration of Queen Victoria as Empress of India in . During his tour the Prince was presented with several works of art from the Hindu courts of northern India including a series of vibrant paintings from Jaipur that reproduced verses from the Sanskrit devotional poem Gita Govinda .Although King Edward VII never ed to India, he sent his brother and later his son, the future King George V, on royal tours of South Asia.

When people hear yoursquove got a sailing boat, all these assumptions come flooding in ndash so I actually donrsquot tell people often. I find the right moment to mention it, and then I quickly say, lsquoItrsquos my dadrsquos boat and he built it.rsquoYou can ide boaters into two groups: one is yachties and the other is sailors, of which Im one. Sailors sail and yachties own yachts ndash they are like floating rugby clubs. They go into marinas. I always anchor in remote places. Because for me thatrsquos the whole point ndash the escapism.Irsquove always kept the boat where my dad left it near Oban, because itrsquos about a frac-hour drive from where I live in Edinburgh. It has access to so many amazing places. Irsquove sailed to Ireland. I can sail out to the Outer Hebrides, up to Skye or the Summer Isles. Irsquove got a handful of little anchorages that I know I can get to in just a day. I can find a spot that suits the weather. There is an anchorage for every weather condition.There are places you canrsquot get to very often, like Kiloran beach on Colonsay, which is supposedly the Queenrsquos favourite beach. Itrsquos west-facing and exposed to prevailing weather. But I managed to anchor there one beautul still warm night. There was no one on the beach, just me and my mate and a bottle of whisky, watching the sun go down.There are things that worry me though. Irsquom very aware of the plastic issue because I go into lots of remote little anchorages and there are thousands of small coves and bays on the west coast of Scotland that are full of plastic. Thatrsquos never going to get removed. Thatrsquos there forever. People tidy up their lovely dog-walking beach near where they live, but thatrsquos only a tiny percentage of the problem.Irsquove been sad to see this, and also the massive increase in industrial aqua-farming. For example, there is an island that I used to anchor at, and I dont any more because you canrsquot look at the island any more without seeing salmon nets. The salmon industry often talks about the fact that theyrsquore raising these salmon in pristine Scottish waters. Scottish waters are pristine, but theyrsquore not pristine where salmon farms are, because itrsquos industrial and itrsquos polluting.When my dad died, it was like, lsquoOh my God, what are we going to do with the boat rsquo I just decided to take it on. But itrsquos been tough to keep it going. Therersquos a constant conveyor belt of jobs to be done. But I do it because itrsquos such a privilege.\"Fenella RenwickSeafood chef\"Myself and Kirsty Scobie run the Ullapool Seafood Shack. Shersquos local to here and I moved up about  years ago. Ullapool is such an amazing place, with all the fishing boats and everything coming in and out, and we just felt there was a gap in the market for a place to sell some cooked shellfish. For us its all about the streetfood thing and making the most of the produce we can get.Wersquore lucky enough to be on the coast and have everything at our hands. The guy who does the oyster farm is only a few miles away. We get most of our produce from Kirstyrsquos partner, Josh, who is a fisherman and gets langoustines and lobsters. Our fishmonger is local to Ullapool and we get our haddock from him. By far our most popular dish is our haddock wrap.People want to know where the food has come from these days. We can literally point and say itrsquos come out from there this morning and itrsquos freshly cooked for you today. I would say, since we started running the shack, I have a lot more respect and awareness of what the fishermen actually do. My husband is a scallop er and works offshore. When you see the days they go out in ... With the weather because living up here is beautul but at the same time we can have some wild days ndash and the fishermen still go out. Itrsquos their livelihoods.\"Matt RhodesWild swimming tour guide\"I am always finding new spots to swim on Skye. In season, I take people for swimming tours about five times a week, and on those I swim at least three times, and at most six. My tag line is that there are far better places to swim on Skye than the Fairy Pools. Theyre a special place, but itrsquos a lot of hype. So many people there and so many footprints now, that itrsquos taken away from it.Just the other day, we went up to a broch near Dunvegan. Therersquos little jut of land that comes off from the mainland, and, on it, this broch. Just underneath it therersquos an inland sea lagoon that gets cut off at the tide, just perfect for keeping a boat in. This lagoon is like a swimming pool.Everywhere I go, Irsquoll take ownership of it by swimming there as much as I can. Irsquove got this thing where I feel almost thatrsquos mine now. I feel like Irsquove not fully explored that place until Irsquove swum in the loch thatrsquos there or the pools.\"Tommy ThomsonCanal manager\"Irsquove been working on the canals since , when I got a job working at Broxburn. Back then, the Union Canal was a remainder canal, with very few boats going through it, and it was on a reduced budget from Westminster, just to keep it safe. When I got the job, though I stayed nearby, I had never heard of the canals.My job was to carry out maintenance on the canal. Then we worked together to get local funding and went to local government and tried to open up sections of the canal along the way. In  we were given money to reopen the canal. It was very rewarding and challenging times. We were opening up a canal that had been closed since the Beeching days and getting it back to le again. We were working on all aspects of dredging and civil engineering works and new lock gates, and then also bringing the facilities for the customers.Back in  I worked for a few years at the office for the Falkirk Wheel. Itrsquos an important link between the two canals ndash Forth  Clyde and the Union. When you think of the  locks that you used to have to take from the Union canal down to lock sixteen where Auntie Katiersquos pub is, and compare with what wersquove got now. Yoursquove got a couple of locks on the top, down on to an aqueduct, breathtaking scenery, and then the experience of coming down with two caissons. And, energy-wise, for the beast to rotate round, itrsquos only the equivalent of flicking a switch on a kettle.When I first started working on the Union canal, when you walked along the towpath, it was virtually closed up. The only people who would walk along there were what we thought of as the Last of the Summer Wine groups. There were not many boats. But once we opened it all up, it transformed it into a beautul leisure pathway for people to enjoy. We gave it a new le, and also the communities around about were given a new le, because they were getting involved and seeing this transformed canal that had been stinky, muddy and neglected looking, coming to le.\"Joanna MacfarlaneBeach cleaner\"Beach cleaning is really important. I think when the sea dumps it on the beach, you get a chance to get it out of the sea, andyou donrsquot collect it, then it will go back out with the next high tide and may never then .I live in the village of Charlestown in Fe, next to Limekilns, right on the coast. I come originally from Cornwall and Irsquove lived my whole le by the sea, which has always been a passion and a love of mine. Irsquove seen marine litter on the beach and issues of plastic pollution, but when I came here, five years ago, on to the Firth of Forth, I was pretty shocked by the amount of sewage related debris, microplastics, and larger plastics on the beach. When I was growing up in Cornwall, sewage was an issue. I remember stuff in the sea, but it was more natural sewage as opposed to wipes and sanitary items and cotton buds and all this stuff we are seeing now.We found that we had river coming through the village that comes from Dunfermline, called the Linn Burn and we discovered that when storm tanks overflow, they go into that river. Thatrsquos also happening along the Firth of Forth that some overflow pipes are going straight out into the sea when therersquos too much rain.Thatrsquos a major issue because Scottish Water, bless them, have got an old infrastructure and increasing demand with new property development. However, evenit does overflow what you would expect is poo and wee and toilet paper. But what wersquore getting is wipes and sanitary items and cotton buds, all made of plastic that will be forever in the sea.Irsquom an environmental educator with a business called Wild Planet Explorers. I designed a P pledge, made a logo, and then at ious events I got people in the households around here to pledge to never throw anything down the toilet except the Ps . In Fe thousands of children are doing it, and Scottish Water partnered with me this year and funded me to go into five schools.\"Bob whiteSalmon ghillie, River Tay\"The biggest salmon I ever caught was lb back in . Irsquove been a keen salmon fisher since I was about  and I spent all my spare time going fishing.When you get into salmon fishing it really takes a hold of you. Then I decided I wanted to be a ghillie and try and give something back ndash because Irsquove caught an awful lot of salmon and I just felt I could impart some of what Irsquove learned to other people. Thatrsquos what I do now ndash take people out on to the river and try to deliver an experience.But the last five years the catches have collapsed. I launched a petition to the Scottish parliament a couple of weeks ago demanding a full stakeholder consultation on the future of stocking salmon in our rivers. Last year was a record low for stocks, and this yearrsquos catch, certainly on the Tay, is going to look similar,not less. The Spey, the Dee, the Tweed, the Tay, the big rivers are struggling. Wersquore losing clients hand over fist, who are not coming back because of the lack of opportunity of catching.The petition was in response to Marine Scotland, who last year published a stocking policy without consulting the stakeholders, people like us, who are at the coal face. Last year, for all the beats that I run, we caught  salmon, and we used to get on a good year something like .  is a pathetic catch for the beats that Irsquove got.The high and mighty say that the salmon stock is all going tonaturally without stocking the rivers. Scientists keep telling us that stocking doesnrsquot work. But it has worked all over the world. Rivers in Norway that were completely wiped out with disease have been restocked by stocked fish and theyrsquove come back again. What Irsquom saying is that it must be a tool for rivers.The main reason for the decline is that therersquos something going wrong in the sea. Going back thirty years ago, therate from the sea would be something like - percent. Wersquore now down to three percent, and I think thatrsquos possibly due to global warming, the sea temperature rising, the food source moving away.One of the pleasures of fishing is being at the riverside, the scenery, the running water. Thatrsquos part of the experience we deliver to clients. You can point out ospreys and otters. A lot of the people that came last year, from America and all over the world, had never fished for salmon before. And theyrsquore absolutely blown away by the scenery. The salmon is the icing on the cake,they catch one, but rarely do they catch. But they go away, in any case, just in awe of the place.\""},{"url":null,"title":"water-babies-cant-wait-dive-year-coast-waters","story":"In Leith, where I live, a sprawl of docks sits between town and the Firth of Forth, and the riverrsquos edge bears the indents of former dry docks. A stonersquos throw away is Newhaven, where fishwives gutted and packed the silver darlings that were once part of a long-gone Scottish boom ndash just as they did in Shetland, Eyemouth, Fe, Aberdeen, Stornoway, Peterhead.Wherever you are, be it on the Clyde, the Tay, the Don, the seashore, or the loch-country of the Highlands, itrsquos unlikely you are far from a reminder of our dependence on our waters ndash or far from a glimpse of their magic.Scots have long been people of the water ndash fishermen, herring lasses, anglers, river ghillies, shipyard workers, canal men, traders, whalers, smugglers. We have travelled on the sea, and fed ourselves from it, in a relationship stretching way back to the shellfish remains found at archaeological sites such as Orkneyrsquos Skara Brae.But itrsquos not only our seas that we have this connection to. The fresh waters that run from our mountains to the ocean have helped form us almost as much as our salty seas. They are the home of that iconic king of fish, the wild salmon, whose stocks are now so low that its survival is considered a conservation issue. They are the rushing waters which people canyon and kayak down, the wide rivers in which they fish.Throughout  Visit Scotland is celebrating all things wet and wild in its Year Of Coasts And Waters, and bringing attention to some of our greatest natural treasures. As with all these years, this is about sending out a call to the rest of the world. As Marie Christie, Head of Development at VisitScotland puts it, this is about inviting them ldquoto e into the amazing experiences our coasts and waters provide. From water inspired myths and legends, historic harbours, roaring rivers, captivating canals and sweeping coastlines to the very best in seafood, whisky, wildle and wellness\".But itrsquos also a celebration for those of us who live here, an excuse to do what many of us love, and mess about on the water. It says a great deal about us that in , between January and August, there were two million overnight visits to coastal resorts and towns by Scots on ldquostaycations. We are drawn to the shores. We have, as the author Wallace J Nichols puts it, a \"blue mind\". We feel good next to water. Project Soothe, a study at Edinburgh University, has been finding that many of the images we find most relaxing and soothing are those involving water.That being in or near water gives us this sense of wellbeing is at the heart of a book I have just published with photographer Anna Deacon, titled Taking The Plunge: The Healing Power Of Wild Swimming For Mind, Body And Soul. I have spent the last year getting to know Scotlandrsquos waters better ndash by literally getting right in them and swimming in reservoirs, rivers, lochs, and bays all round the country, from breaking the ice at Loch Morlich to ing into Skyersquos Lealt Falls, with the wild swimming communities that love them. Whatrsquos clear to me, is that water is one of the places where we play best.How we enjoy our waters is changing. More and more of us are getting involved in watersports. Research published this year showed an ongoing rise. The annual Watersports Participation Survey showed that approximately . million UK adults took part in one or more boating activities in . Of the boating activities, canoeing was the most popular, with . million people going paddling at least once a year, in canoes, kayaks or stand up paddleboards.This year VisitScotland hopes to encourage that still further. Its Growth Fund has awarded funding to West Coast Waters and Sail Scotland to deliver marketing campaigns recognising the importance of sailing and watersports activities as a key reason to visit Scotland. In October Kip Marina on the Clyde will be host to River Of Light, in which Scotlands Boat Show is transformed into a glittering nighttime display as boats are festooned with lights, and non-yachties are invited down to enjoy the display. But you donrsquot have own an expensive yacht to get out on the water. There are more accessible ways to float. You can be part of a community that builds a skf and rows it out on the water, or hire a kayak or canoe.Time spent in our seas and lochs provides an often-valued connection with nature. Indeed, thatrsquos what many of us are there for. Wildle tourism, it has been calculated, nets more than pound million for the Scottish economy each year. One of the best ways to see many of our astounding native species ndash whether puffins, seals, kittiwakes, sea eagles or porpoises ndash is by boat.James McGurk, a wildle guide for Seafari Adventures, has described to me some of the sights he has seen, including a boat-trip to the famous Corryvreckan, in which fins suddenly appeared around the boat. ldquoBottlenose dolphins around here are the largest in the world, over four metres long, enormous creatures. When they see a boat, particularly in this area, all they want to do is play, so theyrsquoll just head straight for you. They try to ride in the bow wave. These dolphins had young ones with them ndash probably a few weeks old, and you could see them moving underneath the water. Then the parents started almost nudging them into the bow wave of the boat asthey were trying to say this is how we play with a boat. It was really magical.The more we connect with nature, and what is going on in our waters, however, the more we witness our own impact. We see, for instance, as we swim, sail, canoe or beachcomb, just how much plastic pollution is on our own shores. The global problem that documentaries like Plastic Ocean and Blue Planet have made us aware of is right on our doorstep. The fightback against such plastic pollution has already begun, and not just on the beaches, where communities are organising clean-ups. Itrsquos also happening in the rivers, where Joy Godfrey and Stuart Forbes were behind a clean-up campaign of the River Esk, titled Irsquom Back Caring.Godfrey recalls that she began to notice the rubbish in the river she had played in as a child. ldquoIt is devastating to see the wet wipes and sanitary towels and smell the sewage in the River South Esk. Powerless as I felt to change this, the Dipper standing on a sewer wet wipe draped over its fishing perch is even more powerless ... and I knew that whatever my limitations, I had to be a voice for their habitat.Among those making inroads in battling such pollution is Dr Madeleine Berg, from Fidra, the organisation behind the The Great Nurdle Hunt, which helps document and clear our coastlines of the tiny plastic pellets, and other awareness-raising projects. Whatrsquos remarkable about Fidra is what theyrsquore doing to help change things. Not only did they develop a citizenrsquos science project which removed millions of nurdles from our beaches, but they are working to fight them ending up there in the first place.ldquoItrsquos accidental spills that arenrsquot cleared up properly that lead to this problem. There are lots of ways that companies can work better to ensure thatrsquos not happening. At the moment industry has put forward a voluntary toolkit. Wersquove been pushing to make that scheme certied and externally audited, and to cover the complete supply chain, so that the people who are putting plastic on the market, retailers, can check back down the supply chain and find out whether pellets are being used responsibly all the way along.One of our deepest and most long-running connections to the sea is as a source of food. Itrsquos one of the cupboards in our national larder. Last year, in , Scottish-registered fishing vessels landed  tonnes of sea fish and shellfish with a value of pound million. Meanwhile, a report by the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation shows that their industry had a turnover of just over a billion pounds in the same year.Food is also one of things people go to the waterrsquos edge for ndash fish and chips on a windy beach while being ed at by seagulls, a crab sandwich at the harbour in Oban, oysters at Loch Fyne. Food tourism, where people travel for memorable food and drink experiences, is now a growing trend.A VisitScotland spokesperson notes: ldquoItrsquos been really interesting to see the fishing industry ersy over the years to bring traditional activities to the forefront and help attract visitors looking for authentic and enriching experiences, all spotlighting the provenance of our natural ocean larder. From seafood safaris where you can sample delicious shellfish to immersing yourself in a taste of a fishermans le on a boat ride.Stranraer Oyster Festival, they point out, is just one example of the events showcasing Scotlandrsquos natural larder. More than , visitors enjoyed the packed programme in , and in , they expanded and delivered a programme enjoyed by , visitors. It is hoped that, once the final numbers are in, this years event, held over three days in September, will be even bigger again.There are also food producers around the country, finding new ways of producing a sustainable, renewable harvest from its waters. Among them is Fiona Houston, of Mara Seaweed, whose company is taking the joys of eating Scottish seaweed as a seasoning and alternative-to-salt into the mainstream, with support from Tescos business incubator scheme.Houston says: ldquoItrsquos really the health benefits that people are waking up to ndash so Tesco are putting it on the shelf as healthy salt.Houston believes Scotland needs to take this further and has the opportunity to be ldquoat the forefront of a whole new blue economy.ldquoItrsquos not only about human health,\" she says, \"itrsquos also about planet health, because seaweed has such an incredible role to play in reducing global warming. Itrsquos a carbon sink.\"What is amazing about seaweed is that it requires no soil and no fertiliser and evenyoursquore farming it, itrsquos not being farmed in the intensive way you are on land. All yoursquore doing is putting ropes out into the sea and the seaweed grows with the nutrients in the water and the sunlight. Itrsquos more like ranching than intensive farming.But the story of our relationship to our marine larder is not a straightforward one. The herring population, which was a source of such a boom a century ago, collapsed, overfished, in the s, and there is only tentative talk of it now possibly ing. North Sea cod, which had only just in  been put back on the menu as a sustainable fish, lost its blue tick certication this year. Wild salmon stocks have dropped so much that they are being seen as a conservation issue. Last year, for instance, saw the lowest catch levels, ever reported in Scotland.If you have been eating Scottish salmon this Christmas then, unless you hooked it out of the water yourself, you were consuming a farmed product. Since the closure of the last wild salmon facility in late , all of Scottish salmon production has been farmed, and the industry is not without its own criticism for its fish welfare and environmental impact.One of the things that has been clear to me is that the people who know our waters best are those who spend time in or on them. Those who fish them, or e in them, those who research them, or have dedicated their leisure time to pottering about on the water, whether on skfs, yachts, kayaks or paddleboards. And yes, those who swim in them. People, like, for instance, Richard Cox, who completes, this week, a year of swimming in the sea and other wild spots, every day.A scallop er, like Alasdair Hughson who runs Keltic Seafare, for instance, bears witness to what is going on under the surface of the water. Hughson has been ing since he was  years old, and grew up watching his father scallop-ing, and speaks of his concern that decades of scallop dredging have damaged areas of the seabed.The Year of Coast And Waters allows us to look into our seafaring past, to examine how wersquove become the nation we are, shaped by ship-building, trading and fishing. But itrsquos also an opportunity to look forward.Our relationship with the sea is ever evolving. As much as it is our history, it is also our future. Getting our relationship with the marine environment right is key. The sea still has much to offer us. Its powerful tides are a source of renewable energy. The kelp forest that grows in some parts can act as a carbon sink.Above all the Year Of Coast And Waters should be a reminder thatwe want to forge a future for all le in this country and on this planet, we must go to the waterrsquos edge and look at what lies beneath, and look after it."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-honoring-scots-aid-worker-now-working-taliban-held-areas","story":"THE PARENTS of a Scottish aid worker killed after being kidnapped by Afghan rebels have revealed the foundation launched in her memory is now operating in Taliban-controlled areas.Linda Norgrove was working on humanitarian projects for an international development company when she was kidnapped by Taliban rebels in .The -year-old died during a disastrous attempt by US Navy SEALS to rescue her.Her parents, John and Lorna, later established the Linda Norgrove Foundation which has gone on to distribute more than pound million in support for women and children affected by the war in Afghanistan.In a new message to the Foundationrsquos supporters, the Norgroves have confirmed that the organisation has now taken the decision to deliver support projects in some of the countryrsquos Taliban-controlled areas.Writing in the foundationrsquos December newsletter, the couple conceded that ldquoinevitably, these changes wonrsquot suit everyone, and offered to remove people unhappy at the sht in focus from their mailing list.However, the couple said the move was made in order to ensure support reaches women and children outside Kabul, where much of the foundationrsquos work has been centred.Their message adds: ldquoMost poor Afghans donrsquot live in cities but, as the government has lost control of many rural areas, it has become increasingly dficult to access those in need of our help.ldquoRegrettably, an increasing number of our projects have been delivered in the capital, Kabul.ldquoTo address this, we have made a conscious decision to start working in places where the Taliban are the lsquode factorsquo government.ldquoWe are not a government or a political organisation ndash we will help women and children irrespective of their government.They add: ldquoThis doesnrsquot mean we will not resist the attitudes to women the Taliban hold, but we will continue to help women from poor rural backgrounds however the situation develops.ldquoAdapt we must.The sht comes after it emerged that the militant commander said to be behind their daughterrsquos kidnap had surrendered and been pardoned after agreeing to give up his fight against the Afghan government.Mullah Abdul Basir is reported to have been freed after being told he would not face kidnap charges.Linda, who grew up on a croft in Lewis, was working for American aid contractor DAI when she and three Afghan locals were seized in the volatile Kunar province in September .Her Taliban kidnappers offered to release her in exchange for a series of demands, including the withdrawal of British troops from Afghanistan, the release of insurgent prisoners from Kunar and the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a -year-old neuroscientist dubbed ldquoLady al-Qaeda by US newspapers.Siddiqui had been jailed for  years by a New York court for the attempted murder of US agents and soldiers who were trying to interrogate her in Afghanistan.Lindarsquos three Afghan colleagues were released after a week of negotiations.However,  days after her capture, news reports backed by then foreign secretary William Hague suggested she had been killed by an explosion set off by one of her captors during a rescue attempt by special services.It later emerged she had been accidentally killed by a grenade thrown by one of her would-be rescuers while her captors lay either dead or dying.Lindarsquos grieving parents established The Linda Norgrove Foundation which has gone on to support a number of projects, including a home in Kabul for children with disabilities, a school for poor children and widows, and university scholarships.It has also supported smaller projects which have included equipping  women with the means to generate income through silkworm rearing, spinning and weaving, the Ascend programme which inspires young women to climb mountains, and two projects in the remote Wakhan valley, one for the planting of trees, small orchards and kitchen gardens, another teaching basic hygiene to remote pastoralists and nomads.However, writing in the latest newsletter, Mr and Mrs Norgrove, who are both now in their seventies, highlight the changing face of Afghanistan and the dficulties of finding appropriate projects to support.They write: ldquoNine years ago, Afghanistanrsquos lsquoreconstructionrsquo was progressing fast, probably too fast, but things appeared to be improving.ldquoNow, even though need has increased, we find it more dficult to find good new projects.ldquoMany NGOs have pulled out because of deteriorating security, and itrsquos become more dficult

The. Bee. Bee. Cee. Gee surely losing it would be unthinkable Imagine that, without the BBC, all broadcasting was run by the free market, the stable and entirely sane system that brings us footballersrsquo wages and property prices. Without the state to save us, wersquod be in a dog-eat-dog free-for-all, ken  So how would we manage without a state broadcaster bringing us together and looking after us Some of you are laughing, which is disgraceful, evena part of me is tittering too. Once more, you say, Irsquove over-egged the p. Well, maybe, and perhaps I say maybe because the BBC, swayed ironically enough by the market, has lost its way.Over the festive period, from what Irsquove read, its updates of the classics were all swear words, rudeness and mumbling. For some time now, it has tried to become trendy when it should have striven to remain a bastion of decency, something immutable, like the Royal Family, but with fewer sex scandals.I say ldquofrom what Irsquove read because I hardly ever watch it and, indeed, Irsquom fed up paying  or  quid a month to watch half an hour of football every week. I didnrsquot watch one thing over Christmas. I havenrsquot seen one minute of the new BBC Scotland channel. I like BBC Alba, but generally only make an effort to watch it when Hibs are on.Irsquom not getting bang for my Beeb, and have to conclude that only the free market can save us from this state-sponsored robbery. One reads of terrible campaigns of harassment against people who donrsquot pay for a licence on account of the arguably understandable grounds that they donrsquot have a television set.So, whatrsquos the alternative funding model  Well, a voluntary monthly subscription, as happens with Netflix, is the best anyone can come up with. But, from my point of view, it would be better paying a small amount per programme, as I could end up just shelling out  or  quid again to watch  minutes of football.And what sort of BBC would we get anyway  As just another competitor in the market, it could hardly claim to speak for the nation. Would it still strive, on paper, for objectivity  Or has it jettisoned that Platonic ideal already I donrsquot believe that it has, but some reporters definitely let it down. This is particularly noticeable on Twitter, the spasmodic nature of which has unleashed peculiar partialities, asthey were writing while off-duty. Or drunk. Now, at least, the broadcaster is clamping down on their journalists ldquogoing rogue on Twitter.But how could they do such things in the first place  Donrsquot they know theyrsquore supposed to at least strive for objectivity  Donrsquot they get a lecture and a special pack when they join up I donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen to the BBC. EvenI didnrsquot subscribe to it, Irsquod still like to know it was there. But it has to regain its respectability. If itrsquos to go forward in  it must go backward to rediscover a sense of decorum, responsibility and objectivity.It must not lower itself to compete with the shallow, shilpit amateurishness of the other broadcasters such as Channel . But to maintain any kind of quality, it will need cash. And, at the moment, Irsquom sick of giving it mine.Its official: exercise is rubbishIrsquoM making one New Yearrsquos resolution: to go to the gym less. Currently, I go twice a week and what good has it done me  None. Not an inch or an ounce of improvement. Toned, you could say,you were blindfolded in a darkened room.Irsquom fed up with it. Other fellows get muscles, but nothing is ever added to me ndash and nothing taken away. Irsquove lted weights and all manner of Heath-Robinson equipment for years and still have arms like pencils.As for the idea that working out makes you burn calories: does it, aye  All Irsquove done, with regular working out, is put on weight. And, no, it isnrsquot muscle.More news just in: the only way to shed pounds is to stop eating bread and potatoes. I refuse to do either. Le is crap enough as it is.And herersquos another home truth: no amount of yoga, pilates or the gym can change the shape of your body or give you better posture. Thatrsquos determined in adolescence. If you played sports and so forth in adolescence yoursquore probably fine. If, like me, you went about hunched against the world, thatrsquos how you remain. Exercise: itrsquos all rubbish.Join up thinkingAT the time of going to press, Irsquove no plans to join the Army. You titter.

However, I wouldnrsquot recommend it at this time of the year when the emergency services are so stretched.I had been warned. My son said: ldquoBe careful of that candle. I was, for some reason, bending down and trying to poke spent matches through the air hole of the log burner. The fire wasnrsquot alight, so I could have opened it up, but wherersquos the challenge  It was when I tried it for the second time, ignoring the warning, that it happened. Irsquom not sureit was the acrid smell or the heat on my cranium that first indicated that I was on fire.

So I slapped at the smouldering tonsure and then doused the top of my head in Irn-Bru.The smell lingered for hours, at least until my elder daughter came home from a night out with her pals. ldquoWhatrsquos the smell  she asked.ldquoOh, said the boy. ldquoDad set fire to his hair.ldquoOh right, she said and sat down, asit was a normal event.

Nor do I claim that my account is forensic, but it is typical.Wersquove heard about the general shortage of doctors, but, in particular I discovered, there is a chronic lack of both anaesthetists and pathologists. So operations and analyses take longer than they should, which can ndash only occasionally, one hopes ndash result in the curable becoming the fatal.The one common grouse from NHS workers is that there is too much bureaucracy ndash why do we need  health boards, seven specialist ones and one grandiosely and laughably called Healthcare Improvement Scotland, in a country of just five million  ndash and also that politicians just arenrsquot listening, never mind acting.The manest failures at two so-called super-hospitals are well known, but itrsquos the day-to-day ones that escape because they are not headline-grabbing.

I said I wasnrsquot moving, that I wasnrsquot going to go back on the waiting list again, so, judging from original photographs and with my agreement, she went ahead on the likely one.Afterwards she wanted to make a formal complaint about it but I said no, why get some overworked junior into trouble.I just hope that she and all the other NHS staff in Scotland had a happy Christmas.The likelihood is that she, and they, did not."},{"url":null,"title":"resolution-foundation-ten-steps-new-decade","story":" The How Dare You challenge.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Isobel Thompson from Westray has been invited to take part in the naming ceremony for Odin of Scapa and offered the opportunity of a family trip aboard the new tug.Graham Sinclair, chair of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “As names that strongly reflect Orkney’s Norse heritage, these are an excellent choice for the new tugs.“Tugs operated by first class crews play a vital role at the heart of our harbour operations and have helped support the welcome growth in maritime activity we’ve seen in local waters in recent years“I am pleased we are investing in even more capable vessels, which will ensure the continuation of  years of support for the Flotta Terminal and, more recently, the signicant growth in ship to ship work # and allow us to make the most of current and future marine business opportunities, greatly benefiting the economy of the islands.”The design and build contract for the -metre tugs was secured by Sanmar Shipyards of Turkey after a competitive tendering exercise.Construction is taking place at Sanmar’s new specialist tug building facility at Altinova, about an hour south of Istanbul, where work on both tugs is progressing well # as can be seen from the latest photographs taken during a recent inspection by Orkney Marine Services towage staff.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm who can consign the jeremy corbyn era to the dustbin of history","story":"The last thing Labour needs is continuity in its quest for a leader who isn#t embarrassed to be a patriot, says Euan McColmWhen Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party in , he promised a new kind of politics. He certainly delivered that.Now in the grip of a hard-left cabal, Corbyn’s party is a sectarian mess, a safe place for anti-Semites and crank conspiracists. But the leader of the Opposition hasn’t succeeded only in creating a new kind of politics. He has also introduced a new way of losing elections.Clinging to leadershipThere was a time when a leader so comprehensively humiliated in a general election would have resigned immediately, offering profound apologies to all in his party who had been failed by him.Corbyn’s dferent kind of defeat has involved him clinging on to the leadership, arguing – pathetically – that Labour won the argument, and seeing that the advisers who directed the party’s election disaster are signed up to permanent contracts, protecting them from the fate – redundancy – that is now befalling scores of junior staffers.Corbyn says he is remaining in place so that the party can go through a period of reflection on its defeat. Once it is clear what went wrong, he’ll shuffle off and a leadership election will tasked place.This is all bulls**t, of course. Ask any Labour activist why the party lost the general election and,they are honest, they will tell you that the party’s biggest problem was Corbyn. Time and again while canvassing, candidates were told by voters – many of whom had backed Labour all their lives – that they simply couldn’t support the party while he was in charge. Among the reasons were anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, a manesto full of promises that appeared wildly unaffordable, and the leader’s record of siding – throughout history – with the United Kingdom’s enemies.Scottish LabourNow, we witness the pitul efforts of Labour members to persuade themselves that among those who are tipped to run for the top job there are credible candidates who will turn round the party’s fortunes.Labour in Scotland has been in crisis for more than a decade. The SNP has slipped into the political space once occupied by its opponents.But south of the border, things are not yet so bleak for Labour.This will soon changemembers make a foolish decision when it comes to choosing the new leader.In the immediate aftermath of the general election, there was much chatter about the need for Labour to choose a leader who was both northern and female. The logic ran that voters who had turned their nose up at a London-based leader would the leader was someone with whom they could more easily identy.This is nonsense. Voters in the north of England who turned from Corbyn decided to put their faith in Boris Johnson. The flatness of the Labour leader’s vowels has nothing to do with their decision.The Corbyn continuity candidate in the coming leadership election campaign will probably be the wholly unimpressive Rebecca Long Bailey, a northerner who was  per cent behind the sainted Jeremy, even when it was clear he was unfit for office.The importance of patriotismLong Bailey will face challenges from Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, neither of whom has done much to make one think they can turn Labour’s fortunes around. Both seem as distant from the voting public as Corbyn ever did. And both, I’m afraid, are tainted by playing central roles in supporting the Corbyn project which has been so roundly rejected by the electorate.Labour’s media outriders, those columnists and pundits who made careers out of excusing Corbyn’s associations with terrorists and his failure to deal adequately with anti-Semitism, really struggle to deal with the popularity of Johnson with a signicant number of working class voters.At the heart of their confusion lies one of the big problems with the Corbyn project – the failure of its adherents to recognise the importance of patriotism. In dismissing anyone who declares even the slightest affection for the country of their birth as a petty nationalist, the Corbynista offends the small “c” conservative voter who thinks the UK has often been a force for good.Accepting this reality is crucial to the Labour Party’s survival.Swathes of the Labour membership will continue to delude themselves that their man won the argument and that what is needed is a new face to present ideas put forward by Corbyn.But smarter activists will think carefully about how Labour can rebuild a connection with voters who have abandoned the party. The first step in this process is accepting that Labour cannot expect the voters to come to the party. Rather, the party must go to them.Social democratThe new leader should be a social democrat rather than a revolutionary socialist, someone who isn’t ashamed to sing the national anthem, and someone who is as untainted as it is possible to be by association with Corbyn.Were I a member of the Labour Party with a vested interest in its survival, I’d be encouraging Dan Jarvis to step forward. Jarvis, a former soldier, was spoken about as a possible challenger for the leadership when Ed Miliband quit in .Instead of stepping into that fight, Jarvis – MP for Barnsley Central – turned his attention to his local area, campaigning successfully to become mayor of the Sheffield City Region.Jarvis succeeded in the mayoral battle on his own terms, without the patronage of Corbyn.Recently, Jarvis said it was time for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era. That politics had failed, he said, and it was time to start rebuilding credibility.Unsurprisingly, Corbynistas were horried by Jarvis’s remarks. He is not one of them, after all, and is therefore to be treated with a mixture of suspicion and contempt.But Jarvis was right. Labour’s credibility has been shot to Hell by Jeremy Corbyn and a fresh start is essential.If Dan Jarvis does enter the leadership race, he’ll start as an outsider, buthe can reach out beyond the party to the general public and win opinion poll support, he may force Labour members to ask themselves whether it’s time to think about how they start winning again.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

Swimming also saw a  per cent rise with more than , regular participants.A spokesperson for sportscotland said: “Sport has the power to change lives and that is why we are committed to creating more opportunities, particularly for women and girls, to participate in communities across the country. “We will continue to work with our partners across the sector to ensure that everyone benefits from sport and physical activity as part of the world-class sporting system.”The last year has been hailed as one of the best ever for Scottish women in sport. The summer saw history made with Scotland’s women’s football team playing in a World Cup for the first time. A qualying campaign that saw record home attendances, and the rollercoaster manner of their exit from the finals – blowing a three-goal lead over Argentina to draw after defeats to England and Japan – none the less cemented the team in the hearts of Scots sports fans. In the club scene, Glasgow City’s progression to the quarter-finals of the women’s Champions League was another milestone. The domestic game is also set to be overhauled next year with Celtic and Rangers introducing professional and semi-professional set-ups.Hannah Rankin also became Scotland’s first-ever female boxing champion last year, as the -year-old defeated American Sarah Curran in June for the vacant IBO super-welterweight title.Laura Muir cemented her place as one of Scotland’s greatest current athletes. The -year-old stormed to gold in both the ,m and the ,m at the European Indoor Athletics Championship in Glasgow.But the increase comes despite concerns that women’s sport is still largely under-reported by the mainstream media.Research carried out by Edinburgh University’s Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy organisation earlier this year, for the government’s Scottish Women and Girls in Sport Advisory Board, found that as well as a lack of coverage, a “cause for concern” was how female athletes were presented.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#.

What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"ninian scoops window prize for second year running ","story":"There were winners galore in Lerwick town centre on Monday as the top Christmas window was announced and the Elf trail came to an end.Ninian staff receive the trophy for the best Christmas window.

Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers.

Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp opposes call to ban hunting with dogs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Narwhal the unicorn puppy\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A rescue puppy became a global star in November thanks to a second tail growing out of its head.The -week-old dog was taken in by Mac’s Mission – a rescue operation that specialises in helping dogs with special needs – after being found wandering the streets and given the name Narwhal, because the protuberance resembles a tusk.“He’s literally the most magical thing you’ve ever seen, and so happy,” Rochelle Steffen, founder of the Missouri-based rescue centre, told the PA news agency. “He’s just this little anomaly that’s absolutely perfect.”X-rays showed there were no bones in the “tail”, which does not wag and may have been the result of absorbing a twin in the womb.. Mr B the ‘chonk’OMG, big boi Mr. B is a CHONK. He’s a chonk of a chonk. He redefines the term. Can you guess how much he weighs  More importantly, can you give him a home  Adopt this jumbo-sized package of fluff  love: https:t.co vaBPzBbL. Please RT to help this sad-eyed guy find happiness! pic tquRuvRaws— Merry Animal RefugeAugust , An enormous cat looking for a new home became such a big internet star that he crashed the website of the animal shelter where he was living.Morris Animal Refuge, in Philadelphia, in the US, posted pictures of Beejay, also known as Mr B, on its Facebook and Twitter channels, with a link to their site back in August.Unfortunately the cat, who weighed in at  pounds according to the refuge, proved so popular that the volume of traffic heading to find out more crashed the shelter’s website – but that did not stop them receiving more than , applications to adopt the two-year-old.. Wilbur, the king of Ruddington \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Handout photo from the Facebook page of Wilbur – King of Ruddington of the celebrity cat, Wilbur, who has become famous in the village of Ruddington for making himself at home in local shops Wilbur – known as the King of Ruddington – is such a popular figure around his home village that hundreds of locals threw a party to celebrate his th birthday in July.Sadly, Wilbur – famous in the Nottingham village for his visits to local shops – was a no show at the event, which featured a Wilbur cake to Wilbur masks, Wilbur biscuits to a special ginger ale brewed in his honour.“We all knew that he probably wouldn’tbut that’s kind of why we like him – he’s his own cat,” Sarah Godfrey, who organised the bash, told PA.. Charlie the celebrity duckMy duck Charlie was wanting to say hello this morning, but met a barrier of ice. A major hurdle. Then something very surprising happened ... pic bzToAMmWR— Sam NeillJune , Jurassic Park star Sam Neill has built up a following on social media as much for videos of the animals on his farm as for his insights into the movie business.But his video of a duck named Charlie taking flight over a barrier of ice proved particularly popular, with the manoeuvre leaving Neill astonished.“Nobody knew you could fly,” Neill could be heard saying on the video. “You haven’t flown for years. Good girl.”. Kelo the singing parrotStill singing it xlolPosted by Kelo the African Grey on Tuesday, June , A football-loving parrot went viral after squawking one of Liverpool fans’ favourite chants about Mohamed Salah.Four-year-old African grey Kelo was filmed imitating the song, which is heard at Anfield to the tune of James’s  song Sit Down.“Mo Salah, Mo Salah, running down the wing, Salah-la-la-la, the Egyptian king,” Kelo can be heard singing..

We shared it with family and friends and it soon after went viral.”"},{"url":null,"title":"498443","story":"My husband Paul was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease on July , . Paul was . I had never heard of the disease before that day nor knew anything about it. Paul had a very busy job and kept himself very active. He was a painter and decorator. Paul had never been off work sick or never had to attend any hospital appointments.

How were Paul and I going to cope and deal with this devastating disease  Then the angels came.We were introduced to Foyle Hospice in January . Paul started going to the day hospice and almost immediately le seemed to become so much easier to cope with.

However, when Paul became ill he never thought he would be able to visit Old Trafford again. Thanks to his sister Claire and the guidance of the hospice team he was able to visit twice more. Paul met the team, watched them train, attended matches and had a tour of the stadium. Watching his happiness and delight was precious and gave us great memories to hold on to always.‘Amazing people and friends’Paul also spent periods of time in the Inpatient Unit for respite. Our family was able to get away from everything clinical and get a break to recharge ourselves, although Paul was never far from our thoughts. We were confident he was happy and really well looked after. In fact, he was spoiled by both staff in Day Hospice and Inpatient Unit. Paul would be smiling from ear to ear. I also spent many days and nights in the Day Hospice and Inpatient Unit. The warmth, care and the welcome I received was just amazing. I felt so comfortable and made so many wonderful and amazing friends. I used to say, “I feel asI’m in a hotel with no bill to pay on the way out”. Paul said on several occasions he hated this disease buthe could take one good thing from it was the amazing people he met and the friends he made. I second that, it was Foyle Hospice who made that possible.

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in . Among others who have recorded it are Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Chieftains, Daniel ODonnell, The Seekers, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Petula Clark, Jethro Tull, Sineacutead OConnor and Sufjan Stevens, St. Pauls Choir School and most recently by the Irish group Celtic Woman in their album Voices of Angels.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all.

But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks.Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the “New World” and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.”This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.”The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. It is a matter of historical record that Englands King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after the Second World War that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day.An English farmer, Thomas Tusser. noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey, appeared as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That, of course, came in  when Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew.According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year – nine million of those for the Christmas season alone. However, that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the US, three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day.In Norway, for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway, they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany, the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile, in Jamaica Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cllr McPeake said: When I first came into council, this was one of the projects that I inherited, and immediately I sought to get some progress on, meeting with council officials about the possibility of a play park on the site as far back as January. We are all familiar with the many benefits reported from leisure facilities for children, particularly those which encourage outdoor activity, and I think it is important that we make delivery of these sorts of spaces a priority right across our council area. googletag.cmd.push If we are to tackle issues such as mental health problems and obesity, it is vital that we provide our young people with the amenities to allow them to get out and about, and play has been proven as a necessity for childrens development.He added: As part of this project further on down the line, I hope to see further car parking to alleviate the issues which exist currently in ONeill Park, and I will be making a case for delivery of this. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cllr Cusack said it was “reassuring” to have had the officers react so quickly to her request to try tackle the problem by installing surveillance cameras at the “hot spot.” She added: “I know that there’s hardly a street which is not affected by fouling throughout city and district and sympathise with residents and those affected. “However, given there are only a few of these cameras and a lot of resources needed to monitor them, it’s a case of having to prioritise areas.“Hopefully, the public will understand that a school deserves the attention and other areas can be looked at going forward.“There are also limitations with regards to where and how surveil- lance can be conducted. While this may help deter irresponsible owners allowing their dogs to stray and foul, realistically it will not eradicate the problem, it is a mindset which has to change and that is not easy. “I would keep calling on the public to report and assist Environmental Health with any information they may have.”Concluding Councillor Cusack said: “Meanwhile, I will be addressing the prospect of Council investing in more such cameras and resources to combat the problem.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

During the past year there have been a lot of successful partnerships including the Walled City Brewery and Tornion Panimo Brewery in Lapland linking up to create a new Golden Ale and a Gose style beer, following the success of their first collaboration in . There was also the creation of the Derry milk stout sausageand the Foyster stout made using the unique Lough Foyle Irish Flat Oyster.A number of innovative products have also been created, including Grainola Goddess which is made using the special spent grain from the by-product of the brewing process and the first of its type in the world.Jenner O’Donnell, tourism manager with Derry City and Strabane District Council, said  was a hugely successful year in promoting local food produce and celebrating the wealth and quality of the local food industry.She added: “Among the success stories during  was the participation of  companies through  ious innovation projects as part of the Foodovation project.

During the past year there have been a lot of successful partnerships including the Walled City Brewery and Tornion Panimo Brewery in Lapland linking up to create a new Golden Ale and a Gose style beer, following the success of their first collaboration in . There was also the creation of the Derry milk stout sausageand the Foyster stout made using the unique Lough Foyle Irish Flat Oyster.A number of innovative products have also been created, including Grainola Goddess which is made using the special spent grain from the by-product of the brewing process and the first of its type in the world.Jenner O’Donnell, tourism manager with Derry City and Strabane District Council, said  was a hugely successful year in promoting local food produce and celebrating the wealth and quality of the local food industry.She added: “Among the success stories during  was the participation of  companies through  ious innovation projects as part of the Foodovation project. Over half of those companies were from the Derry City and Strabane District Council area and consisted of restaurants or small companies who wanted to develop a retail product.“The LegenDerry Street Food Festival that was held in July was attended by , during the three day festival which was hailed a huge success, while theof the Slow Food Festival as part of the Taste the Island Initiative was widely welcomed and expanded into a five day programme of events and experiences.”James Huey, chairperson of the LegenDerry food and drink network, said he had “no doubt that  will be seen as the year that the city and district experienced a step change in becoming an iconic food destination.”He added: “The launch of the Food Network, which involves the industry working in collaboration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, is a unique model in Ireland. “The benefits of this are already being seen, with the success of the inaugural Street Food Festival, and the incredible events based around the Taste The Island initiative, leading to many tour operators declaring Derry-Londonderry in their top three attractions in the island.”Catherine Goligher, food tourism officer with the Council, said she was “extremely proud” of the achievements of the past year and the success in further developing and promoting Derry and Strabane as a leading food destination.She said the local authority, along with the LegenDerry Food and Drink Network, had hugely ambitious plans for  including the launch of the new LegenDerry Food and drink brand and website in February this year. She added: “We are really excited about this new brand and how it will allow us to showcase our food and drink offering and wealth of local quality produce.“The website will feature all our local food and drink businesses who become accredited under the new brand. “There are set criteria and requirements which must be met to become involved, and these are very important to ensure accredited businesses are fully supporting the brand and development of the food destination. “Businesses accredited will benefit from listing on the website, inclusion within marketing and permission to use the new brand. “We are encouraging all those involved in the food and drink business to get involved, and are keen to work with businesses to work towards accreditation.” Concluding, Ms Goligher said: “We strongly believe that a collaborative approach to promoting our region’s food offering is the best way forward and we look forward to a great ”Businesses interested in becoming accredited can contact Catherine for more information directly at catherine.goligher@derrystrabane .

Over half of those companies were from the Derry City and Strabane District Council area and consisted of restaurants or small companies who wanted to develop a retail product.

There are set criteria and requirements which must be met to become involved, and these are very important to ensure accredited businesses are fully supporting the brand and development of the food destination. Businesses accredited will benefit from listing on the website, inclusion within marketing and permission to use the new brand. We are encouraging all those involved in the food and drink business to get involved, and are keen to work with businesses to work towards accreditation. We strongly believe that a collaborative approach to promoting our region’s food offering is the best way forward and we look forward to a great ”  Businesses interested in becoming accredited can contact Catherine for more information directlycatherine.goligher@ derrystrabane.

The -year old hit  goals for City last season and chipped in with  assists before ing to Colchester United upon the conclusion of his loan deal. Junior now has six months left on his Colchester contract and is currently assessing his options, although he did admit to the Derry News just a few weeks ago that he considered Derry ‘a second home’. Devine is hoping that Junior continues to think that and is desperately hoping that he willto the Brandywell, insisting he can become a huge figure at Derry over the next few years.“We’re desperate to get Junior back,” he admitted. “He’s a player I’ve loved working with and he was another huge cog in our machine last year. I would love to get him back. If he became available I would absolutely love to have him and I’d love to have him here for a couple of years. “I would love him to be the iconic figure that he is again for us because he is an in conic figure in Derry. “Everybody talks about him and he’s a special person as well. He really bought into the whole ethos of the club andhe became available I would walk across to Colchester to sign him.”Devine is more realistic however about the prospects of David Parkhouse coming back to his home town club. The -year old scored  goals and provided  assists in his first season at the Brandywell but has ed to parent club Sheffield United where, like Junior, he is deciding his next move. Devine admits that Derry City is an unlikely option. “I’d love to have Parky back as well but we have to be realistic,” he stated. “The boy is  and he scored a lot of goals last year. I was charting to him last week just as a friend and he’s in training with Sheffield United’s first team which is absolutely brilliant. Boston United and Tamworth didn’t want him this time last year and now he’s in training with a team sitting fth in the Premier League doing really well by all accounts and having fun there. You couldn’t have written that this time last year. He’s been a huge part of our year but at the same time we have to be realistic. Is he really going to come back to Ireland  I don’t think so.” googletag.cmd.push  McCormack Meanwhile, Devine is delighted with his midfield options ahead of the new campaign having brought Conor McCormack back to the club on a two-year deal earlier this week. “We’ve signed three established players and three high-profile players but the pleasing thing for me was that they all wanted to come to the club,” he explained. “It was so easy to bring Conor to the club. He was willing to come here, there’s European football and he wants to challenge at the top. That remains to be seen but at the same time, filling your squad with that high quality player that is key to us, “Last year we had  players who picked themselves throughout the season, but this year we have to have more depth and high levels of quality throughout the group. There’s a lot of quality in the squad now.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Evan Tweed and Brendan McLaughlin were on the wings, as Cormac Burke – who starred against the Swts – picked up the number ten role behind McCready.‘Stute started with intent, and a deflection off Emmett Bennett inside his own half fell kindly for Aidan McCauley who broke into the box, but the centre half recovered well to block the shot away for a corner that came to nothing.The home side came within inches of making it one nil on six minutes when a superb crossfield pass from Evan Tweed picked out Brendan McLaughlin at the back post. He skipped inside on to his right foot before trying to curl it to the bottom corner, but Mark Byrne was equal to it with a ing save.They were dealt a blow on  minutes when Derry City loanee Tweed was forced off with an ankle problem, with Shane McNamee subbed on in his place.Warrenpoint had the ball in the net on  minutes when an acrobatic clearance from Byrne was met with a flicked header by Alan O’Sullivan for Brandon Doyle running off the shoulder of Conor Tourish, but the linesman raised his flag before the ball left the Town man’s boot.At the other end, Brendan McLaughlin had a golden chance to put his side in the lead when Crown played a one two off McCready from a throw before dinking it into the box for the Donegal man – who had drted between Anton Reilly and Bennett – but from ten yards out he could only head over the top.A slick team move then ended with Burke trying an ambitious chip from the right sideline after spotting Byrne out of position, but it bounced harmlessly wide of the left upright.Sean Connor’s men were well and truly dominating, and on  minutes McCready had his first chance when he beat the offside trap and raced away from Bennett to latch on to Dean Curry’s pass, but after twisting and turning in the box the striker fired straight at Byrne – with the Blues unable to do anything with the rebound.In added time, ‘Stute came close again when McNamee showed great awareness to latch on to the loose ball down the right before fizzing a cross across the face that was just inches away from the boot of the incoming McCready.The first period was played almost entirely in Warrenpoint’s half, but a combination of some poor finishing and decision-making, and some bad luck, meant that ‘Stute went in frustrated, and level, and the break. googletag.cmd.push Half-timeInstitute Warrenpoint  ‘Stute picked up where they left off with a shot on target off the boot of Cormac Burke inside the first minute, but it was never troubling Byrne from  yards.Joe McCready flashed one wide from a tight angle before passing up a huge chance on  minutes when Burke’s first-time ball across the face found the striker completely free at the back post, but he skied it over off his weaker left foot.Mark Byrne was thanking his lucky stars seconds later when he completely misjudged the bounce on a long Colm McLaughlin pass, but as it evaded the goalkeeper with McCready closing in, Warrenpoint captain Daniel Wallace was alert enough to get across and clear.Burke found the chest of Byrne once again with a half volley on the hour mark before, out of nowhere, Lorcan Forde found himself through on goal but took too long to get the ball down and Dean Curry hacked it away.The game flipped on its head on  minutes when, completely against the run of play and with their first shot on goal, the visitors took the lead. It was the simplest of goals too, as O’Sullivan pulled out to the right wing before driving a ball in that Eamon Scannell, in acres of space, finished from seven yards.The home side thought they had levelled matters two minutes later when McLaughlin nodded McCauley’s dinked pass over Byrne, but the flag was raised for offside.‘Stute continued to enjoy a lot of the ball in the final stages, but they couldn’t fashion any chances as Warrenpoint took a huge three points back home.If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening. Bredaghrsquos John Devaney becomes the st holder of the countyrsquos main position, having been selected unopposed to succeed Mayobridge man Sean Rooney.In his first address to delegates, Mr Devaney outlined a strategic vision for the association in the county and a number of areas of focus for his term of office.The key priorities will be the proposed Centre of Excellence, the development of a new coaching plan, recruitment of referees, and a programme to encourage and nurture new and young administrators.Following his election, Devaney said: ldquoThe Ballykinlar Centre of Excellence is clearly the single biggest project that we will have undertaken, and will take time and resource to bring to fruition. ldquoWe have set out our intention and we are determined that it will happen, because it is a fantastic opportunity for the county. But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since .

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you. Itrsquos best done before the night is out.ldquoAlso, I say that having a bit of good manners helps, to say thank you and to appreciate what we do for each other..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Downpatrick man.jpg","title":"Downpatrick man in roll of honour  ","story":"FORMER Downpatrick and Ireland cricket captain Alfie Linehan was included in a prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who died during .He was among  from around the world listed as lsquospecial peoplersquo in BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme broadcast at the weekend.They included England goalkeeper Gordon Banks and racing driver Niki Lauda as well as another cricketer mdash one of Englandrsquos greatest fast bowlers, Bob Willis.Alfie died in June after suffering dementia and contracting cancer.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

They were due to meet the architects this week, but instead were sent a written report on the progress being made.The council clerk, Mr Seamus Byrne, read the report at a council meeting on Monday and said he expected a completion date early in the new year. In the report the architects catalogued a series of setbacks over the past two years and blamed most of the delay on strikes and shortages of materials.Downpatrick councillor, Mr Sean Quinn, launched into a scathing attack on the architects, who, he said, had failed to serve the council as they as they should.Mr Quinn said he found it disturbing that the architects must have known of the troubles on the site, yet had still made ldquowild predictions about the proposed opening date.Mr Quinn also condemned the mounting costs of work on the scheme and then drew attention to the pool itself, saying he felt the interior design was lacking in imagination.Mr Cecil Maxwell reminded councillors that they had approved the pool design and he did not think the architects were at fault for the slow progress.DROMARA mdash ADromara schoolgirl flies out to London tomorrow to represent Northern Ireland in a major essay competition.

He said that in the light of the ldquoBrexit catastrophe, people stood up and put the interests of people in the constituency to the fore.Conceding that he expected his vote to decease, the ing MP said that he was delighted to top the poll, highlighting the need to get Stormont up and running again.ldquoIt is important that we have locally devolved institutions.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

If and when an Assembly election happens, we will certainly be putting a lot of effort into securing a seat in South Down.Mr Brown said he went into the election with the intention of building on the partyrsquos best ever performance in a Westminster poll two years ago when it secured , votes.ldquoWe wanted this election to be our best ever result and we have done that, he declared.ldquoI would say that we knocked more doors in  than in this election as I was responsible for the partyrsquos social media and digital marketing campaign. As a result, my time was split between South Down and helping out in other areas including North Down and East Belfast.ldquoI know that working full time on an election campaign in South Down we can achieve an even better result. I also know that a lot of our voters did vote tactically and respect their decision to do so.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
