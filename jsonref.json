[{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan reveal considering return UK christen Lilibet","story":"Share this articleHe said: \u0027It seems certain that her christening will be in Meghan\u0027s home state and with the secrecy but without the controversy that surrounded Archie\u0027s christening.\u0027 The couple have never released an image of their daughter to the public, with royal commentator Richard saying the decision shows the Duke and Duchess are acting on their own terms.The latest claims come after it was revealed that Prince Harry was not expected to return to Britain next week to join his brother Prince William at a party to honour their mother. The party had originally been planned for July 1, when the brothers unveiled a statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, on what would have been her 60th birthday.Prince Harry flew back for the unveiling without wife Meghan, who had given birth to the couple\u0027s second child, Lilibet.Due to coronavirus restrictions, the plans were scaled back, with just the Princes, their uncle Earl Spencer and aunts Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes present.Harry was due to attend the rescheduled party for 100 guests, believed to include Sir Elton John, on October 19, although it is unclear if Meghan would have accompanied him.However sources this week said it was not expected he would return for this. Since attending the statue\u0027s unveiling, Harry has announced he is writing his memoirs. They are due for release next year, when the Queen will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne. In February a spokesperson for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry confirmed the couple were expecting a second child together. The couple shared their announcement - aptly on Valentine\u0027s Day - by posting a black and white image of Harry resting his hand on Meghan\u0027s head as she lay in his lap underneath a tree.\u0027The photograph of the Duke and Duchess was was taken by the couple\u0027s longtime friend Misan Harriman. What wonderful news for the Sussexes!!\u0027 their spokesperson added. Lilibet – whose middle name is Diana – was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in June.    It is understood the Queen was informed by Prince Harry that her great grandchild would be named in her honour, ahead of their official announcement which was made on their official website. However, Buckingham Palace appeared to be caught off guard by the timing of the Sussexes\u0027 news with a spokesman for the palace congratulating the couple 90 minutes after the announcement broke.    Omid Scobie, a journalist favoured by Harry and Meghan, later tweeted that the couple would \u0027not be sharing a photograph at this time\u0027 of Lilibet and that they were now on \u0027parental leave\u0027. He said the couple\u0027s office was encouraging anyone who wanted to send gifts to support organisations working for women and girls. The name Lilibet was coined by the Queen and used by her younger sister Margaret and their parents. George VI once said: \u0027Lilibet is my pride. Margaret is my joy.\u0027Lilibet arrived six days before what would have been the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 100th birthday."},{"url":null,"title":"Elon Musk slashes price Bay Area mansion 5 5m 32m vowing rid possessions","story":"Share this articleBloomberg - Are you a robot?Elon Musk and Grimes break up after three years together"},{"url":null,"title":"Waterstones blasted selectively censoring books feminism","story":"Share this article\u0027Some inidual shops will have sold out, as is always the case with inidual titles.

Photograph: Sasko LazarovRollingNews.ieMinisters will push for a partial easing of Covid-19 restrictions next week which could see vaccination passports remain in place as a requirement for entering venues and premises.There are mounting concerns in Government and among public health officials about the rising number of Covid-19 cases and the high number of patients in hospital.While no decisions have been made yet about the next phase of reopening on October 22nd, senior sources have acknowledged that some of the measures may be paused if the situation continues to deteriorate. One proposal is to remove some restrictions, while keeping the requirement to show proof of vaccination before entering a business.The Government will closely monitor the data this weekend before making a final decision next Monday or Tuesday. Booster shotThe National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) is also due to meet in the coming days to discuss a possible booster shot campaign. There is growing impatience in Government at the pace of those deliberations as some Ministers believe it is imperative that the booster campaign is expanded as early as possible. One option is that the rollout would be offered in a descending order down through the age cohorts.Many health experts, however, say there is insufficient evidence to support a mass rollout of booster vaccines.“We have to weigh up additional vaccine doses extremely carefully,” Prof Mary Keogan of Beaumont Hospital told a symposium in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland on Thursday.“We know two doses of vaccine provide protection against severe disease in the vast majority of the population. We don’t know if a three-dose schedule will improve response or durability of the protection we get.”“At a time when most of the world is not vaccinated we really can’t afford that luxury,” said Prof Keogan, adding that “we need to be mindful of our responsibility to use this precious resource prudently” when much of the global population was unvaccinated.‘Middle way’On the potential easing of restrictions on October 22nd, a Government source said that there might be a “middle way” of easing some restrictions, but not all of them, and this could involve opening up for only the fully vaccinated and recovered. There is a feeling that this could encourage more people to get vaccinated or get their second shot if they haven’t done so.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris on Thursday suggested an extension of the digital Covid certificate beyond October 22nd as a safer way of society fully reopening.There are fears in Government that some indoor hospitality venues are no longer enforcing the requirement for Covid certificates for entry, and also a wider sense that compliance with Covid regulations and advice has begun to diminish. Against this backdrop, there is considerable unease in Government about reopening nightclubs, as well as the return of late opening hours for bars.With a further 1,627 cases confirmed on Thursday, there are fears of waning immunity, especially among people who did not return to get their second dose of the vaccine. Officials believe that some people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine in the early months of the programme did not get a second dose, including some healthcare workers.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

we can only begin to guess what might come next.The seller of the artwork, who placed the £1 million winning bid on Girl With Balloon, previously described the shredding of the artwork as surreal.They added that he became the accidental - but very privileged - owner of Love Is In The Bin.In March, Banksy raised more than £16 million for health projects by auctioning Game Changer, a hand-painted image showing a young boy playing with superhero dolls.While Batman and Spiderman are discarded in a bin, the child clutches a figure of a masked nurse wearing a cape.More from NewsEU Ambassador to the UK: When you play football, you need the referee -

But the future heir’s tart response to Jeff Bezos flying William Shatner to space this week – “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” the Duke of Cambridge said – had echoes of Scott-Heron’s influential 1970 spoken-word track, Whitey on the Moon.Over clattering percussion, Scott-Heron pretty much nailed the disinterested shrug of people at the hard end of the world’s problems at seeing Neil Armstrong’s landmark 1969 moon walk: “A rat done bit my sister Nell, with Whitey on the moon. Her face and arms began to swell, and Whitey’s on the moon,” his languid vocals proclaim.Certainly, at first sight, the regular transport of wealthy people into low Earth orbit – a prospect now closer than ever – seems like the answer to a question the planet wasn’t asking.SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket burns kerosene and Virgin’s VSS Unity uses a solid carbon-based fuel, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and liquid nitrous oxide. Which, Eloise Marais, associate professor of physical geography at University College London, estimates burn 200-300 tonnes of carbon dioxide per launch. Split between four or so passengers, this compares highly unfavourably with the one to three tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger for long-haul flights. While there were only 114 rocket launches in the whole of 2020, Sir Richard Branson’s ambition alone is for 400 flights per year.But might such forays have their uses for the whole of mankind after all?Space travel and the environmental movement have been strange bedfellows ever since the Pioneer 1 satellite used the first practical solar panels in 1958. Satellites have been driving innovation in solar panels ever since, and have proven crucial in determining crop health, forest fires, glacier coverage, the spread of urban development and damage to the rainforests.Indeed, space travel has been a rich source of new green tech. The hydrogen and fuel cell technologies invented to take Apollo astronauts into space are now touted as a clean, reliable (albeit achingly expensive) alternative to batteries that can power anything from aeroplanes, such as the Pathfinder and Helio prototypes, to warships. Home insulation – hello there, Insulate Britain – owes much to spacesuit design.Meanwhile, NASA is a leader in green engineering. By necessity, all human space travel involves recycling practically everything – water, air and food – so the space agency has been responsible for breakthroughs in water filtration, waste water treatment and soil cleaning agents. It is also one of the world’s biggest researchers into the science of hydroponics – growing crops without using land resources.“Space-based technologies and space-derived information are central to climate knowledge, science, monitoring and early warning,” says Nick Shave, chair of UKspace, the trade association of the British space industry. “In the future, new applications of satellite data, combined with satellite positioning and communications technologies, will help drive down carbon emissions as well as providing key capabilities required to manage the devastating effects of the climate emergency to countries and communities around the world.”The link between the environment and space travel is even more far-out than that. Bill Anders, crew member of the Apollo 8 mission, became the first human to witness the Earth peeking over the Moon’s horizon in 1968. Anders had been snapping the Moon’s surface on a scouting mission for future landings when he took the photograph later known as Earthrise. That single snap is credited with inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970, about which Anders later said: “We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.”California’s environmental movement of the early 1970s gave birth to the Whole Earth Catalogue, a compendium of product listings, how-to diagrams and educational ephemera intended for the back-to-the-land movement, which featured Earthrise on its first cover. Published quarterly in 1971 and sporadically thereafter, its biggest influence was on Silicon Valley: founders of Airbnb, Stripe and Facebook, early-internet architects including Larry Brilliant, Lee Felsenstein, Ted Nelson and Steve Jobs, described the Catalog as “Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along”.This freak-powerbillionaire crossover means that while SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy emits more CO2 in a few minutes than the average car would in more than two centuries, in 2019 it carried a NASA-funded test satellite known as the Green Propellant Infusion Mission, to replace the outrageously polluting and ferociously lethal hydrazine. The new hydroxyl ammonium nitrate fueloxidizer blend – called AF-M315E for short – can be carried around without wearing a hazmat suit, is more efficient and emits more water than CO2.By comparison, Bezos’s rocket, Blue Origin, is powered by a mix of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, meaning its carbon footprint – in flight, if not in construction – is zero. Given Blue Origin’s reusable launch vehicle, the project’s biggest overall source of CO2 is likely to be the crew and passengers’ flights to its Texas launch site. Just don’t mention the CO2 given off by Amazon’s server farms…And then there’s the real out-there thinking of Elon Musk. Musk has credited his drive to many things – including growing up in apartheid South Africa and leaving aged 17, rather than serve in what he called “a fascist army” – but the man’s absolute conviction that the Earth is doomed explains his unsettling desire to move to Mars.“A lot of my motivation comes from looking at things that don’t work well and feeling a bit sad about how it would manifest in the future,” he has said. “If that would result in an unhappy future, then it makes me unhappy, so I want to fix it.”Alongside the Tesla, the car that made electric vehicles cool at last, he’s proposed ‘Hyperloop’ high-speed transportation systems, using reduced pressure tubes to reach speeds around 600mph – which Branson has neatly whipped from under his nose with the all-electric Virgin Hyperloop’s first successful test earlier this year. Musk has put up $100 million for carbon capture technology, and given up on cryptocurrencies due to their voracious dependency on electricity.The UK is clinging on to the edge of all this. British rocket maker Orbex is pioneering bio-propane fuel that chief executive Chris Larmour says can cut CO2 emissions by 90 per cent, compared with traditional launch fuel. “Climate change is real, and we don’t want to make it worse,” he explains.After Brexit, the UK is no longer part of Galileo and EGNOS, the EU-owned satnav systems, but we’re hustling to get involved in its Copernicus Earth Observation programme, and we’ve still got a role in the soon-to-be carbon-neutral European Space Agency. “The UK has already taken a lead in committing to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” says Shave. “The next step should be properly investing in our space industry to help us become a world leader in action as well as words.”If we start to dream of space again, perhaps we can start to get a genuinely global perspective. If we can solve problems down here by trying to put someone on the Moon, what could we achieve if we all got a chance to see Earth rise?More from NewsEU Ambassador to the UK: When you play football, you need the referee - which is European Court of Justice‘Huge distress and anxiety’ as over half of blood cancer patients yet to be offered booster Covid jabCambridge University abandons proposed £400m partnership with UAE over hacking claimsThe  weekly news quiz: What was the PM pictured doing on holiday?Bill Clinton taken to hospital in California with blood infectionOne is not amused: Queen irritated by those who ‘talk but don’t do’ ahead of Cop26More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"masterpiece worthy monet","story":"Standing on a \u0027Monet bridge\u0027, visitors to Cornwall\u0027s Trebah Gardens might well feel like they are immersed in a living masterpiece by the French impressionist. Despite being deep into autumn, Mallard Pond is a work of art with a stunning display of mostly blue hydrangeas. Two acres of hydrangeas border its banks, creating a wall of colour in late summer months and seen in this photograph as dotted pastels across the landscape.They were originally planted in 1949.

Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said it would be a massive relief to families desperate to get away this autumn and was a major step forward that will support the desperately needed recovery of our sector.Only unvaccinated travellers now have to take a pre-departure test and then quarantine for 10 days on their return and pay for PCR tests on days two and eight of their return.

I can’t hear Robert clearly from where I’m sat, but I can hear enough to know that he’s not on top of his game. Ditto Jimmy. “I don’t remember playing Rock And Roll, but obviously I did. But I do remember an awful lot of time where I can hear what Robert decries as ‘knitting’: fancy drumming. “And if you can find the footage (the Zeppelin camp have done their best to scrub it from the history books), you can see me miming, playing the air, getting out of the way lest there be a trainwreck.“If I’d known it was to be a two-drummer band, I would have removed myself from proceedings long before I got anywhere near Philadelphia.”More from NewsEU Ambassador to the UK: When you play football, you need the referee - which is European Court of Justice‘Huge distress and anxiety’ as over half of blood cancer patients yet to be offered booster Covid jabCambridge University abandons proposed £400m partnership with UAE over hacking claimsThe  weekly news quiz: What was the PM pictured doing on holiday?Bill Clinton taken to hospital in California with blood infectionOne is not amused: Queen irritated by those who ‘talk but don’t do’ ahead of Cop26More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bernard henri levy cancel culture churning imbeciles","story":"“I’ll tell you what cancel culture is,” says Bernard-Henri Lévy. “It’s a school of imbecility churning out ever more imbeciles. And it’s profoundly dangerous.” I hadn’t imagined the French “rock star” philosopher would be a fan, but this is gold. In a climate where interviewees are all too often fearful of saying the wrong thing and opinions are watered down to nothing, a conversation with the man known only as BHL in France is as robust and satisfying as a Sunday roast. And he’s only just getting started. “Every relationship we have with another human being should be both welcoming and worrying,” Lévy goes on, warming to his theme. “It’s essential to have both, and for your convictions to be challenged and imperiled by another’s. So in that way cancel culture goes against the very contract of life it’s the opposite of life – and living.”With his trademark black Charvet suit, crisp white shirt (still unbuttoned, if not quite to the navel these days), and of course the baroque hairstyle that inspired one satirist’s line “God is dead, but my hair is beautiful”, the wealthy son of a timber magnate looks perfectly at home in the softly-lit Knightsbridge hotel bar in which we meet. Yet this is a man who has spent the past 50 years travelling to war-torn countries across the world, a man who somehow even managed to get to Bangladesh (catching the last plane out when the first lockdown was announced), the Greek island of Lesbos and Afghanistan over the course of the pandemic. And his forthcoming book, The Will To See: Dispatches from a World of Misery and Hope, charts the terrifying and inspiring scenes and people he came across on those travels.Before we get to the big battles, however – the ones that really matter – I’m curious to know how he feels about another little clash: the one going on right now between our two countries, after a recent series of diplomatic spats. “You know Brexit really wounded us,” he tells me. “It’s not that I feel there’s any real resentment for Brits out in France… It’s more of a disappointed love.” But that wound can heal? “Oh, France and England will always find a way to meet in the middle. And Brexit might not be forever. Johnson won’t necessarily be there for much longer, will he? So maybe then our friendship can be reborn.” Ask Lévy what he thinks of our Prime Minister, and a small smile plays on his lips. “We crossed paths when he was a journalist and in Brussels…” And? “There’s a word you Brits use: ‘jolly’.” It’s said with a moue of distaste. “Well, he’s ‘a jolly guy’.” But do you want a jolly guy in charge of the country? “I don’t. But hey, maybe British people do.”When you’ve witnessed the kinds of things BHL has in Eritrea, Bosnia or Afghanistan – which he has visited seven times over the years – one can see why “jolly” might be given short shrift. Yet in The Will To See he writes that he never experiences “any real fear, nor any special pride in not fearing”.Over the course of previous trips Lévy had got to know the legendary commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, who was assassinated by the Taliban in 2001. But until last year he hadn’t seen the former resistance leader’s eldest son since he was a boy. “I spent hours with him last year and he talked a lot about his heritage. I was struck by the physical and moral resemblance: the strength of his desire to carry on his father’s work, as well as by his sense of duty. It’s always surprising to see someone who is not made for war deciding to enter into one. Because this is a man who likes gardening and astrology – a man who is not made for war.”Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan in August was “infuriating” for two reasons, he tells me. “Firstly, because Biden didn’t actually have to follow through with Trump’s plan. He reversed a lot of Trump’s decisions, so why not that one? That was the first catastrophic error. And secondly because of the way in which he did it.”The oft-touted concept of a “forever war” “is absurd”, Lévy scoffs. “It wasn’t a ‘forever war’ but a military and diplomatic presence there to dissuade Islamists from coming back and setting up their Al-Qaeda training camps again – to stop them preparing new attacks against Afghan women and the West.” In which case that presence should have remained there forever? “Why wouldn’t you? America has been in Germany for 75 years and in South Korea for the past 50. How many American military bases are there all over the world? Leaving 2500 men in Afghanistan was not absurd. My theory on interventionalism has always been this: it will inevitably cost more not to intervene – and in every sense. In lives, in money, in honour.”On his first visit to the country in 1981, Lévy helped set up Radio Free Kabul. Then in 2002, when sent by former president Jacques Chirac on an official mission to find ways of building a nation out of the chaos left by the Taliban and American bombs, the philosopher created and financed one of the first free papers in Afghanistan, the now-defunct News of Kabul. So he’s deeply saddened by the way the media have chosen to concentrate on the “evil” West rather the heinous acts perpetrated by the Taliban.“People have lost all sense – all intelligence! No society is perfect, but the Taliban are the absolute worst,” he says with a shake of the head. “And there had been so much improvement. I had seen first-hand a civil society affirming itself, a democratic revolution that was starting to spread. There was a flourishing of the press and a very large number of women had started to liberate themselves. So I’m absolutely shocked by the idea that ‘we failed in Afghanistan’. We did not fail. There were errors and failures of course: there was money lost to corruption and a bad president. But having that presence there had meant an extraordinary eclosion, which I had personally witnessed.”In his book, Lévy makes the point that “even the most archaic cultures” can evolve and reform themselves, alongside religions. “Think about it. Christianity reformed itself, Judaism reformed itself, and Islam is absolutely compatible with French or British cultures. It too can reform itself. But we need to stop seeing cultures as blocks,” he insists. “Back in Voltaire’s time drawing and quartering was still practised in France, but thankfully there were Frenchmen who believed that particular practice should be removed from our culture. Similarly, the death penalty existed in our country until 1981. England was once a chauvinist country, imbued with racism, but look at you now! Then there’s the American way of life, which is absolutely respectable, but the possession of weapons of war is not consubstantial with their culture. So why the moment we start to talk about poor countries do certain cultural aspects become sacred things that one cannot touch? It’s madness.”I’m aware that time is pressing and that Lévy’s publicist is ready to whisk him off to an event before he heads back to Paris, but before she does I want to know about the second part of the equation in his book title. The “misery” is all too clear to see, after all. But where does he see “hope”? “Oh I’ve found hope in the least humane places: in the refugee camps of Lesbos, for example, where I saw people who had lost everything able to stand up straight and keep their dignity. When you see the incredible resistance human beings can have to everything that has tried to destroy them? That is the incarnation of hope.” And with that, BHL vanishes into the night.The Will To See by Bernard-Henri Lévy is published by Yale University Press on 26th October. £16.99.More from NewsEU Ambassador to the UK: When you play football, you need the referee - which is European Court of Justice‘Huge distress and anxiety’ as over half of blood cancer patients yet to be offered booster Covid jabCambridge University abandons proposed £400m partnership with UAE over hacking claimsThe  weekly news quiz: What was the PM pictured doing on holiday?Bill Clinton taken to hospital in California with blood infectionOne is not amused: Queen irritated by those who ‘talk but don’t do’ ahead of Cop26More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Friday.

Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said: “This is great news and we’re pleased to get it over the line in time for the crucial half-term period, which will be a massive relief to families desperate to get away this autumn. “Vaccinated passengers can be reassured that they do not need to book or take an expensive PCR test when theyto the UK, which will further reduce the cost of travel.” He added: “This is a major step forward that will support the desperately needed recovery of our sector.” The rule change means fully-vaccinated passengers and most under-s arriving in England from countries not on the red list can take a lateral flow test on or before day two of their arrival into the UK.  Passengers must upload a photo of their test to prove results as soon as possible, with free PCR tests for any positive cases. Mr Javid said: “We want to make going abroad easier and cheaper, whether you’re travelling for work or visiting friends and family. “Lateral flow tests will be available later this month for those ing from half term holidays. “This change to testing is only possible thanks to the incredible progress of our vaccination programme, which means we can safely open up travel as we learn to live with the virus.”  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps added: “Today’s rule changes will make testing on arrival simpler and cheaper for people across the country who are looking forward to well-earned breaks for this October half term. “Taking away expensive mandatory PCR testing will boost the travel industry and is a major step forward in normalising international travel and encouraging people to book holidays with confidence.” Passengers who are not fully-vaccinated and are landing from a non-red list nation must still take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on days two and eight and complete  days self-isolation.

Tory environment Lord Benyon said on Thursday an announcement was imminent and the Government was poised to back down on restrictions for meat industry workers. It comes after farming leaders warned , pigs could be destroyed as a labour shortage has led to a backlog of animals ready for slaughter. Farms are struggling to find space for the extra pigs - leaving them with no choice but to cull them in the face of overcrowding concerns. Pressed about the issue in the House of Lords, Lord Benyon told peers the Governmentaposs plan would mirror emergency measures announced last month for the poultry industry. Those included , temporary visas for workers and , tforHGV drivers in an attempt to prevent shortages in the run-up to Christmas.  Labour frontbencher Baroness Jones of Whitchurch highlighted the latest editorial in Pig World magazine, which was scathing of the Governmentaposs handling of the current crisis, accusing it of arrogance and incompetence.She said: The fact is there are , pigs which are unable to be slaughtered for consumption and already farmers have had to cull and destroy over , healthy pigs. Talking is great, but when is the Government going to provide those temporary visas and the lower language requirements for skilled butchers which lie at the root of this crisis  Responding, Lord Benyon said: We care deeply about this sector, the people that work in it, the welfare of the animals concerned, and want nothing more than to smooth out the perfect storm of a iety of dferent issues which have brought this to a head at this particular time. I had hoped to be able to come to the House with an announcement - it is imminent. I think she will be pleased with the hard work that ministers and officials have put in to show that we do care and we want this industry to get back on its feet. Referring to labour problems in the industry, he said: These are principally because, at the end of the Covid restrictions, many of the overseas workers ed home and we are seeking to find ways of bringing large numbers of them back.  There is a deficit of between  and , butchers we want to fill. Liberal Democrat Baroness Bakewell of Hardington Mandeville said: It is heartbreaking to raise stock from piglets to fully grown pigs ready for slaughter and the supermarket shelves, only to have to cull them on farm and their meat be wasted. An influx of skilled workers from abroad could alleviate the situation. What is the minister doing to lower the English language requirement for mat processing workers who clearly do not need the same level of fluency as a GP  Lord Benyon said: Part of our discussions, and the announcement I hope will be able to be made imminently, reflects what is also done in the poultry industry where those changes were made to encourage more workers to come over and operate in that sector. And we hope that this will alleviate the labour problems in this sector. Labour peer Baroness Hayman of Ullock said: The Governmentaposs response, including the Prime Ministeraposs, to this crisis has been pretty hopeless, to put it mildly, so far. Unfortunately, it has been catastrophic to many pig farmers already because the Government has taken so long to act.

The Government has insisted it has already learned lessons from the pandemic. Ministers have also pointed to a public inquiry due to begin next spring. Critics want it to start immediately. Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who took up the role in June after Matt Hancock was forced to resign for breaking social distancing rules during an affair with his aide, was asked todayhe was sorry for failures which occurred.He said: “Yes, of course I’m sorry. “Obviously I am new in the role, but on behalf of the Government I am sorry for, during the pandemic, anyone that suffered, especially anyone that lost a loved one, a mother, a dad, a brother, a sister, a friend. Of course I am sorry for that.  “Also, all those people that may not have lost someone but they are still suffering - there are many people sadly suffering from long Covid, we still don’t know the impact of that. Of course I am. “There will be lessons to learn from this pandemic for this Government, for governments across the world, there will be lessons. It is important that is done. “There is going to be a public inquiry and I think that is the best place to learn these lessons.” Asked later what mistakes he was apologising for, he said: “I don’t know all the lessons that we are going to have to learn about this - I don’t think anyone does at this point. “I think the best place to determine those will be the independent public inquiry.” Comment MORE ON Keir StarmerPoliticsTory GovernmentCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Government vowed to issue , temporary visas to HGV drivers and another , to poultry workers in the run up to the festive period to prevent Christmas misery for families. But top Tory Oliver Dowden admitted only  visas had actually been issued and there had been just  applicants. MPs were told last night that the application process takes a minimum of three weeks - meaning drivers applying now are being drafted in for only two months. Retailers have been warning of higher prices and Christmas shortages amid ongoing supply issues, partly caused by an acute shortage of HGV drivers, as well as pandemic restrictions and poor weather.  The UK is also experiencing delays in ports, including Felixstowe where container ships have experienced congestion. Tory chairman Mr Dowden said the number of foreign drivers coming forward to get temporary visas was relatively limited. He told LBC: We have  people that have applied for these visas.I believe the number is just over  that actually received them, so are on the road, but I expect that number to increase over time. Meanwhile, Home Office minister Kevin Foster told MPs that applications for HGV food drivers and poultry workers will be processed in a minimum of  working days - or three weeks. This means that poultry workers who can only stay until  December will only be able to stay in the country for around two months.Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: It is shocking that while supermarket shelves are going empty and our ports are gridlocked, visa applications are still taking three weeks or more to be processed. “It means some workers will only be allowed in the country for as little as two months by the time their application has been approved. It’s little wonder so few people are taking up the offer to work here under the Conservatives’ botched visa scheme.“Ministers must end this farce, speed up visa applications and put in place a fair immigration system that enables businesses to recruit the skilled workers they need. Otherwise, Boris Johnsonaposs vow to save Christmas risks joining his ever growing list of broken promises.Chancellor Rishi Sunak tried to reassure people worried about getting their Christmas supplies. Speaking to the BBC in Washington, he said: Weaposre doing absolutely everything we can to mitigate some of these challenges. They are global in nature so we canapost fix every single problem but I feel confident there will be good provision of goods for everybody. Iaposm confident there will be a good amount of Christmas presents available for everyone to buy.

The COP meeting in Glasgow has been described as the final chance to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures but, as Her Majesty pointed out yesterday, there is too much talking and not enough action. Some world leaders, such as Australia’s Scott Morrison and President Xi Jinping of China, have not even decidedthey will attend. If the Scottish summit fails to agree binding targets for reducing emissions, the consequences for Earth will be disastrous. We will be bequeathing our children and grandchildren a planet where droughts, flooding and extreme weather are the norm. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Large parts of the world will become uninhabitable. Rising sea levels could wipe out farmland to grow essential food supplies. It is a shame that other leaders do not share the Royal Family’s understanding of how urgent these issues are. If they fail in Glasgow, future generations will never forgive them. Artful dodger Boris Johnson scuttled back from his holiday today to a struggling country. While he was playing with his paintbrush, families and firms faced supply disruption and soaring costs of energy and other essentials. Sir Keir Starmer is right to say the Prime Minister needs to step up to the plate and stop dodging responsibility for the multiple problems facing this country.

But Lord West, who commanded HMS Ardent in the  Falklands War, feared the Navy fleet would dip below  frigates.  He added: “The Government said that we would have and keep a minimum of  frigates - which is, after all, pretty damning for a maritime nation like us.“When one looks at the order rate for frigates, and the possibility of the rolling programme which so many shipyards need, one has to say that we are not going to have  frigates as we move into this decade.”He added: “As someone with an intelligence background, I would think it would be considerably less.”Defence Minister Baroness Goldie did not dispute the warning. But she told peers that “we have for the first time in  years two classes of frigate simultaneously under construction in UK shipyards”.  She added: “The Ministry of Defence expects to place an order for the batch two Type  frigates in the early s and to award a manufacture for the Fleet Solid Support shipswithin two years from May . “The Defence Secretary has said that he aims to have the National Flagship in the water by  or . “No decisions have yet been taken on order dates ... for the Type  frigates.” Mocking Government pledges of a British shipbuilding revival, Lord West told the Upper House: “It sounds marvellous and indeed having a Prime Minister who says that nothing does more for the security of our nation than building a warship for the Royal Navy obviously cheers a sailor like me up. “But the reality is that  months ago he made these statements and not a single order has been placed since then.”  He said that in  years “on the active list” he was “scarred” by “hearing numerous things about ships coming and never joining the Fleet”.Former Defence Minister Kevan Jones, a Labour MP who sits on the Commons Defence Select Committee and chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Shipbuilding, told the Mirror: “The Government’s schedule to replace a signicant number of Type  frigates by the mid-s looks increasingly unlikely.“As such, the Royal Navy is on track to have its lowest number of frontline warships on record, by the mid-s, chiefly owing to a frigate capability gap which is all the government’s own making.” Unions urged the Government to speed-up orders to protect workers. Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary Ian Waddell said: The national shipbuilding strategy clearly sets out a drumbeat of naval procurement which is designed to maintain our sovereign capability to design, manufacture and maintain our naval and auxiliary fleet.  We need to get on with delivering it in order to safeguard the safety of the nation and safeguard our world class shipbuilding capability and pump investment into our shipbuilding communities in every part of the UK which will be spent in local shops and businesses. The Prime Minister made much of a high wage high skilled economy in his speech last week but weaposve already got one in shipbuilding and we are at risk of losing it unless we get on with ordering and building these ships in British shipyards. GMB union national officer Ross Murdoch said: The Government’s dither and delay over the five-ship, Type  frigate contract could lead to our aircraft carriers being left with less frigate protection than they require. “Ministers must learn lessons from this and make sure there are no further hold ups to the FSS contracts. Instead of unclear and veiled comments about signicant proportions of the work for the UK, they should confirm the design, build and final assembly work will be carried out in our yards and will support our supply chain. This will provide the much-needed prosperity our UK shipyards and workforce need and help rebuild the UK economy.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Royal NavyMinistry of DefenceKevan JonesArmed forcesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

More families in England turned to schools for support due to pressures linked to the Covid crisis, according to research by UCLaposs Institute of Education. Schools serving populations with high levels of poverty shouldered a higher burden of dealing with food insecurity and inadequate housing. Researchers have warned that pupil premium funding, which is targeted at poorer children, does not cover the work schools do to support children living in poverty. One of the reportaposs authors Prof Alice Bradbury said: Schools are picking up the pieces from a welfare and social services system that no longer provides a real safety net for families.  For those schools, the impacts of poverty on childrenaposs lives are impossible to ignore. They interviewed  parents and staff across seven primary schools in England and found food insecurity was the most pressing priority for them all. Schools went to great s to ensure pupils received at least one meal a day - in some cases distributing food directly to the door. One headteacher said: What weaposve noticed over time was that the people who were coming to our food pantry, and we still run it now, werenapost the free school meal parents. It was this tier just above, the people whoaposd been furloughed, the people who had always had a job. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT school leadersapos union, said: Our members tell us that childrenaposs worries leave them unable to learn and enjoy school and in need of help in the form of food, clothing and basic supplies. They are often embarrassed and ashamed. Itaposs a situation that sticks in the throat of everyone who has young peopleaposs best interests at heart. Poverty and inequality will remain entrenched in the UK unless the Government takes urgent action. Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: Schools cannot act alone and urgent action to tackle the scourge of child poverty is needed from the Government.aposWe know that even before coronavirus, . million children and young people were growing up trapped in poverty and this is only going to be made worse as the pandemic continues to take its toll.Covid- has exposed the endemic levels of poverty and inequality in the UK. A Government spokeswoman said: Throughout the pandemic we ensured schools supported the most disadvantaged children by staying open to vulnerable pupils, and delivering free school meals to those learning remotely. We have also increased pupil premium funding, expanded the holiday activities and food programme, and extended breakfast clubs, in addition to our investment of more than £ billion to make up for time lost in the classroom. But we know families have struggled, which is why we have provided billions in welfare support for the most vulnerable, made the largest investment in affordable housing in a decade and expanded mental health services to thousands more children and young people, including through our Mental Health Recovery Action Plan.

Why  Because the ­Government is hostage to hard-line loyalists who hint at violencethe trade deal isn’t scrapped. This spat with the EU isn’t about sausages. It’s about deep-seated unionist anxiety that Ulster will eventually become part of a united Ireland. They fear the Northern Ireland protocol, which keeps the province in the EU single market, with the European Court of Justice overseeing disputes, will ­accelerate that process. That’s why signs appear on lampposts all over Ulster declaring: “NI Protocol Makes Belfast [Peace] Agreement Null and Void”. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  The implicit threat is ato violence. It was made explicit to MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee by representatives of the so-called Loyalist Communities Council, which speaks for banned ­paramilitary groups. I’ve seen what these men are capable of. The ­Government’s tacit pandering to them is as dangerous as it is deceitful. Brussels has made ­wide-ranging concession to the UK, with fewer checks on food, medicine and other goods crossing the Irish Sea. A compromise is possible, and never underestimate Boris Johnson’s readiness to rat on his friends, in this case Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, creepy new leader of the faltering DUP. But I suspect he doesn’t want a deal. He’d prefer a bust-up with Europe, allowing him to pose as the Churchillian saviour of a nation under siege from Johnny foreigner. That way lies madness – a trade war harming businesses, jobs and ­international relations. Does he care  One former Cabinet minister says: “Boris doesn’t give a stuff about Northern Ireland.” We will all be the losersour former European partners reciprocate that sentiment. Prescription for disaster After a decade of Tory misrule, le expectancy is falling in northern England. Men in parts of Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool won’t see their th birthday, while Kensington and Cha toffs live up to  years longer. Naturally, the Government chooses this time to propose prescription charges for  to -year-olds in England, exacerbating the adverse trend. This is Conservatives “levelling up” in action – making le worse for everybody, especially the disadvantaged in northern cities.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Health Department officials coyly admit that forcing millions to pay will lead to “a small negative impact on health inequalities” because four out of  prescriptions costing £. each will not be collected. And it “will affect some lower income groups more severely”. The Tories regard this as a price worth paying – by the sick and the poor – to rake in £million by . There is still time to halt this nasty trick. Write to your MP – especially the Tories – and demand another Government U-turn.

Speaking exclusively to the Mirror after visiting Outokumpu Stainless in Sheffield - the “Steel City” - Mr Starmer said: “The number one issue - both on the managerial side and the staff … is the massive problem with the cost of energy going through the roof and the potential impact that may have on the steel sector is absolutely number one in their minds. “Like us, they are astonished that the Government is standing complacently by. “The most activity we’ve had is a squabble about whether they are talking to the sector.”  Warring ministers have clashed over what support to give the industry, which employs , people directly and supports another , jobs in supply chains. Mills have paused production over recent weeks because of soaring power costs making plants too expensive to run. Touring the Outokumpu factory, the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw for themselves the “huge energy” used to melt steel at the recycling plant. Mr Starmer called on ministers to thrash out a “support package to make sure this energy crisis doesn’t translate into job losses on a permanent basis”.  He warned it would be unforgivablean energy price spike triggered long-term redundancies. We canapost allow that short-term problem to lead to job losses. That would be completely wrong, he said. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng submitted proposals to the Treasury earlier this week for a loan scheme to help energy-intensive industries like steel cope with the global spike in energy costs.  The move came after the Treasury previously denied there were any discussions with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on the issue. There has so far been no formal response from Chancellor Rishi Sunak, and industry leaders - who have yet to see details of the plan - fear it may amount to no more than a flimsy sticking plaster. With the COP climate change summit taking place in Glasgow next month, and growing clamour for the UK to slash carbon emissions, Mr Starmer rejected claims the sector is outdated and should be left to wane to boost Britain’s environmental image. “I completely don’t accept that,” he said. “In what future do people think we leave without steel   “Trains, cars, infrastructure, manufacturing, iPhones, construction - you name it.” Labour used last month’s party conference to announce a £billion plan for steel, outlining how it would help the sector switch to more environmentally-friendly production. Mr Starmer said: “The question is, ‘Have you got a Government bold enough to invest in the future production and recycling of steel in a way which is consistent with our climate obligations ’”  Unions “can’t imagine a future in Yorkshire or across the country without steel”, said the Labour leader. “What they are looking for is, ‘What is the immediate plan to get us through this energy price crisis, then what’s the longer term plan in terms of the future of steel ’,” he added.

Yet the Counting Dead Women survey shows since March when Sarah was killed, a further eighty women have been murdered. Rape convictions have fallen to a record low. There are an estimated .m female victims of domestic violence. Despite this, the Government puts the emphasis on women being more careful - offering them hotlines to ringthey want to go out at night or telling them to flag down a busthey feel in danger – rather than tackling those who commit the crimes directly. The Prime Minister admits more needs to be done. However, the landmark Policing Bill currently going through Parliament sets harsh new sentences for those who attack statues of women, but steadfastly refuses to do the same for those who commit crimes motivated by a violent hatred of them. Rather than wait for Boris Johnson, a cross-party group has come together in parliament to act. A group of peers and MPs led by the former Victims’ Commissioner Helen Newlove and I are fighting for laws which would give women and girls the same level of protection afforded to others who are victimised solely because of who they are – updating our national hate crime laws to include crimes motivated by hatred of women. This wouldn’t create any new crimes, but would mean those who are convicted of them face tougher sentences, just as those who commit racist, homophobic or ableist crimes do. It would also ensure all police forces record where crimes are motivated by misogyny. % of women report being harassed in public, yet % don’t report this with % saying doing so doesn’t change anything. Currently one in four forces record hate crimes targeting people because of their sex or gender. The evidence shows this makes a dference to the confidence of victims to come forward and gives police better information to help detect and so prevent crimes.  That’s why the National Police Chiefs Council has voted in favour of this policy being rolled out across the country - because itaposs good policing practice. And itaposs not just coppers who want this change. Experts ranging from major unions to womenaposs refuges, former police chiefs to the chair of the Justice Select Committee are supporting this campaign and calling for action now. The Lords will be debating these proposals in the coming weeks andthey back them it will be up to MPs to accept them. The only obstacle left is the Prime Minister who has spoken against it, but offers no alternative. The suffragettes taught us deeds not words matter. Ask your MP not to wait for Boris, but back our call to make misogyny a hate crime and put the law on the side of protecting women and girls.

She found furniture and appliances still in place, and a kitchen full of plates, glasses and utensils. There were even dirty dishes from eaten meals in the rooms. The living room was filled with old blankets, old vacuum cleaners and a Zenith TV.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Photos found in the house showed an older man sitting on the same sofa that is still in the living room, reading a newspaper. Other snaps, which the couple discovered in a suitcase, showed weddings and people holding a baby. Gaby also found a handwritten recipe for courgette bread - which she later tried out and said was delicious. While she pored over the items in the home, she couldnapost solve the mystery as to why it was abandoned so quickly. She said: Itaposs always hard to know why an abandoned home was left behind, or what led the family to leave so many belongings.  As for this home, I really donapost know for sure. But we can look at what is left and sometimes that can tell us at least a part of the story of the people who once resided there. In this case, there were so many photos of an older couple, and generally the décor and style of the home suggested that it was indeed an older couple that resided there. She said that, although she hoped it wasnapost the case, the couple could have passed away and left the home to someone who didnapost want to do anything with it.  Based on my observations of the home alone and the unkempt state of it, I imagine itaposs been more than a few years at least [since it was abandoned], she said. She shared clips filmed inside the home on her TikTok account, @urbex_muse, with her . million followers. The post was viewed nearly , times and racked up , likes, tugging on the heartstrings of many viewers. One person said: “I don’t know why but this made me super emotional.” “The feeling of homes like this is surreal. Time just stops, everything stops because they stopped,” said another viewer. Another person added: “As someone who does genealogy stuff, it breaks my heart seeing all of those memories left behind.” Gaby, who is a student, loves exploring abandoned houses and trying to piece together what happened there but she admits it can be very emotional. She said: It always feels a little sombre knowing that the home I am exploring was once bursting at the seams with memories, and that for some people still out there that home means the world to them. But it can also warm my soul so much when seeing evidence of a happy home rather than an unhappy one, whether that be reading old letters or postcards from the family members to seeing the photographs left behind to just feeling the energy of the home itself.Have you ever found an abandoned home  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcSometimes just even stepping into the space you can so clearly feel the sense of happiness and love left behind by the people that once stayed there.

Images have emerged from Asda stores across the country showing freezer aisles completely stripped of the festive meat. At one Asda branch in Birmingham, a solitary turkey crown could be seen in a freezer drawer completely stripped bare of products. Elsewhere in the store, a sign read: Sorry, temporarily out of stock. At a dferent branch in Kettering, Northamptonshire, Brits had stripped the turkeys from the frozen food section - and also cleared out all stuffing balls. It comes as Chancellor Rishi Sunak promises there will be a good amount of Christmas presents available this year, despite images of empty shelves pouring in from across the UK.  Earlier today, customers mocked a Cardf branch of Tesco Extra after pictures emerged of a massive sunflower oil display in the frozen food aisle. Another Co-Op branch was rumbled for cramming sauce bottles into refrigerators. Earlier this month, budget supermarket Aldi reported soaring sales of their frozen turkeys and Christmas puddings. Food experts have warned shoppers to buy their Christmas grub soon and store it in the freezer so they donapost miss out. Families scrambling to find a bird and spuds has led to Aldiaposs turkey crown sales soaring up to , per day. Sales of Christmas puddings are also up by  per cent.  Some families may be hoarding up to £, worth of festive chow, according to reports. Sales of turkeys have also shot up at Iceland - who reported a  per cent increase since the same time last year. The prospect of a thin Christmas has been blamed on supply chain issues, caused by the ersion of vessels from a loading port facility in Felixstowe, Suffolk. The rogue items and empty shelves appear as shipping giant erting vessels from their facility in Felixstowe, Suffolk. Danish shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk warns the problem may continue into the new year.  A aposperfect stormapos is said to have been created by a lack of lorry drivers, a spike in imports, and Covid restrictions. Lars Mikael Jensen, head of the east-west network at Maersk, said containers are stacking up at the Suffolk port because there arenapost enough lorry drivers to aposget boxes outapos.The port is the off-loading point for most imported toys, raising fears of kids waking up to empty stocking on Christmas day, The Times reports. And today Tory Chancellor Rishi Sunak confessed the government canapost fix every single problem when discussing the issue. Mr Sunak said the Government would do absolutely everything we can to solve the British port issues. Global factors are being blamed for logistical issues, with nationwide delays at ports. At Felixstowe, ships have also been caught in sea traffic. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC, Mr Sunak sought to reassure Britons as people begin to think about shopping for Christmas.  He said: Weaposre doing absolutely everything we can to mitigate some of these challenges. They are global in nature so we canapost fix every single problem but I feel confident there will be good provision of goods for everybody. Iaposm confident there will be a good amount of Christmas presents available for everyone to buy. Mr Sunak chaired a meeting of finance ministers on Wednesday as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank convene in the US capital.  The Treasury said Mr Sunak told the meeting of the importance of global co-operation to ensure that supply chains are more resilient as the world emerges from the pandemic. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Sunak said: Supply chain issues are being felt globally - and finance leaders from around the globe must collaborate to address our shared challenges. Today we have collectively agreed to work closely over the coming months - and together we will build a strong and resilient recovery. The Mirror has contacted Asda for comment.

His comments came after Cabinet colleague Stephen Barclay repeatedly refused to apologise for Government failings during the crisis. Mr Javid said of course he is sorry for the suffering people have endured as a result of the pandemic. But he said he is not in a position yet to say exactly what decisions could have been improved. Asked on BBC Breakfasthe is sorry for the failures that occurred, the Health Secretary said: Yes, of course Iaposm sorry. Obviously I am new in the role, but on behalf of the Government I am sorry for, during the pandemic, anyone that suffered, especially anyone that lost a loved one, a mother, a dad, a brother, a sister, a friend. Of course I am sorry for that.  Also, all those people that may not have lost someone but they are still suffering - there are many people sadly suffering from long Covid, we still donapost know the impact of that. Of course I am. There will be lessons to learn from this pandemic for this Government, for governments across the world, there will be lessons. It is important that is done. There is going to be a public inquiry and I think that is the best place to learn these lessons.

David Brownlees, , also thought his stomach pains last January were down to overindulging at Christmas.However, he was floored when he was told he had kidney cancer after not experiencing any of the symptoms associated with the disease, the Daily Record reports. He has since had his kidney removed and has undergone immunotherapy as the cancer had spread to his lung, which has ravaged his body and left him unable toto work. David now has a massive scar where his kidney was removed, which his family have dubbed his shark bite.  This week, David welcomed a new type of procedure for kidney cancer, which is a more targeted approach that blocks the growth of blood vessels in cancer tumours while harnessing the body’s immune system to help find and fight cancer. David, who lives with his we Leanne and children Amy, , Logan, , Jack, , and Lena, , said: “At  years old, I never thought I’d be sitting here with one kidney. “I’ll never be considered cured. I’m at high risk of it coming back again. “I worked nightsht and so any kind of symptoms I would get, like being tired, having no energy during the daytime or sleeping more I put down to that.  “It was post-Christmas , I thought I had overindulged and went to see the doctor and he arranged for me to have an ultrasound because he thought I maybe had gallbladder stones and when I went for the ultrasound they scanned down the left side of my body and she just went quiet and said can you come back for a CT scan  “Two days later I had a CT scan and it was then they told me it was cancer.” David said he was diagnosed on January  last year and had his kidney removed on March . for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Scotland recorded its first Covid- case while he underwent his operation. The following week, surgeries started to get cancelled and by March  the country plunged into lockdown - meaning all David’s aftercare appointments were done by telephone. He continued: “Maggie’s and Macmillan were fantastic in giving me support but it was never face-to-face. “It was hard for myself, but it was hard for the family as well.” His side effects were also similar to Covid symptoms and every time he was taken to the hospital he was treated as Covid patient and had to wait for test results before starting treatment. David said the isolation he experienced while in the hospital because of Covid restrictions was also hard to deal with. He also said the immunotherapy he received left him experiencing “every side effect in the book”.It also caused severe inflammation in his body, which has left lasting damage to his lungs, pituitary and adrenal systems and arthritis. Even though David was “always prepared for the worst, he spoke of the relief he felt when he feared the disease had spread to his brain after getting bad headaches, but it was in fact caused by inflammation due to his treatment.David said he welcomes this week’s news that the Scottish Medicines Consortium has recommended cabozantinib for use by the NHS across Scotland, in combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of advanced kidney cancer in adults. He continued: “Everybody knows about breast cancer and prostate cancer gets a lot of coverage but I truly believe that the cancer that is growing fastest out there and I’m always hearing about is kidney cancer. “If you have any symptoms at all, or anything out of the ordinary then just talk to your GP or anybody about it. “People just dismiss the tiredness or the aches and pains, or ‘it’s just a urinary infection’. “Butthis keeps happening you really need to see someone about it.” Robert Jones, Professor of Clinical Cancer Research, University of Glasgow, said: This news is a clear demonstration of Scotland being at the forefront of cancer care, with local patients the first to benefit from this treatment approach. With incidence of RCC rising in Scotland over the last decade, this recommendation will mark an important milestone for patients with advanced disease. The combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab combines agents which both block the growth of blood vessels in cancer tumours and those which harness the body’s immune system to help find and fight cancer.

Dashcam footage was caught by Plymouth man Cody Hugill, who was driving towards the junction of Underwood Road in Plympton on Wednesday evening. The video shows Cody driving up to the road and stopping as he sees the man walking the German Shepherd type breed, whilst behind the wheel.  In the footage, a man can be seen driving his car whilst holding the lead of his dog out of the window and going at a slow speed uphill for the animal to keep up. The car carries on driving up the road and out of sight, with pedestrians and drivers in a state of confusion. Shocked Cody told PlymouthLive: It was a light night, and I had to do a bit of a double takeIaposm honest. I was just travelling down the road and watching them, and even a couple of passersby turned their heads. Then as he drove up the road I wasnapost able to follow him completely, but heaposd gone on for a while at least. It is not the only strange antics recently by pet owners that have left onlookers speechless, with an owl seen being taken for a walk in Glasgow. A man was spotted casually strolling down a road holding an owl in footage that has gone viral with the bizarre video being likened to the Harry Potter films. Footage showed the man walking in Paisley, Glasgow, with the owl perched on his hand and looking quite relaxed.A video of the unusual outing was posted on Twitter by Kirsty Mitchell, , who saw the the pair from her car, reported the Daily Record.The Twitter clip showed the man with the fine-looking owl heading down Glasgow Road.Last month, the same man was spotted on a train from London to Edinburgh, leaving fellow passengers baffled as the bird perched on his shoulder.Comment MORE ON Devon and Cornwall PoliceDepartment for TransportDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She was desperate tohome to the Philippines to visit her sick mother, but her employer had taken her passport and not paid her in weeks. She was working day and night as a domestic worker and surviving on the children’s leftovers. Her employer relentlessly verbally abused her. “I had no time off, it wasn’t allowed,” she says. “I just had to work  hours a day. Sometimes I would sleep only two to three hours. I’m not allowed to use my mobile, they shout at meI try to talk to anyone. They told me not to say I am tired.” The family were visiting England for Christmas from their home in Dubai when Justina asked her employer’s mother-in-law for a scrap of food. “I was just so hungry,” she says. “The mother of the Mister said ‘she must have some food’. My employer went mad, she grabbed me by the neck. She said, ‘how dare you ask my mother-in-law for food!’ “I said ‘sorry madame, because I am hungry madame’.” “She said ‘shame on you, you f***ing’, all the bad words. She shouted at me from pm until  in the morning. I think I have to escape, or I will die here.”Have you been a victim of modern slavery  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story Justina managed to escape her employer and was eventually granted legal status in the UK under Modern Slavery laws. The Modern Slavery Act is one of the Conservative government’s cornerstone immigration reforms – and is often used as cover for the Tories’ anti-migrant policies. But now even these protections are under threat, under Priti Patel’s Nationality and Borders Bill. Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner Dame Sara Thornton is among those who have warned the plans “will make the identication of victims of Modern Slavery harder and will create additional vulnerabilities”. Perversely for a Bill which the Home Secretary claims is all about ending the misery of trafficking, Thornton adds that the reforms “could signicantly undermine our ability to bring traffickers to justice”. Meanwhile, Caroline Haughey QC, who helped draft the legislation, says “sadly the bill undermines all the efforts, and I do think achievements, made with the Modern Slavery Act.” Justina had taken the job in Dubai as a domestic to help her elderly parents in the Philippines, retired farm-workers who needed medical care. Speaking ahead of Anti-Slavery Day on Monday, she tells me she planned to send money home for an operation for her mum’s eye cancer – but her employers regularly failed to pay her. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletterThe abuse that Justina faced led her to the brink of a breakdown, and she becomes distressed as she speaks. “I cannot breathe,” she says. “I am so scared. I am worried I am going crazy.” In London, she spent hours sitting outside restaurants in the cold waiting for her rich employers to finish eating inside. “But how can I escape, I have no friends in the UK  Then, I think ‘God will guide me’.” Justina escaped the night her employer tried to strangle her. “I didn’t sleep all night,” she says. “At am, I walked out in only my clothes. I am crying and crying. I am alone, it is Christmas and very cold. I am walking until the sun comes up. I don’t have any money because they haven’t paid me even though I begged them, ‘please my parents aren’t well and they need the money for medicines’.”  Justina was eventually taken in by a kind passer-by who took her to hospital. “I was shaking all the time. I think someone will kill me,” she says. “I am crying day and night and I have stopped eating. In the hospital they gave me medicine to calm down.” The hospital encouraged her to contact the police and the anti-trafficking charity Kalayaan. Its name means ‘Freedom’ in Filipino. The police told her that her employer had put out a Missing Persons report for her but that she did not need toto them. With Kalayaan’s help, Justina eventually won a long battle for Leave To Remain in the UK, using a framework called the National Referral Mechanism . Campaigners say the Borders Bill will adversely affect cases like Justina’s in a number of ways, but the most dangerous is that it reduces the amount of time a survivor has to come forward. In Justina’s case this took a long time, and she remains clearly terried. Kalayaan says this shorter timeframe just isn’t realistic, and that the Home Office will be allowed to turn away survivors before they even get to the NRM. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK is a world leader in identying and supporting genuine victims of modern slavery, and this will continue. However, over recent years we have seen an increase in the number of illegal migrants and foreign criminals seeking modern slavery referrals – enabling them to frustrate their removal from our country. “The changes we are making through the Bill seek to ensure we can identy genuine victims as early as possible and ensure they receive appropriate support, while reducing any opportunities for the system to be misused.” Justina fights on for other victims. “Kalayaan helped me fight to be allowed to stay safely in the UK,” she says. “I can breathe again. Even so, I am always dreaming of being trapped. Now more people will be trapped in that situation. It’s not good for human rights. They should be ashamed. It’s not fair.” The Nationality and Borders Bill, due to become law next spring, is the most aggressive piece of anti-refugee legislation since Britain signed the Geneva Convention in . On Wednesday [th Oct], refugees and supporters will gather to oppose it in Parliament Square. Meanwhile, as the Bill makes its way through Parliament, Anti-Slavery Day on Monday will take on a new, modern, urgency.Kalayaan - www.kalayaan.org.uk Refugees Welcome Rally - .-.pm on Wednesday, October , in Parliament Square, London.

Mistakes at Amyaposs Fish and Chips in Darfield, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire resulted in ideal conditions for food positioning bacteria to grow, inspectors said.Cooked food was left outside to cool down and ingredients were even stored on the floor of the takeaway, YorkshireLive reports.The shop kept a tray of ribs cooling in a warm oven and left raw fish in a washing up bowl in a fridge which was warmer than it should have been. Despite the countless errors, employees were unfazed by the horric conditions and showed little understanding of the risk this may pose. The business said that while it agreed with the remarks from Barnsley politan Borough Council, a number of improvements have been made since the inspection on July . However, the chip shop has been slapped with a zero-star food hygiene rating by the Food Standards Agency- the lowest possible grade. Officials carried out a full food hygiene rating at the chip shop in School Street, Darfield, and filed a troubling report. Among the most concerning findings were the shocking conditions in which food was kept. Food was being stored on the floor of the main cooking area and was at risk of bacterial contamination, said the inspector. The picture above shows bowls of food lying on the floor as a member of staff works nearby. Food was also found being prepared and stored outside, posing further risks to customers, while cooked rice was left out to cool at room temperature. Once food was cooked, it was sometimes left in the danger zone. The inspector spotted a tray of ribs cooling in a warm oven on their visit, which presented the ideal conditions for food positioning bacteria. There was a general lack of cleaning... and hand washing from staff, storage containers were damaged and dirty and there were not even enough cleaning supplies in the building. One area of particular concern was the risk of cross-contamination.  Raw meat was being prepared next to cooked food which was about to be served. The conditions didnapost appear to improve in the fridges either. Here, raw meat and prepared food were stored on the same shelves. The temperature of the fridge - where raw fish was kept in a washing up bowl - was .°C, almost °C warmer than FSA recommendations. Raw meat was also stored unwrapped in freezers, while the lid to one of the chest freezers at the chip shop did not close properly. You must not prepare food for customers who declare they have a food allergy as you are unable to safely prepare food for them to eliminate risk from... cross-contamination, said the inspector. One of the most startling pictures is of the chopping boards at Amyaposs Fish and Chips. These were used by staff for prepared food, but the images show how they are covered in black grime.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Chopping boards used for the preparation of ready to eat food items were found to be in a filthy condition, said the report. Remarkably, staff told inspectors this was acceptable and showed little understanding of the risk this may pose. The problems didnapost end there though. The thermometer probe was dirty, but it appears as though the staff didnapost use it anyway. Instead, they simply copied temperature records from previous entries, rather than actually checking the food.  The report added that most of the issues highlighted in the  inspection were also found during previous visits and little progress had been made. The hygiene and safety standards noted on this inspection fall well below those expected, it concluded. Since the inspection, Amyaposs Fish and Chips have filed a brief update to FSA. They claim the premises have been thoroughly cleaned and procedures are now in place to ensure that cleanliness is maintained. The owner has also stated that staff have been trained   re-trained and are under better supervision and a new Food Safety Management system has been introduced.

But there is one royal milestone the three-year-old has yet to hit - even though his younger cousin Archie already has, and itaposs partly down to the Covid pandemic. Louis has yet to go on a royal tour, which is mainly due to the travel restrictions that have been in place since early .Meanwhile, Archie joined his parents Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for their trip to South Africa in . We only got to see him a few times, and the highlight of the busy visit was when he went to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu.His older siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte were both considerably younger than Louis on their first overseas tour.George went on his first royal tour when he was just nine months old, visiting Australia and New Zealand with his proud parents.

In the interview, the duke shared his worries about his childrenaposs generation who might still be talking about climate change in  years, when it will be too late. He was also askedhis oldest son Prince George, had started asking questions about what his impact on the planet is. And he revealed Louisapos love of the outdoors, as well as Georgeaposs concerns for the future when it comes to climate change. William said: I think he [George] has a definite sense of realisation and understanding so education is really key. So, for instance, knowing not to overuse water, being careful with our resources, turning off light switches, things like that, which was instilled in me growing up. So yes, he is acutely aware, more so than the other two at the moment. Charlotte is just a bit young, sheaposs still not quite sure and actually Louis just enjoys playing outside the whole time - he lives outside. But I think it is slowly dawning on them that these things matter but when you are that young, you just want to have fun and enjoy it.

Barry Domaille, , said he called Rosebank Health Surgery in Gloucester as he needed an inhaler in the last week of September. The man, who was recently diagnosed with emphysema - a condition that causes shortness of breath - claimed the receptionist refused to arrange a consultation with a doctor.Mr Domaille, who is also caring for his we, was allegedly told to either call  or go to AE, Gloucestershire Live reports.Bosses at the surgery have now urged the pensioner to get in touch to discuss his experience. Mr Domaille said: “Basically I have a health problem where I struggle breathing. I have been recently diagnosed with emphysema. “I was diagnosed at hospital but as yet nothing has been prescribed. I rang the doctor in hope to get an inhaler prescribed to help me. “I rang the Rosebank surgery and told them my symptoms. The receptionist told me they can not deal with it as they are a primary care so to ring  or . I just needed medicine so I could breathe.” Mr Domailleaposs daughter told him to call the surgery again without describing his symptoms, but asking to speak to the doctor. However, the man claimed that when he called back, the receptionist told him she needed to write something in the system to get the GP to call the patient. Mr Domaille said that  minutes later, the GP called to discuss his weaposs condition and towards the end of their conversation, he mentioned his health issues too. He said: “I explained the situation with my breathing and there and then a prescription was written and being sent to the surgery. “Then I had an email through from the reception saying I had to tell the receptionist what is the matter with me to satisfy her a doctoraposs call would be needed.” Following the phone conversation, the GP issued him with an inhaler, Mr Domaille claimed. He said: “I know everyone makes mistakes but it seemed the receptionist did not want to know at all. Something has got to be done. It is a crazy situation. “We are  years old. We are not looking for sympathy but something has got to be done. “The way things are right now, it is far worse than anything I have ever know. The whole system is at fault.” Rosebank Health Practice Manager Partner Susie Graham has urged Mr Domaille to get in touch to discuss his concerns.  A spokesperson from NHS Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group said: “We are very sorry to hear that this patient is unhappy with the service he received. We would urge him to contact the practice so that they can look into the matter fully. “Most patients who contact their surgery, either online or by phone, are assessed by a suitably trained member of the practice team to decide whether they need to be seen in person, via a phone or video consultation orthey would benefit from a visit to a community pharmacy. “We have been working very closely with our GP surgeries throughout the COVID- pandemic to ensure that appropriate arrangements and safeguards are in place to see patients face to facetheir medical need requires it. “If the matter cannot be resolved with the practice, the Patient Advice and Liaison Servicecan look into this and liaise with the practice.

Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Munira Wilson MP said: These figures reveal a postcode lottery of care that is leaving people struggling to get GP appointments or waiting weeks to be seen.

I was always getting in trouble, says the -year-old who now lives in Wiltshire.  I always got the cane or was bunking off. I caused my mother no end of bother, but going to McDonaldaposs was an unbelievable transition. Patrick went school at St Austinaposs Roman Catholic School in Charlton. But school just didnapost suit him and without the authority figure of a father around, his le was beginning to go down the wrong path. It was devastating losing my father and it happened right before Christmas, so in many ways Christmas was tinged with sadness after that until I started celebrating it with my own kids, he says.

It was very busy even back then, he says. Youaposd be making up and packing, filing up the drinks machines, there was always a multitude of things to do. The harder you worked, the more popular you were. You only had to be there a couple of months and you felt quite entrenched and you could show your skills to the new trainees.  Iaposve got nothing but fond memories of it. They were good times. Customers were far less abusive back then than they are now. These days youaposve got people coming in [drunk] after food, but we shut at pm back then so we didnapost have that. And Patrick was able to use his hard-earned money to buy clothes and shoes as well as supporting his mum and the family. I used to earn £ a fortnight and a pint of lager back then was p, so I felt like a millionaire, like I was a Rothschild. I would spend the money on clothes. My Doc Marten boots and Levi jeans.

Samantha Blackborow, , was cycling when a bin lorry driving through heavy traffic turned left and mowed her down in November last year.The mum-of-two was fun over by the front wheel and died instantly from severe multiple injuries, despite desperate attempts to save her le, pathologist Professor Ian Roberts said. Company director David Lane had been waiting at a Costa drive-thru with his car window open when he heard the specialist nurse scream and watched in horror as she was knocked off her bike in what looked like slow motion.  Mr Lane told Oxford Coroneraposs Court: I heard the screams and saw a cyclist and her bike. She had been knocked off the cycle by the bin lorry which was still moving. I saw a childaposs seat on the back of the bike. I saw the front-wheel drive over the cyclist, the lorry went straight over the cyclist before it came to a stop. The white Mercedes lorry was only travelling at five miles an hour, but Samantha, from Oxford, suffered unsurvivable injuries and she was declared deceased on the side of the road. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Lorry driver Robin Dowsett told the inquest he had  years of experience as a professional and was working as a cover driver for the waste management company Veolia. Taking to the witness stand, Mr Dowsett said: I was waiting patiently to turn left...there is a blind spot by the kerbside mirror.....I was constantly checking my mirrors, I did not see her. I knew I had hit something as I felt a jolt....afterwards I was in complete and utter shock. He explained he had just ed from a -minute break where he cleaned his prescription glasses, telephoned his we and played his games before setting off again, shortly before the tragedy. Investigators had previously made the decision not to prosecute the driver following the tragedy. Chris Lewis, a forensic collision investigator, said: Ultimately this collision comes down to whether the driver perceived her in her bright coloured jacket against the road surface and whether she appeared in the mirrors while he was looking at them. He continued: Samantha would have been visible in at least one of the mirrors, however, she was passing just as he was preparing to turn left, giving an audio and visible warning of his intended manoeuvre. He added there was a possibility that the sunaposs glare could have restricted the visibility of the pedal cyclist. Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said: Samantha Blackborow was a specialist nurse. Her death was veried at .am on November  , Her cause of death was multiple injuries. Samantha was riding her bike when a lorry travelling slowly in the same direction in heavy traffic turned left and impacted with her on the front nearside, resulting in her falling off and being run over. He recorded the conclusion of road traffic collision. A canvas of the mother, her partner Will and her two children sitting on the sofa was placed at the front of the inquest room. A tribute online said: It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Samantha. Samantha sadly passed away on November   at the age of  years.

The Duke went on to discuss his worries about his son’s generation who might still be talking about climate change in  years’ time, when it will be too late As part of a new BBC podcast, William said: So George at school recently has been doing litter picking and I didnapost realise but talking to him the other day he was already showing that he was getting a bit confused and a bit sort of annoyed by the fact they went out litter picking one day and then the very next day they did the same route, same time and pretty much all the same litter they picked up back again. And I think that for him he was trying to understand how and where it all came from. He couldnapost understand, heaposs like, aposwell, we cleaned this. Why has it not gone away ’ The future king told the podcast that he was concerned that George and his generation might still be talking about climate change in decades to come.  He added: But it shouldnapost be that thereaposs a third generation now coming along having to ramp it up even more. And you know, for me, it would be an absolute disasterGeorge is sat here talking to you or your successor, you know in like  years’ time, whatever, still saying the same thing, because by then we will be too late.William also slammed billionaire space tourists such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk for pursuing space travel instead of helping to solve the climate crisis.In an impassioned plea to two of the world’s richest men, both worth around £billion each, the Duke of Cambridge said: “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live.” A new age space race between Amazon founder Bezos’s Blue Origin and Tesla founder Musk has emerged pitting two of the world’s richest and brainiest men against each other. In contrast, father-of-three William has said he is being motivated with his environmental work to “use my little bit of influence” to help change the world for future generations. “I want the things that I’ve enjoyed – the outdoor le, nature, the environment – I want that to be there for my children, and not just my children but everyone ’s children. “If we’re not careful we’re robbing from our children’s future through what we do now. And I think that’s not fair. I want to use my little bit of influence   profile to highlight incredible people doing incredible things and will genuinely help fix some of these problems.” His comments, which will be broadcast today in an interview on the BBC Newscast podcast, come as Hollywood actor William Shatner yesterday became the oldest person to go to space.The -year-old, who played Captain James T Kirk in the Star Trek films and TV series, took off from the Texas desert with three other iniduals in a mission paid for by Bezos. Mr Shatneraposs trip on the rocket lasted about  minutes, while in July Bezos made his own  minute flight into space in his self funded rocket New Shepard saying it was his “best day ever!

Her Majesty was visiting the Welsh Parliament in Cardf with her son Charles, the Prince of Wales, and his we Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. She wore a pink coat and hat combination and was not sporting a mask as she shook hands with dignitaries. Clasped in her hand was a walking stick she was last seen holding two days ago at a service to mark the th anniversary of the Royal British Legion. Before that the Queen, , was last spotted in public using the same walking aid back in January , when she relied on it to assist her walking following a knee operation. On Tuesday Her Majesty was handed the stick after stepping from her state limousine, and appeared to be moving freely as she walked to her seat for the start of the service. She used the stick again as she left. A jam-packed schedule was put on for the Queen, Charles and Camilla at the Parliament building, which is called Senedd Cymru in Welsh.  The Welsh and British national anthems were played to welcome the royals before a royal salute was given. The Royal Navy with the band of the Royal Marines was in position in front of the Senedd. Also greeting the trio were school children waving Welsh flags. The royals were due to meet party leaders and listen to a musical performance given by the Welsh National Youth Opera. The Queen, Charles and Camilla were there for the opening ceremony of the sixth session of the Senedd. Back in  the head of state was seen using a walking stick as she left King Edward VII Hospital in London.  Back then she opted for a heavy duty pole following the operation, before wielding a wooden support two weeks later at Sandringham. Paul Simons, the owner of London-based business WalkingSticks, told Mail Online that the Queen was using a more of a telescopic walking pole with trigger grip and wrist loop this week. He added: It has an unusual grip but appears to be a comfortable companion and the Queenaposs go-to walking stick for occasions such as this.

Emma Buchan started using salons when she was just  and would visit her local shop around five times a week. The -year-old from Edinburgh, Scotland, says she never used sun cream - and almost paid the ultimate price. She says husband Craig Buchan noticed a lumpy mole on her thigh when she was around  but even then she carried on with he regular visits. He aposconstantly naggedapos her to get it checked out but she was in apostotal denialapos - but he refused to stop demanding she must see the doctors. The mum-of-one said Craig booked her an appointment in February  and despite the doctor saying it looked apossuspiciousapos she still believed it was aposnothingapos and went on the beds immediately after. But the HR manager was in apostotal shockapos when she was eventually diagnosed with Stage A melanoma. She was left racked with aposguiltapos at how aposselfishapos she had been pursuing a tan as she was apospetriedapos that sheaposd leave daughter India-Rose Buchan, nine, motherless. Emma said: My husband saved my le. Even right nowit wasnapost for him, I still wouldnapost have made an appointment. I think I would have just been in total denial. He first spotted it at night when we were in bed. We were probably just watching Netflix.He always complained that I needed to get it checked because he thought that it was growing and getting quite lumpy but obviously I didnapost think anything of it. It was a good few years that he would constantly nag and I think thataposs why he just made the appointment himself because he knew that I would never do it. Emma used to book beach holidays to Spain and Greece to get a tan and used oil more than sun cream, which would be the lowest factor. Emma said: I started using sunbeds at a time when a tan became the fashion and everybody  was doing it and said that having a tan made you look better basically. When I became a teenager the goal was to get a tan on holiday. I used to be that person out of all my friends that tanned quite easily. Even with my friends weaposd have competitions to see who could get the brownest on girlsapos holidays. Itaposs madness now when you think back of all the danger you put yourself in. I was  per cent a tan addict. It was very clear that I was. Even though the doctor had said that it looked suspicious, I still went back on it [sunbed]. So it was clear that I was addicted to them.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Emma said that when she first noticed the mole it was just the average freckle size and smaller than a p piece. However, itaposs appearance changed and it became lumpy and by the time she went to the doctors just before her th birthday it was aposhugeapos and oddly shaped around the size of a p coin. Emma said: When they told us it was cancer and my mum and husband were in complete shock. I donapost think anybody expected it to be that diagnosis. The penny only dropped when the doctor said aposyouaposve got melanomaapos, right to that second. At the time I was just petried for my daughter. I donapost actually remember the conversation. All I heard was the word aposcancerapos and then I just thought aposmy daughter. Sheaposs not going to have a mum. What have I done apos The guilt and how selfish I felt for using tanning beds and sunbathing with no protection and things. I was just in total shock. She made a vow to leave sunbeds behind, saying: Iaposll never use them again,. Itaposs not worth it. Thereaposs comments on my post where people are like aposwell, Iaposll die with a good tanapos and itaposs that mentality of thinking that it wonapost happen to you.

Social media is seeing users increasingly talking about having caught a “Super Cold” as Covid- tests come back negative. Prof Neil Mabbott, expert at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This highlights the power of the lockdown, mask wearing, social distancing and sanitation measures introduced in response to the pandemic.“Not only was this very effective in reducing transmission of the coronavirus within the community, but at the same time it had the additional benefit of reducing the spread of colds and other common transmissible diseases.“As these measures are eased and people start mixing more indoors and travelling on public transport we can expect to see a signicant rise in colds and other respiratory diseases.”  Retail worker Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth, caught what she calls “the worst cold ever” at a festival.A normal cold for her would have “a runny nose, sneezing, a bit of a sore throat and feeling a bit rundown”.“Nothing like this,” she told the BBC. “I barely slept, I’d wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired,” she adds. Rebecca did lateral flow tests and got negative results, but has been ill for more than a week, and was left wondering “ it’s ever going to end”.  Prof Alex Richter, of Birmingham University, said: “It is impossible to tell the dference between a cold and Covid- clinically. “They present so similarly that only PCR testing can dferentiate between the two. Lateral flow testing can help with screening, butsomeone has symptoms then they should go for a PCR swab test.” “It is unlikely we are seeing the circulation of a aposSuper Coldapos,” Prof Mabbott added. “Rather our immune systems have had limited exposure to colds over the past  months, so our immunity to these diseases will have waned during this period and will be less effective against colds than would be expected normally.” Prof Alan McNally, is Professor of Microbial Evolutionary Genomics at the University of Birmingham and was Infectious Disease lead at the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab. He said: “If you have any symptoms of respiratory infection you should stay at home to prevent transmission and get a test done for Covid- to rule in or out. Trying to self-diagnose is a sure fire way to send Covid- case rates soaring again.” Comment MORE ON EducationHospitalsHeart diseasePublic transportCoronavirusNHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Customers have been snapping the odd product choices in supermarkets like Tesco, Co-op and Asda across the country.It comes as Brits are warned of a light Christmas ahead after the UKaposs biggest container port reached capacity and was forced to turn ships away. Products are now being delayed and not making it into stores, according to reports. The shortages have been noticed by Brits up and down the country, who have been taking photographs of the rogue choices. One shared an image of fresh food crates at a Co-Op in Hertfordshire loaded with Quality Street, Celebrations and Dairy Milk instead of vegetables. Meanwhile, an Asda in Gloucester stretched out a display of Lynx deodorant to cover most of its toiletry aisle.  A Tesco Extra in Cardf was mocked after a massive sunflower oil display was spotted in the frozen food aisle. Staff at another Co-Op branch stuck rows of squeezey bottles of Heinz Salad Cream and HP sauce in refrigerators. The rogue items have been appearing in stores as shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk is erting vessels from their facility in Felixstowe, Suffolk. The Danish company warned the problem will continue into the new year. The issue has reportedly been caused by a lack of lorry drivers, a spike in imports and Covid restrictions at ports combining in a aposperfect stormapos.  Lars Mikael Jensen, head of the east-west network at Maersk, said containers are stacking up in Felixstowe because there are not enough drivers to aposget boxes outapos.Most imported toys come through the port, raising fears there will be shortages over Christmas, The Times reports. And today Tory Chancellor Rishi Sunak did little to reassure customers when discussing shortages - confessing that the government canapost fix every single problem.As fears grow of kids waking up on Christmas Day to empty stockings, the Chancellor said the Government were do absolutely everything we can to solve the British port issues.  Diverted ships are being unloaded at ports where, including Rotterdam, Antwerp and Bremerhaven, and are then transferred to smaller vessels to be transported to the UK. The process is reportedly causing delays of up to a week. Mr Jensen previously told : There is a shortage of truckers in the UK. Normally after four to five days the containers are out of the terminal and into a warehouse in Birmingham or wherever before coming back empty. “The trouble is that now we don’t have the same speed of flow of boxes moving in and out. With fewer truckers on average it takes longer to get boxes out of the terminal, so they are left standing. He also told The Times: We had to stop operations on a ship because there was nowhere to discharge the containers. Felixstowe is among the three worst affected ports in the world, Mr Jensen said. One shipping boss told The Times: I donapost want to sound like a Grinch but there are going to be gaps on shelves this Christmas. Mike Bowden, procurement manager at the shipping group Cory Brothers, added the port is so full of containers that new ones cannot be unloaded - and empty ones cannot be put back on ships. The Department of Transport told The Times that the issue was not aposunique to the UKapos, adding that ports around the world are battling container capacity and supply chain issues.

Izaac Rose claims he was on the verge of throwing up after realising the Plant Based Double Whopper he thought heaposd ordered from Burger King was in fact beef. The -year-old, who has never eaten meat in his entire le, was alerted to the sneaky pattyaposs true form when his sister Jamila, , asked him for a bite. The vegan woman reflexively spat it out, realising she had a mouthful of piping hot cow. Izaac, Jamila and her veggie boyfriend Tawand Mushambi, who luckily hadnapost started tucking into his meat Whopper yet, headed back to the store in Lady Bay, Nottingham to raise the issue.  They received a mixed response, Jamila said, with the cashier responsible apologising for the mistake while the manager seemed to find the whole situation funny. My brother says he feels so bad, betrayed and disgusted, Jamila told The Mirror. He also felt like he was going to throw up. We trusted it would be the right thing.  Our parents brought us up vegetarian and we have never eaten meat before. I think aposthank god I didnapostapos. I had a bit of it and as soon as I chewed it I spat it out on the table. The texture in my mouth. It was almost like I had an ejector button. The trio had gone into the Nottingham shop on August  and ordered three Vegan Royales and two Plant Based Whoppers, which were recently added to the Burger King menu. By the time they realised the burgers were in fact meat, Izaac had polished off three quarters of it. After noting the packaging of the burger was red and not green - denoting meat contents instead of veggie ones - Jamila checked the receipt and discovered the wrong items had been put through the till. She was less than impressed with the reaction that met them at the store. The manager seemed to find it amusing, he couldnapost give a tiddlers, the accountant said.  He was smirking asking what he was supposed to do about it. I asked him to get the manager and he said aposI am the managerapos. I feel like he found the whole situation funny. In the UK veganism is a protected characteristic, on a similar level to other moral frameworks such as religion.According to Go Vegan World, the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission has long recognised veganism as a protected philosophical belief or conviction under the Equality Actaposs guidance materials.This was reiterated in court last January when an employment tribunal ruled in favour of Jordi Casamitjanaaposs after he raised concerns that the League Against Cruel Sportsapos pension fund was being invested with firms that tested on animals and hurt the environment. While Jamila does not plan on taking any legal action, she hopes that Burger King will make changes to avoid similar incidents in the future. I would like BK to ensure it doesnapost happen again, she said. If it was that easy, how many people has that happened to  They have made someone eat a dead carcass who has never done that before.

Hilarious photos show her dancing on a country lane as flames roar from the dress. Another shows her stamping out the fire- leaving the flashy gown in a pile of smouldering ash. Chrissy - who works as a nutritionist - hatched her plan after seeing other women doing the same on social media. She said destroying the country-themed gown gave her closure after a tough orce. Her and her former husband were together for seven years. They were married for three before going separate ways in September . Chrissy claims her ex-hubby cheated on her six times and the couple tried marriage counselling. Chrissy said: I saw a orce photo shoot and I just couldnapost believe it, I had to do it. I thought it would give me closure and be a big f*** you. It looked so much fun. What  was I going to do with a wedding dress  I donapost believe in selling them once theyaposve been worn, my daughter wasnapost going to want it. Even though it was a , dress, it was going to give me the closure I needed. It was so satisfying, we absolutely destroyed that thing. We ripped it, got it in the water and burned it. My daughter came with me so it was a really fun day out and she loved it. Chrissy claims that in March , four months into their relationship, she discovered that her ex-husband hadnapost ended a previous relationship until June that year.  She alleges that after they were married, she discovered heaposd had aposflingsapos with four more women which lead the pair to attend marriage counselling. After finding out about a sixth woman, Chrissy decided to end the relationship. Chrissy said: I received some messages from an ex about five months into the relationship. I didnapost believe it and I didnapost think he was that person. I just didnapost believe anything that anybody was saying. We were already married by the time I found out about the second woman.  One year into marriage we had marriage counselling but it doesnapost work because the counsellor would tell him what he was doing and he wouldnapost want to go again. In summer  I decided Iaposd had enough. I would go on his phone and see him talking to other women saying they were sleeping together but I wouldnapost contact the women because they didnapost know about me because heaposd lied to them. I just felt devastated. I married this man and started a family with him. Iaposm not one to hold grudges. It was hard but it was a blessing. Chrissy, who has two children, Dominique, , and Brayden, six, stomped on the dress, dragged it through the mud and waded through a lake in it before soaking it in wine and setting it on fire. She said the gown had been her dream dress when she got married in a country themed wedding three years ago but after a tough orce, she was happy to destroy it. Chrissyaposs ex-husband said: Thereaposs a whole lot of stuff that goes on in le and Iaposm not choosing to talk about it. Thereaposs a lot more that you donapost know.

The warm water can also bring relief to the aching limbs we often experience when we fall ill. Next, dose up on vitamin C by including oranges or kiwi in your breakfast, or by simply throwing fresh berries in with your porridge. The bad news for hot drink fans is tea and coffee should be the last drink you reach for, with nutritionist Amanda Ursell explaining the caffeine content of the drinks may dehydrate you further, so stick the the orange juice instead.

They can be picked up online for around £.  Afternoon GP Dr Sarah Brewer recommended staying inside and keeping warmyou feeling a cold coming on. If the nose gets too cold, these immune systems don’t work properly, so you are more susceptible to infection, she explained. Staying indoors also limits the spread of infection.

So stock up.He also advised to stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water to beat that scratchy feeling that develops at the back of our throats when the temperatures drop. Alcohol can dehydrate you further so itaposs best to stay off the booze for a bit. Nutritionist Amanda recommended snacking on nuts, as they contain selenium which supports our immune systems.  Evening Saving the best until last, having a cold is the perfect excuse to get a curry in. Amanda said the hot spices can irritate the lining of your nose, making it easier to clear and helping us feel aposinstantlyapos better.

The sign had people in stitches, as it appears bosses of the surgery in Plumstead, south-east London had commissioned the sign, not giving much thought to the bit of the list where they explain how new and innovative they are. What do you think about the sign  Let us know in the commentsThe full sign reads: NHS  private, emergency treatment, new patients welcome, home visits for the elderly and disabled cosmetic dentistry, tooth jewellery. Something about new innovations. Nervous and anxious patients welcome sundries, late nights available by appointment, disabled access.

An impressive  per cent of the population over the age of  in the tiny Pacic country of Palau have had a Covid jab, said the Red Cross - which puts them out in front as the nation with most vaccinations. Palau is an archipelago of  islands in the western Pacic Ocean but despite its remoteness it is ahead of the pack with its vaccination programme. The size of its population will have had an impact though as there are only , people in Palau. The Red Cross has published the country with the most vaccinations to encourage nations to boost their rollout with Palau having moved into top spot.  Last month it was Portugal who were top of the list with  per cent of its  million people having been inoculated. In Western Europe, Portugal is still out in front with . per cent of people vaccinated while the UK’s rollout has slowed down and there are .% of the population who have had a jab. Palau is not alone amongst Pacic nations that have had high rollouts but there are many which are lagging behind - including small countries. Fewer than  per cent of the , population in the Solomon Islands or , people in Kiribati have been vaccinated, said the Red Cross. Then in Papua New Guinea, fewer than  per cent of the population have been jabbed, according to Our World in Data figures.  In the UK there has been a surge in Covid infections among children that has helped leave the country with the highest case rates and deaths in Western Europe. A lack of vaccinations for children has been put down as a reason for these worrying rates. After one of the fastest vaccine rollouts in the world other countries have now caught up with the UK. France, which has vaccinated more children than Britain, is among those countries with a higher proportion of the population as a whole vaccinated. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: “These data demonstrate that while our vaccination programme continues to make a huge dference, the pandemic is not over. “While cases remain high, the vaccination programme is ensuring that this does not translate to a similarly high number of hospitalisations and deaths. “We are urging everyone who is eligible to come forward for vaccination. It is the best way to reduce transmission and protect ourselves and those we love.” Official data shows just  per cent of  to  year olds had been vaccinated in England as of Monday .

Gil Wizen was staying at a reserve in Napo province of eastern Ecuador, when he followed a trail of baby spiders in his bedroom to find a Brazilian wandering spider and its offspring.The spider, which is as big as a human hand, had taken refuge under Mr Wilzen’s bed where she was seemingly guarding her children, the Daily Star reported.Mr Wizen managed to take a photograph to document his face to face encounter with the venomous creature, capturing an image which has now won him a prestigious award. The spider room, which is the name given to the image, saw Mr Wilzen awarded the Wildle Photographer of the Year award for Urban Wildle. According to notes on the award website, Mr Wilzen used forced perspective to make it appear even larger. Following the success in capturing the moment, a daring Mr Wilzen safely relocated the spider outside. Speaking on his blog about the photograph, in a post which appears to be from , he said: Not only there were literally thousands of spiderlings under the bed, right beside them rested one of the biggest aposnon-tarantulaapos spiders I have ever seen. “Its bodywas mm but with its leg span it could easily cover my hand.  Brazilian wandering spiders are more commonly known to roam forest floors at night rather than bedrooms. They search for prey such as frogs and cockroaches. Although their toxic venom can be deadly to mammals including humans, it can also be used for medicinal uses. The overall winner for this year’s Wildle Photographer of the Year went to French biologist and underwater photographer Laurent Ballesta. She managed to capture a camouflage grouper fish swimming around in a cloud of eggs and sperm. Other winning photos included fighting fish, an inquisitive underwater elephant, a calm gorilla and a beautul reflection in a coral reef.

Matt Streatfeild, from Newcastle, New South Wales, in Australia, came across the message from the past as he knocked down two walls in his home as part of a renovation. Intrigued he opened the letter dated April , , and to his surprise found it was written from the plasterers who built the walls. It was meant to give future generations an idea of what le was like back in the mid-s. You always hear the legend of messages in a bottle, but you never think youaposll find one in between two walls in your own house, Mr Streatfeild said. The letter said the workers from Newcastle Interior Linings, which still exists today, earned each week and that the bottle was one of the first measured in metric being equal to a “one imperial pint”.  The workers were also listed and Mr Streatfeild was able to track down Ron Niddrie, one of the plasterers who is now aged . One of these little mementos has paid off, Mr Niddrie told NBN News.. The fact that it was  years ago was even more of a shock. The message stated: “We are waiting for our weekly wages which are, gross, . .  “The bottle is one of the early metric, as we are beginning a metric conversion, it is equal to one imp pint.” Mr Streatfeild now says that he will now put the bottle back behind the new wall when it is built and add a bottle of his own for future generations. When we re-sheet this wall weaposre going to place the old bottle that we found from  with that piece of history, and weaposre going to add our own, he said. Little face mask from  and a bit of a description of how leaposs been for the last couple of years.

win at Glenrothes last week.Director of rugby Russell Arthur said: “Not only did we score tries, but preventing the Fers from scoring a point gave us great encouragement, taking us to second place in the league.#Caithness will also be bidding to consolidate after handing Grangemouth Stags their first defeat of the season.The highlight of the - win was the two tries scored by Evan Sutherland, enabling the talented back-rower to beat his father’s record of  touchdowns for the club.“They were both great achievements, but Evan now has the opportunity to go on to score  and more. Hopefully he will start the new run at Blairgowrie on Saturday,” said Ewan Boyd, the Millbank side’s head coach.In the same ision, Ellon will want to bounce back quickly from losing out - at Dunfermline, which is bad news for bottom side Glenrothes, who are the visitors to the Meadows.In Caley  North, Moray can go back to the top of the ision should they beat nd Aberdeen Grammar, while league leaders nd Highland are not in action.Ross Sutherland are at home to Mackie FP’s with both teams set on pushing up to challenge for promotion.Caley  North leaders Dyce make the long haul to Thurso where they play nd Caithness, but full of the confidence of winning, especially after their fine - win over Aberdeen University Medics.Dyce’s new president Nick Cheyne said: #We are under no illusions about the challenge of this trip, never mind the game, but we are in good heart after a good start to the season.”Second-placed Deeside travel to meet nd Ellon.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

This week, reporter Hilary Scott speaks to two men who, for several years, have helped people in the Borders...Itrsquos hard to believe that the Peeblesshire Foodbank has been running for almost a decade.When Francis Mordaunt and James Adams decided to join the small team of volunteers, they all thought the foodbank would be short-lived, a stop-gap while the economy recovered from the financial collapse.But the desperate crisis of people going hungry continued to rise, and the impact of the pandemic was felt most deeply by poorer households.Former manager Francis, and team leader James, have now retired from their roles.This week, they told me how the foodbank went from operating from a garage with a few referrals, to becoming a registered charity with premises in Cavalry Park, feeding hundreds of people across the county.The foodbank was formed in  following a meeting held at St.Peters Episcopal Church, initiated by the Rector Rev Jim Benton-Evans.Rev Jim was chairman, Katie Buckingham was secretary, and the manager was Gillian Hughes. The board of governors included several clergy, a headteacher, a local councillor and several others, who decided to operated under the auspices of The Trussell Trust, who were involved in many other foodbanks in the UK.Francis retired to Peebles that year and joined the congregation of St Peterrsquos.ldquoHaving told Rev Jim that I was interested in becoming involved in the community, he invited me to become a volunteer, he said.ldquoMany years earlier, while living in Edinburgh, I had helped at the Old St.Pauls Ritz Cafeacute that provided breakfasts during the week to the homeless men and women in the Grassmarket and central Edinburgh. So volunteering at the foodbank in Peebles appealed to me as it was another opportunity to help those who for whatever reason were going hungry.Initially, Francisrsquos voluntary role was packing food parcels at the Bakehouse Hall and delivering them.ldquoIn those early days, the food was stored in Enid Clariersquos garage in March Street Lane, he said.In Autumn , local MP David Mundell officially opened the Peeblesshire Foodbank, and Francis was appointed treasurer.Francis said: ldquoI inherited a positive bank balance from the initial fundraising efforts before I became a volunteer. Unfortunately, our costs were almost non-existent, so there was little to do the first purchase I remember was a set of scales as the Trussell Trust required us to weigh all food donations in and out and record them on a central database.The foodbank soon moved to more permanent premises in Cavalry Park with storage space for food donations.Francis added: ldquoWe now had a modest rent to pay, insurance costs and a mobile phone but few other costs. The Trussell Trust required us to become a charity, and Rev Jim asked me to complete the application to the Scottish Charity Commission.The Peeblesshire Foodbank became a registered charity in January , and two years later, Rev Jim handed over the reins of the foodbank.Before departing, he set up a management structure to ensure the foodbank continued to run smoothly.Francis, who was appointed as manager, worked with team leader James Adams.Rev Callum MacDougall was the chairman until his retirement in , when Father Tony Lappin took up the position.ldquoOnce the pandemic hit the premises at Cavalry Park became hopelessly small, and Father Tony arranged for the foodbank to move temporarily to St Josephrsquos Hall, explained Francis.ldquoSo one of my last actions for the foodbank before retiring was to arrange the rental of the new much bigger premises in Cavalry Park where the Peeblesshire foodbank is now located.Since its inception, the number of people reaching out to the foodbank for help has grown rapidly.ldquoIn the early years, we had up to two referrals a week, about  a year with an average of two people fed per referral. That meant we were feeding about  people a year, said Francis. ldquoBy , that had increased to nearly  people a year, and by  it was over .Francis said the role made him quite emotional at times: ldquoIn several cases, the recipients burst into tears on receiving their food parcels delivered to their doors. It meant a lot to me to see the gratitude as the foodbank was meeting an urgent need.Jamesrsquos involvement in the foodbank echoed Francisrsquos, as he retired to Peebles from Belfast in  and joined St Peterrsquos Church.He said: ldquoMy we and I were anxious to get involved with the community and make friends, and to help with a foodbank seemed a worthwhile opportunity.Recalling the old days when they used a garage to store food, James said: ldquoIt had no heat or light and littleany shelving, but it was a base. Donations were mainly from Tesco collections.ldquoThere was a book recording parcels issued, and my memory was that perhaps only four or five were issued in an average week, and there was a description of the call and the circumstances. I donrsquot think the availability of the Foodbank was well publicised at that time.However, he says there was a dficult period when he and Francis struggled to keep up with demand.ldquoWe ended up covering  days at a time, which was not sustainable. We were, on average, delivering around eight parcels per week at that time.Appeals for help brought in big-hearted community volunteers.James said: ldquoWe were able to move to a four-week rota, and Billtook responsibility for uplting donations and collecting empty boxes. In addition, positive steps were taken to advertise the foodbank and increase usage, and leaders met at intervals to discuss all aspects of the foodbank. This was, I believe when things began to move forward.Although the charity had an army of volunteers, financial constraints were a concern.ldquoIn the beginning, money was scarce, and there was always a worrywe could continue to afford the premises when we moved to Caly Park, said James.However, both have paid tribute to ldquosuper fundraiser, Nancy Fenton.James added: ldquoNancy held a coffee morning and progressed from that to raising money by selling a wide iety of items online. The work she put in was phenomenal, as was the cash raised, but these efforts raised the profile of the foodbank as well. Her efforts gave us a very secure financial base which has provided some security as the Foodbank progresses.In addition, local churches, businesses, charities and iniduals raised funds for the foodbank, usually on their own initiative.And iniduals have been making financial donations directly to the bank account via the website.Francis added: ldquoDonations of food, particularly through the local supermarket collection points, always continued at a high level, and shortages were only ever confined to a relatively few inidual items. The generosity of the Peeblesshire community has been incredible.Reflecting on his days delivering food parcels to those in need, James said: ldquoThere were people, mainly those living alone, who I delivered to more than a few times. I rightly or wrongly felt that they found it dficult simply to cope with le in general, and the foodbank was essential to simply feed themselves.Ultimately, COVID and age marked the end of Francis and Jamesrsquos incredible journey with the Peeblesshire Foodbank.The Trussell Trust stood down everyone over the age of  years.During the pandemic, one thing thatrsquos brightened our lives has been the stories of the everyday heroes doing their bit to support people through these dficult days.Together, these two selfless gentlemen worked tirelessly for several years making sure struggling families had a meal to put on the table.They are the retiring heroes behind Peeblesshire Foodbank, who helped countless people."},{"url":null,"title":"former-jed-forest-star-completes-ninth-charity-marathon","story":"FORMER Jed-Forest star Chris Laidlaw is now three quarters of the way through his lsquo in  marathon challengersquo.Laidlaw, who hails from Jedburgh has been running a marathon each month this year to raise funds for three charities which mean a lot to him - the Murrayfield Injured Players Foundation Marie Curie and Alzheimerrsquos Scotland.His first marathon took place on New Yearrsquos Day on a -mile course near Edinburgh and since then he has run another eight.This was ato happy territory for him as he set out from Fisherrow Harbour in Musselburgh and finished at Hallhill, home ground for Dunbar Rugby Club, where he spent three years as Development Officer.He said: ldquoThe marathons donrsquot get any easier.

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

At times, of course, it felt like there was actually more than one Renton.In his pomp during the golf season, the sun would never set on his honest voice as he provided all sorts of outlets with updates while displaying the canny, multi-tasking abilities of a Swiss Army kne.ldquoI was once providing radio reports from three dferent golf events from around the world and I said to the producer, lsquoDonrsquot say, lsquoRenton Laidlaw reports from such and suchrsquo as Irsquom going to be giving you updates from events in England, Australia and Spain, he recalled in an interview on his le with this correspondent earlier this year.ldquoBut when I went on they did say lsquoRenton Laidlaw reports from Wentworth, lsquoRenton Laidlaw reports from Melbourne, lsquoRenton Laidlaw reports from Madridrsquo.ldquoPeter Alliss, he added, ldquoalways did say that there were two or three Renton Laidlaws. The truth of the matter was that I was not at any of those venues. I was making these calls from a grimy phone box in Ealing and just trying to provide a service. It was like a true Ealing comedy.To golf enthusiasts the world over, Laidlawrsquos soft, welcoming, distinctive voice brought a congenial familiarity to this great game. His was a style that was as warm, comforting and dependable as a bobbled cardigan.ldquoI used to be on the World Service for years and folk would recognise my voice around the globe, he told me. ldquoI would be talking on a plane and someone would say lsquoitrsquos Renton Laidlaw isnrsquot it rsquoldquoIrsquod be thinking, lsquois this some long lost cousin I donrsquot know rsquo and they would tell me they knew my voice from the radio.From a foot in the door with the Edinburgh Evening News in his home city, Laidlaw would become a journalist and broadcaster of global renown before ill-health led to retirement in Drumoig, where he lived with his sister, Jenner.Laidlaw covered his first Open back in , while he would become the first non-American reporter to reach the milestone of  Masters tournaments, in .In total, the Scot covered  majors including  Opens and  Masters, as well as golfrsquos other showpiece occasions, in a globe-trotting working le that spanned six decades.His zealous lust for his profession would often draw great praise from his colleagues. The late, great doyen, Jock MacVicar, who himself sadly passed away earlier this year, would relay a tale which underlined Laidlawrsquos energetic work ethic.While doing television work for STV with the celebrated Arthur Montford, Laidlaw was also providing radio reports for BBC Scotland.ldquoOn one remarkable occasion, while doing his stint as a commentator on STV, he was to be seen, during each commercial break, careering down the ladder from the control hut, wrote Jock of Laidlawrsquos lively display of media plate-spinning.ldquoIn two minutes flat he would telephone a piece to Radio Scotland, career back up the ladder and be at his post again by the time the last advert faded off the screen.As well as a spell with the London Evening Standard, Laidlaw would serve as the BBCrsquos golf correspondent for  years while his work with the Golf Channel in the US gave him authority and acclaim on the other side of the Atlantic.Golf was his le, and it was a le well-lived.

I couldnrsquot sit down. He was like royalty to me.Laidlaw, too, was a regal figure in the game. The BBCrsquos current golf correspondent, the excellent Iain Carter, described Laidlaw as ldquoa colossus of the golfing media and, above all, an absolute gentleman.He certainly was. Laidlawrsquos stature was considerable but he remained an unassuming, wonderfully welcoming and generous man of engaging wit and wisdom.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

Reduced to crossing his fingers for a mild winter, Kwasi Kwarteng is showing just how much a decade of inaction from Government has left us vulnerable.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Greater transparency on how their s are putting young users at risk and the steps they are taking to address these problems and make services safe by design must now be a top priority for them.In response, a Facebook company spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore committed to keeping young people who use our  safe. Wersquove spent  billion dollars on safety in recent years ndash including developing tools to enhance the safety and wellbeing of young people across Facebook and Instagram.ldquoWersquove shared more information with researchers and academics than any other  and we will find ways to allow external researchers more access to our data in a way that respects peoplersquos privacy.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He gave an alcohol reading or  microgrammes per ml of breath, which is more than six times the limit.Just a week later, in the early hours of th August, officers on patrol noticed Willmottrsquos car with its lights on in a layby of the A near Voe,Willmott was in the driving seat, with the keys in the ignition. Although the engine was off at the time, officers noticed a rear brake disk was still warm.Willmott was again arrested and taken to the police station. This time he gave a reading of  microgrammes per ml of breath, which is almost four times the legal limit.Mr MacKenzie said the test readings were ldquoextremely high.He applied for the sherf to forfeit Willmottrsquos car, valued at between pound,, and pound,, as part of sentencing.He said the fact Willmott was caught twice in a week showed he was potentially a ldquosignicant risk to the public, which could be ldquomitigated by depriving him of access to his motor vehicle.ldquoHe may well be someone whose judgement is so impaired by his addiction that the risk remains very high, Mr MacKenzie said.ldquoHe has simply not been able to cope, he said.ldquoHe is terried about going to jail,# he added.Mr Allan appealed for the sherf not to forfeit Willmottrsquos car, which he was still paying off to a finance company.He said even at the cheapest estimates it was a ldquosignicant penalty to someone who is at the moment going through the process of applying for universal credit.Sherf Cruickshank agreed not to forfeit the car, saying the financial impact on Willmott would be ldquodisproportionate.He said the community payback order, requiring supervision for  months, was an alternative to custodial sentence.Willmott was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work over a year.He was disqualied from driving for  months for each of the two charges, although the period of the ban can be reduced by a quarterhe takes a drink driving awareness course.A man who crashed into the front of a house after a high speed police chase while almost five times over the drink drive limitPupils’ artwork has been damaged by vandals.A dangerous driver almost caused a crash near Lerwick last week.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1634132049562.jpg--covid_19___wed_13th_october_figures.jpg?1634132049000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211013newscovid 19 wed 13th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.

And last week, Andrew Larmour of the Gertrude Star Flute Band ed to Ballymena to hand over a massive cheque for pound, to Jake and his mum Karen who live in Ballykeel.Back in September, Andrew and fellow Star members were joined by members of Ballymena-based flute bands on the long, footsore trek.And while they may well be used to stepping out on parade the local bandsmen can justiably claim to have gone the extra mile on their mega march for a cause close to their hearts.Five-year-old Jake was diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma in September .Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a very rare cancer that affects the blood cells and the immune system of the patient and mainly affects children between the ages of  and .When Jake woke with a wheezy chest, his mum Karen contacted the GP straight away. Jake was prescribed anti-biotics and his mum was advised to use a humidier and also a steamy bathroom. There was no improvement in Jake’s condition and the family spent  weeks going back and forth trying to find out just why their little boy was so ill. Eventually a visit to AE and blood tests led to Jake being referred to the RVH Children’s Hospital where they received the devastating diagnosis.“It has been a really dficult time for Jake,” said Karen “as he missed all of his P year, with the exception of a few days. “We are all very grateful for the fantastic suppport we’ve received from these bandsmen.”Among the marchers in September was local councillor, Rodney Quigley who said that the joint effort by the band members was to be praised.“I couldn’t make the entire walk because of prior engagements but I was proud to be there at the .am start in East Belfast with my local band colleagues. “Jake has relations in the ranks of Gertude Star Flute Band and it was their idea to do the walk to Ballymena.“I know their fund raising page has received a lot of donations from local bands and its great to see such unity on the marching band front,” he said. One of the walk’s organisers, Gertrude Star’s Andrew Larmour said the walk to Ballymena was one of the proudest days of his le.“Walking with my Gertrude brothers and making three new friends for le in GeorgeBarr , Lyle Murray and Rodney Quigley was an honour.“It is great to know that we have helped Jake and his mum Karen Oliver through this event.” Karen and Jake were there to welcome the intrepid walkers to Ballymena and she said she was overwhelmed by the generosity shown.She said: “Tonight Jake,Emelia and I met up with everyone walking at Queen Street and finished the walk with them! “We cannot thank you all enough! Jake was a little out of sorts due to increasing his Saturday chemotherapy dosage but he just stayed in my arms and took it all in this evening.“ I wish I could thank absolutely every one in person for joining the walk and giving donations you have all blown us away by your generosity.”Last week. Andrew posted: “Went down to Ballymena to hand over what was raised on our sponsored walk a few weeks ago.  “Can now say after counting final total tonight cheque and cash pound was raised in aid of wee Jake Oliver. “Again Id like thank everyone that donated to the sponsored walk also the ones that took part on the walk and Gertrude Star , Pride of the Maine and Ballykeel LSOU bands. “Your generosity didnt go unnoticed thank you.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4157474.jpg--.jpg?1634222796000\n","title":"nipsa wants stormont department to take over management of council","story":"NIPSA has confirmed that it has written to the Minister for Communities asking that the Department takes over the managementat Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.

Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

Credit: Jmac.PhotosGillian HallidayTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s oldest postman has retired after nearly  years serving his community, marking the milestone by celebrating his th birthday.Liam O’Rourke, who lives in Convoy, Co Donegal, started delivering the post in Omagh, Co Tyrone when he joined Royal Mail at the age of .He previously worked in jobs for a number of firms before applying to join the postal service.After a few years on the door-to-door beat, he took up a role working at the Omagh sorting office, where he marked his last day in the job on Wednesday.“I guess I was the oldest and now I’m retired,” Liam told the Belfast .“I did love the job. It was quite the experience. I put a lot into it and there was highs and lows, but mostly highs.”Liam said he took the role of handling the public’s mail seriously, explaining: “Just generally, you have to have a certain amount of security about it and respect for other people. You have to ensure that things keep moving along. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I’d been based in the office for about  years, sorting mail for delivery, doing the wages and things like that.”He has witnessed the job transform over the years from hands-on to the advent of machines to sort the mail, speeding up the process.The Donegal man said his last day in his job, which was first reported by the Ulster Herald, was “just another day in the office”, but his colleagues helped ensure it was memorable.“I didn’t do anything dferent, really. I didn’t want a fuss, but there was sandwiches, cakes and buns,” he added.Delivering the post is something of a family trade for Liam, with his sons Paul and Richard based in the Omagh office and his grandson Kyle having been a postman for five years.“Richard mainly worked with me and Kyle gets his mail from the Omagh office in the morning and goes to Dromore to deliver it,” he said.One demand of the role Liam is more than happy to say goodbye to is the eye-watering early starts.“The last while, especially since Covid, I’ve been getting up for work at am and getting into work for am, driving from Donegal, then my sht would end at .pm,” he said. “The way we worked was a three-day week, doing double shts.”Now that he has extra free time on his hands, Liam is planning to get more involved with his local Gaelic football team.“I do a bit of training and I’m involved with the senior team a bit as well” he said. “I’ve a big interest in the county team as well. I’ve plenty to keep me going.”With more than four decades of memories to look back on at the Omagh office, Liam has plenty of memories, good and bad.Among the worst is Omagh’s darkest moment: the day the Real IRA blew up the town centre. The atrocity, on August , , killed  people, including a woman pregnant with twins, nine children and three generations of one family.It was the single biggest tragedy of the Troubles, and took place three months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.“I was working that Saturday. It never leaves you. [In] the aftermath... the photographers, the post office was overrun with Press doing stories. They used the roof of the post office because it was the highest point in the town for photographs.”He also recalled the official visit to Omagh by then United States president Bill Clinton and his we Hillary, who mourned with the victims of the attack a month later.“It was a big thing when he came, all the security that surrounded him,” Liam told the Belfast “Loads of things happened over the years. All sorts of things happened during the Troubles, but the last  years, it has settled down and been good. “During those early years it was rough, though.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentNI high street voucher: Reports people offered Spend Local card for cashUUP’s Lord Empey demands answers from Ian Paisley over claim PM promised to ‘tear up’ NI ProtocolHatchback for the price of a luxury x: Expat stunned by £, -day car hire quote in NIDiane Dawson: People called me a Sinn Fein Trojan horse, but there was nothing from paramilitariesTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayIrish leaders hopeful of Northern Ireland Protocol agreementLatest Northern IrelandSefcovic warns Number  that NI Protocol isn’t up for negotiationFinancial package for GPs in NI will not be tied to number of face-to-face appointmentsAllison MorrisOpinionUVF killer Garfield Beattie may be latest loyalist to lose his get-out-of-jail cardMark Allen is on a roll after wowing WaterfrontPSNI detective got £k overtime on top of salary as force’s bill hits £k a dayLatestSefcovic warns Number  that NI Protocol isn’t up for negotiationColum Eastwood to meet SDLP members over Fermanagh and South Tyrone selection rowFinancial package for GPs in NI will not be tied to number of face-to-face appointmentsAllison MorrisOpinionUVF killer Garfield Beattie may be latest loyalist to lose his get-out-of-jail cardAndrew TrimbleOpinionHonest RHI boiler owners are sick and tired of being treated appallingly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A spokesperson added: Numerous factors, from access to staff and dficulties in vehicle supply due to the current semi-conductors crisis and the related fleet shortage, to the increased levels of cleaning between rentals weigh on the costs for the rental sector as a whole.Had Belfast native Colin been going in the opposite direction, and seeking to hire a car in France, he could have had a luxury Range Rover Velar — which costs nearly £, new — for the same money.He also revealed that he’d paid less than £ back in May  for BOTH his flights to and from Northern Ireland and car rental.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I kept my receipt, which shows it cost just €.to hire a car from May  until May  in Northern Ireland two years ago,” he told this newspaper.“When I priced a similar car this time, the hire cost from October  until November  was between £, and £, for the cheapest vehicles.”Research from the Belfastdiscovered that it is possible to hire cheaper vehicles, but we also found that there are signicant iations in price, depending on the website you choose.We also discovered that higher prices are quotedyou are inquiring online from the EU, with the average hike around %. Colin said he consulted the Europcar site, which he’d used previously as it’s linked to the airline with which he is flying.Bewildered by the results, he revealed that he’d also looked at the price of hiring vehicles in Paris for the sake of comparison.“I decided to price an equivalent rental period in Paris and it was almost the exact same pricefor a Range Rover,” he said.“That’s quite a bargain, compared with the Vauxhall Crossland [worth £,] you’d get for the same money in Belfast.The -year-old continued: “Whatever way you look at it, the price of renting a vehicle in Northern Ireland has gone up by an astronomical amount.”Mr Young, who was hoping to hire a small car, said the cheapest available options he was quoted were a Vauxhall Corsafor £,. or a Crossland Xat £,..The pick-up and drop-off point on both vehicles on both dates was Belfast International Airport. “When I hired a car back in May  it worked out around £. a day,” he said.“ButI wanted to rent a similar vehicle this October, you’re talking about £. per day being advertised.”Colin, who lives with his partner Cecile and their son Joelin the French capital, made his original booking with Europcar, which he also consulted ahead of this year’s trip.But he revealed that he also checked the cost of car rental on other comparison websites, but found “they were all coming up the same”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentNI high street voucher: Reports people offered Spend Local card for cashUUP’s Lord Empey demands answers from Ian Paisley over claim PM promised to ‘tear up’ NI ProtocolHatchback for the price of a luxury x: Expat stunned by £, -day car hire quote in NIDiane Dawson: People called me a Sinn Fein Trojan horse, but there was nothing from paramilitariesTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayIrish leaders hopeful of Northern Ireland Protocol agreementLatest Northern IrelandSefcovic warns Number  that NI Protocol isn’t up for negotiationFinancial package for GPs in NI will not be tied to number of face-to-face appointmentsAllison MorrisOpinionUVF killer Garfield Beattie may be latest loyalist to lose his get-out-of-jail cardMark Allen is on a roll after wowing WaterfrontPSNI detective got £k overtime on top of salary as force’s bill hits £k a dayLatestSefcovic warns Number  that NI Protocol isn’t up for negotiationColum Eastwood to meet SDLP members over Fermanagh and South Tyrone selection rowFinancial package for GPs in NI will not be tied to number of face-to-face appointmentsAllison MorrisOpinionUVF killer Garfield Beattie may be latest loyalist to lose his get-out-of-jail cardFormer NSYNC star Lance Bass announces baby news with husband Michael Turchin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are a lot of people who are lost in the process and don#t know how to avail of the voucher either.​A spokesperson for Department for Economy said: “All illegal activity, or suspected illegal activity, should be reported to the PSNI”.The PSNI said it has not received any such reports..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandDepartment for the EconomyMore On Police Service of Northern Ireland PremiumPSNI detective got £k overtime on top of salary as force’s bill hits £k a dayTwo further arrests in PSNI fraud and money laundering operation linked to New IRAKatrina Rainey Knockloughrim murder: Police granted extra  hours to question manIntruder discovered in Omagh care home resident’s room PremiumMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentMost ReadMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentNI high street voucher: Reports people offered Spend Local card for cashUUP’s Lord Empey demands answers from Ian Paisley over claim PM promised to ‘tear up’ NI ProtocolHatchback for the price of a luxury x: Expat stunned by £, -day car hire quote in NIDiane Dawson: People called me a Sinn Fein Trojan horse, but there was nothing from paramilitariesTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayIrish leaders hopeful of Northern Ireland Protocol agreementLatest Northern IrelandSefcovic warns Number  that NI Protocol isn’t up for negotiationFinancial package for GPs in NI will not be tied to number of face-to-face appointmentsAllison MorrisOpinionUVF killer Garfield Beattie may be latest loyalist to lose his get-out-of-jail cardMark Allen is on a roll after wowing WaterfrontPSNI detective got £k overtime on top of salary as force’s bill hits £k a dayLatestSefcovic warns Number  that NI Protocol isn’t up for negotiationColum Eastwood to meet SDLP members over Fermanagh and South Tyrone selection rowFinancial package for GPs in NI will not be tied to number of face-to-face appointmentsAllison MorrisOpinionUVF killer Garfield Beattie may be latest loyalist to lose his get-out-of-jail cardFormer NSYNC star Lance Bass announces baby news with husband Michael Turchin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Stephen Jones, who works for Climate Northern Ireland, will be among  delegates from  countries taking part in a six-week online policy and leadership programme and will gain exclusive access to policy experts and training, discuss policy ideas with UK Parliamentarians and Government and be mentored by UK think tanks and other senior leaders. googletag.cmd.push In partnership with the prestigious Moslashller Institute at Cambridge University, Future Leaders Connect aims to help delegates develop their skills, expand their networks and ultimately, make policy change. Stephen , who originally went toLimavadyGrammar School, was selected from over , applicants worldwide and as part of the process, had to pitch his global policy vision – choosing to focus on climate action. He has over seven years experience co-ordinating climate change adaptation in Northern Ireland, holds an MSc from Queens University Belfast and has experience as a Red Cross Volunteer on the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. Speaking ahead of the programme, he said: “I applied to Future Leaders Connect to educate myself on how to make the biggest impact with good policy. This is especially important in the s, at a time when the stakes of making good decisions are higher than ever before. I also wanted to bring my own experience of supporting organisations to plan for climate impacts, to work with folks from around the world, and to raise the profile of climate resilience. “Following the programme,I plan to raise the issue of climate impacts up the agenda this year and I will be running a session at the COP summit in Glasgow in November to do just that.     It is also important that we get good climate change legislation in Northern Ireland, as we are the last place in the UK and Ireland to get it, so I hope to be able to better engage with this process.” Speaking further about his policy vision he said: “Evenwe stop all greenhouse gasemissions today, we have locked in changes to the climate system. These changes mean that natural weather extremes like flooding, heat and storms are becoming more intense and frequent, and on a huge scale. The means we require immediate action, so my policy vision is for resilience to climate change impacts to be given equal footing to cutting greenhouse gases. We have to do these two actions together. “This is not currently the case in Northern Ireland, or anywhere . I have been working on this professionally for more than seven years in Northern Ireland, but this is a global issue which is underdeveloped and needs support. It will be those least able to deal with the impacts who are at most risk.” For this Centenary year, the programme has been expanded in Northern Ireland to ten places instead of the usual two, through the support of the Northern Ireland Office, with Stephen joined on the programme by nine other delegates from Northern Ireland. Stephen Jones Across the six weeks they will connect with emerging leaders from Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Ukraine, Vietnam and the rest of the UK. Congratulating Stephen and the nine other Northern Ireland participants, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis,said:“I’m proud that the Northern Ireland Office is supporting the expansion of the programmethis Centenary year, meaning more young people from Northern Ireland will be taking part. “It’s a fantastic opportunity for them to hear from leaders around the world and learn how governments can work together to tackle the great global issues of the day. Also speaking about the programme,Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Irelandsaid: “We’re delighted to be able to announce the ten exceptional iniduals from Northern Ireland taking part in this year’s global programme. Future Leaders Connect is an opportunity for emerging leaders in Northern Ireland to collaborate with their counterparts from all over the world, and to benefit from the sharing of ideas and knowledge in tackling global issues and challenges. “The application process was extremely competitive, and we are certain that our ten young leaders whose backgrounds range from law and politics to housing and the environment, will make positive changes in Northern Ireland. We wish them every success in the programme.” This year’s Future Leaders Connect programme officially kicked off yesterdayand will run for six weeks online until November .

Monny McSorleywas just  years old when she passed away in April , after suffering a heart attack. The grandmother was just weeks away from her th birthday. googletag.cmd.push Last month her four daughters Ciara, Carla, Aileen and Erin and husband Eamon organised a  hour walk at Watty Graham GAC. The walk, which saw each of the girls clock , steps each, raised pound, for BHF NI research. Monny’s daughter Carla said: “We have been blown away by people’s kindness. The people inMagheraand at Watty Graham’s GAC really went above and beyond in supporting the event and supporting us. We will be forever in each of your debt and you have our sincere thanks. Special thanks to Watty Grahams GAC for all their help in making the walk a possibility. Thanks also to the support of local businesses Bitz and Pizza and Crawfords for providing refreshments and Tommie McGraths and Christie Print for their help with t-shirts and banners. “Thank you so much to every single person who joined us on the walk. Any time we even thought about having a rest, more people would come along and walk with us sharing memories of mammy and taking our minds off our sore feet. .     “We each had dferent moments when it got really tough, but luckily we had each other to provide encouragement and see us through the challenging parts. There were definitely some blisters and sore feet the day after, but it was all worth it for mammy.” Having lost their mum during the pandemic, this walk was very special for everyone who knew Monny. Carla said the walk provided them with a chance to connect with those who had been unable to attend her mothers funeral or wake due to the lockdown. “Mammy died when we had just entered our first strict lockdown here, so we weren’t able to have a normal wake or funeral, she said. The -hour walk gave us the chance to see those people who would have come along to the wake and funeral during normal times. It was unbelievable the amount of people who showed up to walk with us and donate to BHF NI,” she added. Monny was known and loved throughout her local community for her charity volunteering and fundraising work, as well as working closely with children with special educational needs. Monny McSorley Head of BHF NI, Fearghal McKinney said: “The staggering amount raised is a testament to the woman who Monny was, so well respected and loved in her community. With an initial target of just pound,, they really outdid themselves, raising pound, more than what they had initially aimed for. “We are extremely grateful for the support which the McSorley family and theMagheracommunity have given BHF NI. Choosing to support future heart research and indeed other people affected by heart disease through their event was an incredibly thoughtful thing for them to do, especially in the wake of losing someone so close to them. “We couldn’t fund our le-saving heart and circulatory disease research without the support of families like Monny’s. When the BHF was formed seven out of  people died from a heart attack but thanks to the power of research now seven out of  people survive. But sadly, like Monny’s story shows, that is still too many people dying far too soon and leaving behind a devastated family. We urgently need to fund more research to save other families from this heartbreak.”  Over , new homes required in Mid Ulster by   A recent report on housing was published by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive .

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council voted earlier this year to hand control of Portstewart Town Hall back to its original owners - the Montagu Estate - after receiving Notice to Quit in . googletag.cmd.push Portstewart Community Associationhad called on the Department for Communities to intervene in the handover after a Public Records Office for Northern Irelanddocument appeared to cast doubt on the halls ownership arrangements. Under Section  of the Local Government Act, district councils must seek Ministerial approval for any disposal of land that is not at the best price or for the best rent. Department for Communities guidance says Section  also forms the basis for district councils to provide justication for a project and that the disposal is for the well-being of the district. However, a spokesperson for the Council said it does not consider Section  relevant on this occasion. Throughout Council’s long consideration of this matter legal advice confirmed that Council holds no title deeds for the building. The Montague Estate holds title, they said. Council’s Legal Team advised Council that the land in question is not registered in the Land Registry. Registry of Deeds searcheswere carried outfrom the s to present andhave no entries relating to the purchase of the Town Hall with a freehold title from the Montague Estate, . Council is aware of the PRONI document, but legal advice obtained and presented to Council advised that PRONI records are not proof of title and are only useful at providing general information.     It is possible any purchase price mentionedmay relate to a premium under a long lease. PRONI records also show Montague involvement with the Town Hall into the s. Council holds no title to the land and therefore Council does not consider Section  relevant as no transfer of land has taken place. The possibility of a community asset transfer to the people of Portstewart can only proceed with the agreement of the legal owner of the building, the Montague Estate. The community is free to engage with the Montague Estate regarding this matter. Last week, the Montagu Estate said they were disappointed years of neglect had resulted in the closure of the Town Hall. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all, they said in a statement released by their solicitor. Local councillor Angela Mulholland confirmed the community had made contact with the Estate. Wehavereachedouttothe Montaguestatetotrytofind awaytoreachapositive resolution, she said. Wewanttorally thecommunitytoactively engageinrestoringourtown hallandtheotherareasthat have been left neglected for so long. The Department for Communities said they have sought assurances from the Council. he Department has sought assurances from the Council, which have indicated that Section  does not apply in the case of Portstewart Town Hall, said a spokesperson.  Montagu Estate disappointed with years of neglect at Co Derry town hall  The Montagu Estate have released a statement on the halls handover.    Council accused of failing to do due diligence over town hall handover  A local community association has called on the Department for Communities to intervene.    County Derry community group ‘deeply disappointed’ by town hall handover  The group also expressed frustration that meetings were held in private.

Rory Conway, of Roshure Road, Magherafelt, contested a charge of driving with excess alcohol on his breath at Magherafelt Magistrates Court last week. The court heard from a police constable who had attended a call from two female witnesses who had followed the defendant home along the Draperstown Road and Roshure Road on September  . googletag.cmd.push The constable told the court he spoke to the witnesses outside the property who said they had seen the defendant at a petrol station in Draperstown and observing he was driving all over the road, had followed him and called the police. After speaking with the witnesses, the constable located a car in the driveway of the house on Roshure Road, and noted the bonnet was still warm. Conways partner answered the door, and when askedthe owner of the vehicle was home, the defendant, who had been in bed, appeared downstairs. The constable noted a smell of intoxicating liquor from Conway and conducted a preliminary breath test, where a reading of mg was recorded. The defendant was then arrested and taken to custody and on leaving after police interview, said: “Boys, it would have been worseyoud got me in the car.” Defence for Conway argued that as the comment had not been taken down in the constables notebook and read and signed by the defendant, it was inadmissible in court. They also said there was no evidence of the defendant driving the car, as both his partner and father had access to it.     The constable said he was not aware of anyone  inside the property at the time, and that the witnesses had described a male suspect. Statements given by the witnesses were then partially read out in court by Judge Mullan. One witness said she had observed Conway getting out of the car and urinating against the garage, before she asked him: “What do you think youre doing ” The statement said the defendant replied “What ” and moved towards the car, prompting the witness to ask: “Where are you going  You nearly caused an accident there.” Conway replied “Im sorry, Im going to my bed,” before the witness went round the back of the house and observed him at the side window with no shirt on, looking out at them. Counsel for the defence said the details in the statement meant that the witnesses should have been able to identy the defendant as part of the Viper procedure, which they were unable to do. Summing up, they told the court the defendant had not been detected driving the vehicle, that his unsolicited comment had been inadmissible and that he had not been identied by witnesses. The prosecution submitted that Conway was the owner of the vehicle and that there were two witnesses to his driving who were so concerned they had followed him home. Police had found the bonnet of the car to be warm, had spoken to the defendant and noted there didnt appear to be anyone  in the house. It was also noted Conway did not deny the charge at interview. Judge Mullan found the defendant guilty of driving with excess alcohol on his breath, and said the failure of the defence to call Conway to give evidence was a factor in the decision. She disqualied the defendant from driving for a period of  months, and issued a fine of pound, alongside an offenders levy of pound.

With the next Assembly election only months away, the campaign rhetoric has already started – and turned sour – with unionists openly mooting exploiting a loophole that could deny Sinn Feacutein or the SDLP the First Minister role should either be the largest party in Stormont. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin of People Before Profit, while angered by the political manoeuvring is not entirely surprised that there are those seeking to pushing the boundaries saying “democracy has always been a sham” at Stormont. He said: “The threat by the DUP, UUP and TUV to refuse a First Minister they dont agree with harks back to the worst of the sectarian unionist veto. “While its no surprise, it does expose the hypocrisy of parties with pretensions to upholding democracy. “This isnt just an insult to nationalists, it is an insult to everyone who believes in democracy. There is an ever increasing number of people who identy as neither unionist or nationalist. “We share the sense of outrage many people feel. The veto on democracy must go. “The Civil Rights movement arose as a people power challenge to a sectarian Stormont regime for basic democratic rights. “Every democratic demand for equality was resisted, often violently, by those prepared to determined to defend the status quo. “The new Stormont purports to be a democratic institution, however, it is anything but. State sectarianism is still embedded in the new Stormont political carve-up.     “In Stormont, establishment unionism and nationalism, dismissed workers rights, womens rights, LGBTQ rights, respect for the Irish language and racial equality for decades.“ “Political establishment parties have shted on some of these demands, certainly not all and not far enough, because of relentless people power campaigning. “But the kneejerk anti-democratic instincts of all the governing parties isnt far from the surface. “The shocking undemocratic treatment of the Black Lives Matter protests was greenlighted and subsequently rubber-stamped by all five of the Executive parties. “Democratic access to the right to choose  None of the five Executive parties are making a fuss about the continued denial of abortion services. “The whitewashed investigation of the ash for cash RHI scandal is another example of how the new Stormont regime has been prepared to trample on democracy. “The failure of the Stormont Executive to implement an anti-poverty strategy tramples on human rights and basic democracy. “The same applies to the refusal of the Executive to undo decades of undemocratic neglect of Derry and the North West thats evident in the failure to expand Magee, upgrade infrastructure or build adequate housing. “In the old and new Stormont, democracy has always been a sham. “Stormont has proved incapable of meeting the basic needs of the vast majority of people. Whether its an insulting pay offer for health heroes, doing nothing as people are pushed over a poverty clf edge or ensuring womens rights. “As with the Civil Rights movement of the s, people power will be the key to extending democracy and creating a more equal society.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Sinn Feacutein Councillor was commenting after she and Cllr Conor Heaney met with the Irish Government’s Shared Island Unit. The Shared Island Unit is an initiative that sets out the Irish government’s commitment to working with all communities and traditions on the island to build consensus around a shared future, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. googletag.cmd.push One of its facets is to further develop an all-island economy that includes investing in the North West and border regions. Cllr. Duffy said: “We had a very positive and constructive discussion with the Shared Island Unit which is based in the Taoiseachs Office and has a budget of pound million so it can certainly help progress the discussion that is already well underway across the island regarding Irish reunication. “We briefed them on the key issues facing the north west including Magee expansion, increasing the Irish Government’s contribution to the A, funding for a Derry to Dublin air link as a gateway to the US and the rest of the world and increasing the financial contribution to the existing City Deal to develop a North West Inclusive Growth Fund. “We also updated them on the Working Group on Irish Unity that Sinn Feacutein established within Derry City and Strabane District Council and agreed to share some of the conclusions from the Working Group as it progresses. “What is emerging from that group already is that there is huge potential for Derry and the North West to thrive economically and socially in a reunied Ireland, given that this area perhaps more than most has been stled by the imposition and impact of partition.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times -

Ryanair have confirmed they will operate three weekly flights between Derry and Manchester, England, from Winter . The airline have launched a seat sale to celebrate the announcement of the new route, and their Director of Commercial, Jason McGuinness, said they remain committed to growing their passenger network. googletag.cmd.push Ryanair remains committed to re-building Europe’s aviation and tourism industry by restoring connectivity and growing its network of passengers to over  million by , he said. As Ryanair takes delivery of  additional Boeing - ‘Gamechanger’ aircraft this winter, we are delighted to add this new route from Derry to Manchester. Local MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, welcomed news of the new service. This route has long been an ambition of the airport and I congratulate the airports leadership, and Derry City and Strabane District Council as the owners, for getting this over the line, she said. Connections with Manchester are really important for our local economy, as well as being a key destination for study and social reasons. Manchester is a vibrant and dynamic city, which is becoming increasingly signicant within Britain as an economic hub. Creating business links between the two cities could be extremely beneficial for Derry. The City of Derry Airport provides important economic benefits for Derry, as well as the wider region on both sides of the border. It is essential that the Executive and the British and Irish governments provide the ongoing financial support it needs, not just to survive but to expand.

Ryanair have confirmed they will operate three weekly flights between Derry and Manchester, England, from Winter . The airline have launched a seat sale to celebrate the announcement of the new route, and their Director of Commercial, Jason McGuinness, said they remain committed to growing their passenger network. googletag.cmd.push Ryanair remains committed to re-building Europe’s aviation and tourism industry by restoring connectivity and growing its network of passengers to over  million by , he said. As Ryanair takes delivery of  additional Boeing - ‘Gamechanger’ aircraft this winter, we are delighted to add this new route from Derry to Manchester. Local MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, welcomed news of the new service. This route has long been an ambition of the airport and I congratulate the airports leadership, and Derry City and Strabane District Council as the owners, for getting this over the line, she said. Connections with Manchester are really important for our local economy, as well as being a key destination for study and social reasons. Manchester is a vibrant and dynamic city, which is becoming increasingly signicant within Britain as an economic hub. Creating business links between the two cities could be extremely beneficial for Derry. The City of Derry Airport provides important economic benefits for Derry, as well as the wider region on both sides of the border. It is essential that the Executive and the British and Irish governments provide the ongoing financial support it needs, not just to survive but to expand.

The SDLP leader said that the proposals presented by the Commission this week demonstrate generous flexibility and has called on the British Government to show the same willingness to reach an accommodation. Following the call, Colum Eastwood called on DUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson to withdraw his threat to collapse the devolved institutions in light of the signicant movement made by EU leaders. googletag.cmd.push Colum Eastwood MP said: “We have had further useful dialogue with Maroš Šefčovič this afternoon. The SDLP is very pleased with the flexibility that the European Commission has shown and the proposals that are now on the table. It is time that we see a similar willingness to reach an honourable accommodation from the British Government. “There will now be a period of intense negotiation. That should be a constructive and relentlessly positive engagement aimed at securing a resolution. I hope that the briefing and counter briefing that has characterised previous talks, particularly in the British Press, will not come to define this negotiation. “In the spirit of seeking accommodation, Jeffrey Donaldson should now withdraw his threat to collapse devolved government in Northern Ireland. Unionism has achieved its goals, there is no further price to be extracted. Continuing to make undeliverable demands around the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is a hiding to nothing.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side. After  minutes they were awarded a penalty when Jack Sharvin was fouled in a clumsy challenge from Courtney inside the box.However, Sharvinrsquos spot kick was brilliantly saved by Andy Wallace.Four minutes later and Wallace produced heroics again, this time a save with his feet from Sam Carson after McComiskeyrsquos pace had again exposed Villa.The goal was coming, though, and it was goal of brilliance. Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

With all things considered, officers recommended the delivery of option two.The rural towns officers included in the report are Donaghcloney, Keady, Richhill, Tandragee and Waringstown.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter proposed the officers’ recommendation to go with the festive drive in experience and said “it would be very welcome, especially in those rural communities”.Councillor Paul Berry welcomed the proposal but noted Markethill was not included in the list of towns mentioned and proposed it was included.Council’s head of economic development services, Nicola Wilson confirmed Markethill could be includedcouncillors want.Noting Council has a duty of care to the general public, Councillor Kyle Savage seconded the proposal to accept the recommendation and praised council officersfor “taking and showing true leadership” with this recommendation.Noting he was happy to go with the proposal for the festive drive-in, despite public health regulations relaxing further at the end of October, Councillor Sam Nicholson said he would second Cllr Berry’s proposal to include Markethill in the proposal.“I support Cllr Berry’s call to include Markethill. It is one of our most thriving and vibrant market towns,” he said.“If Councillor Berry is making a proposal to include it, I am happy to second it.”Alderman Ian Burns said he was fully supportive of the proposal but called for the towns of Gilford and Rathfriland to also be recognised.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon said he would prefer to see twilight markets in the rural towns but with the movie night proposal he would want to ensure that “providing it can be worked into costs, it is run in as many of our rural towns as possible”.Alderman Jim Speers said he had discussed this issue “at ” with Council officers and acknowledged the need for as many places as possible to get an event like this.“I am very supportive of the need to have this event in Markethill butwe do that in one place other towns will feel they have been short-changed.“I have already had that conversation with officers and I would like to see us get to the point where this is rolled out across the area.”The committee then voiced its approval for Councillor Baxter’s proposal to recommend the movie night and free Christmas Eve car parking is approved and Cllr Berry’s proposal to incorporate as many smaller towns as budgets will allow.Read this:- Driving tests ‘crisis’Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

Those were outstanding numbers, and we could be looking at even higher rates this time around. However, our vaccination teams time and time again have risen to the challenge when called upon, and this week will be no dferent. “I would encourage everyone and anyone who has not yet received a second dose vaccination to take this opportunity to do so. If you missed your second dose appointment for whatever reason, this is the most accessible way for you to ensure you are fully vaccinated. Just come along to one of our three centres and our staff will be happy to help. “Vaccination is saving lives. When we get jabbed, we are protecting ourselves, protecting others and protecting the health service. It is the single biggest contribution people can make to getting normality back. It helps opens doors to nights out, travel, music and sports events and to so many other things we have missed so much in the last  months.” The Western Trust’s Mass Vaccination Centres will be open to the public as follows this weekend: Venue - SATURDAY OCTOBER  Foyle Arena, Derry Londonderry - .am – .pm Lakeland Forum, Enniskillen - .am – .pm Omagh Leisure Complex - .am – .pm SUNDAY OCTOBER  Foyle Arena, Derry Londonderry - .am – .pm Lakeland Forum, Enniskillen - .am – .pm Omagh Leisure Complex - Closed *PLEASE NOTE* These are second dose clinics ONLY.
