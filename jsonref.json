It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education. It\u0027s entirely up to you.Of course, it is always important to remember when releasing equity that you balance current needs with future wants and you should always think carefully before securing a loan against your home.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghans child free spirited writes OSCAR CAINER","story":"    Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex arrives with Prince Harry, at the Hive, Wirral Youth Zone, as part of a visit to Birkenhead near LiverpoolMeghan\u0027s bodyguard to quit after just six months in the job...Armed and in killer heels, Meghan\u0027s bodyguard: How the Duke...Share this article  I\u0027m having an April baby!

And one man is photographed taking his clothes out of an early spin-dryer which looks technologically just half a step up from a salad spinner.  Elbow grease: These chaps are really putting their backs into the work. Within married couples in the 1940s more women would do the laundry than men, but even bachelors need clean clothes          This forerunner of the modern tumble dryer looks pretty basic by 2019 standards but the basic principle is the same  Smoking Hot: The heat in the steamy laundry was so great some of the washerman stripped to the waist - but just because this was the building for washing and drying clothes, it didn\u0027t stop them sparking up an indoor cigaretteEven the irons are obviously from a bygone era: no inbuilt steam functions or electric cords to be seen, these are irons in every sense of the word, and the men are studiously pressing their work shirts to make sure they are presentable in the days to come.Others can be seen hanging their clothes onto drying racks which then slot into wall lockers to warm and dry the garments.The heat and the steam of the commercial laundry on Endell Street come vividly to life in the 60-year-old photographs, which include one of a man wiping his brow sitting shirtless by a pail.          These drying rails slotted back into wall-mounted cabinets where hot dry air sped up the drying process for the clothes  Fashion of the Forties: neither the trusty cravat, nor trousers so high they sit half way up the ribcage, are common sights in London today. Not even in Shoreditch          When irons were irons: the men heated the solid metal blocks and used the wooden handles to avoid burning themselves          This man looks to be trying to get through his ironing at tremendous speed.

We meet the people whose lives changed after Banksy left his markAfter a Banksy mural appeared on his Port Talbot garage last month, Ian Lewis found himself facing a “very, very stressful” battle to protect the artwork from thieves and vandals. Here, four people share their own, very different experiences of being “Banskied”.David Anslow, property owner: I had a house in Easton, Bristol – where Banksy used to hang out – which I was renting out to students. One day, one of the students phoned up to ask if his “graffiti artist friend” could do some artwork on the side. I thought it would be pretty cool but didn’t think much more about it. Years later, a friend of ours suddenly said, “Did you know you’ve got a Banksy on your house?” He showed me Banksy’s book, Wall and Piece, and there was our house, with a 32-foot mural on it, the full width of the building. It reminded me of Picasso’s Guernica.The crazy thing is that at the time we were trying to sell the house, but couldn’t sell it because of the graffiti. People went, “We love the house, but we’re not buying it with all that stuff on the side.” Then we had this bright idea of selling the Banksy and throwing the house in for free as a publicity stunt for the urban art gallery Red Propeller we were starting.I wanted to make sure any buyer would preserve the mural, but then it all kicked off. The phone started ringing day and night. An Australian offered £400,000. Someone from Los Angeles wanted to take the entire wall to California – the house would have fallen down. When the council sent someone to clean it off, the local people went mad and chased them down the street: we were all very protective of the Banksy. But once the news got round, someone broke into the house, smashed it up and chucked buckets of red paint all over the picture. It was ruined, but then every graffiti artist in Bristol wanted to tag it, so it became this collage of graffiti art, with the remnants of the Banksy still visible.When it all quietened down, the house sold for around its value: £160,000. Part of the reason Banksy goes incognito is because he got into trouble with the council for defacing public property.Sean Cummings, property developer: Banksy visited New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav. Through an intermediary I was asked if he could put something on my warehouse, which is on a prominent boulevard. Obviously, it doesn’t suck that probably the most famous artist in the world today wants to paint your property.It’s rare to find someone so creative with both image and text. I love his quotes, such as “The poet produces poems, the painter produces paintings, the criminal produces crimes. If you can do all three at once, you can really confuse the shit out of them.”I knew Looters was a controversial piece, so we protected it with plexiglass, which failed miserably. Other graffiti artists tagged it, people put placards over it then it almost burned in a fire. Amazingly, a guy from the New Orleans fire department recognised it as a Banksy and protected it from the blaze. By then there were 11 layers of paint, paper and glue on top of the original work. After midnight one night we cut out that whole section of wall, put it on a tractor trailer and hauled it away for restoration. It took nearly four years after the fire to get back to the original paint. Banksy did 17 pieces in New Orleans – this is one of only three that survived. It’s currently in a warehouse, but we want to allow the piece to spread its message, so in March it goes on display at my International House hotel. We’re going to have to dismantle the entrance to get it in. It’s absurd, I know, but very Banksy.Draw the Raised Bridge, Scott Street Bridge, Hull (2018)Jason Fanthorpe, window cleaner: I live two miles from Scott Street bridge and one night one of the local Facebook groups was buzzing with the news that Banksy had painted it. I’m a keen photographer, so got straight down there. It was an ace atmosphere, with busloads of people arriving and taxi drivers bringing people to see it. I had a tingly feeling looking at the mural, and the thought that Banksy had been to Hull and left a political message about Brexit and ision on a disusedraised bridge that separates two halves of the city.Banksy put it on his Instagram, which verified it as genuine, but on the second night my missus was on Facebook and saw that it had been vandalised. It had been intact for two days, which isn’t bad for a Banksy.Social media was full of people ranting and raving, but I wanted to do something about it, so headed down with my ladders. It’s a three by four foot mural, but you need ladders to get up to the top. I was hoping the paint would still be wet, but water wouldn’t touch it. Loads of people were turning up to help, so I did the top on my ladders while a girl rubbed at the bottom. We tried white spirit. I didn’t even think “What if it brings off the Banksy?” which is stupid really, but gradually the picture came up underneath: it was magical.Someone at a local gallery sniffed, “Why don’t they do it on canvas? That’s the place for art”. The council covered it with Perspex, which steams up so you can’t see it, but it’s left a legacy on the city. The Hull Spray Creative asked for permission to turn the whole area into a street art gallery so if you drive around the area now it’s a vibrant mass of ever-evolving graffiti art – because of Banksy.The Grim Reaper, the Thekla, Bristol (2003)The Thekla is such a hub for Bristol’s music and creative community that it’s almost certain Banksy would have come to gigs and parties here. He also had his first Bristol exhibition at the nearby Severnshed bar, so was definitely spending time in the vicinity. There’s always been talk that there were also a couple of his famous rat stencils inside the venue at some point, but they were long gone when I arrived in 2006.Banksy painted the Grim Reaper on the waterside of the moored boat, so the only way he could have done it would have been by sailing out in a rowing boat or something, most likely under cover of darkness. The Reaper is quite large – a couple of metres, and because of its position, it was unlikely to ever be stolen. It wouldn’t just have caused a lot of attention in the harbour, but potentially have sunk the boat! It was probably more hassle than any vandal would be bothered with. But with it being so close to the waterline the big problem was deterioration.When we renovated the Thekla in the dry dock in 2014, we removed the Grim Reaper to preserve and restore the artwork, and came up with the idea of using the original space for other Bristol street artists. Inkie came to mind immediately due to his connections with Banksy and he was happy to come and paint on the boat while it was still out of the water. The Grim Reaper is now free to view in the M-Shed museum.Banksy polarises opinion even in his home city, with some seeing him as a vandal, but they’re probably in the minority these days. The Thekla team are very proud of his success and our artwork. It’s an honour to be Banksied."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a840f693b91fe67d42555b24c6334e9298f4680/251_1497_2178_1306/master/2178.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b53faf9893a9463911277010b64eceb","title":"the scream edvard munch ultimate image political age british museum","story":"Edvard Munch’s painting is a masterpiece for these troubled times. Ahead of an exhibition at the British Museum, Jonathan Jones charts its rise, from the 1893 original to today’s inflatables and emojisThe face is a greenish sock of sickly flesh stretched tight over the skull. Its features have been burned away by pain. All that remain in the elongated mask are two wide round eyes with dots for pupils, a pair of black nostrils and a mouth open in an oval scream. We’ve all been there.The Scream was created by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893 but it has become a masterpiece – the masterpiece – for our time. There are comparably “iconic” works of art – the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s Sunflowers – but they exist in a world of art and beauty. The Scream is ugly and brutal and belongs in the here and now. It is a symbol we reach for as we might for a strong word, to express what we’re feeling this minute.The cartoonist Peter Brookes called on it to sum up what so many were feeling when Donald J Trump was elected president of the United States. In Brookes’s depiction of Trump’s inauguration, every single person in the crowd has metamorphosed into the wraith-like figure from The Scream. They sway in unison, hands to their hollowed faces, clad in black smocks.You don’t have to be a professional cartoonist to express yourself with The Scream – you just need to text. The emoji sign “face screaming in fear” neatly sums up Munch’s image as a yellow face turning blue as it opens its mouth to scream, with eyes wide open, hands pressed to its cheeks in shock. It’s a handy emoji if you’re traumatised by Brexit … or climate change, or plastic in the oceans, or emojis.There are plenty of reasons to scream, says Hugo Chapman, the keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum. “Is that not the feeling of our time?” he asks of Munch’s image. Chapman’s department is usually where scholars fill out forms to study Rubens drawings or old maps of Somerset, but its announcement of a new exhibition has sent headlines spinning simply because Edvard Munch: Love and Angst, which opens in April, will include the 1895 lithographic version of The Scream. Chapman says the museum has not been surprised by the shrieks of excitement. “We have hit at a time of maximum anxiety that all of us feel incredibly strongly,” he told me on the eve of the meaningful vote in the House of Commons on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.It is also a time of sardonic laughter, and surely part of the resonance of The Scream in these strange times is its comic hyperbole. A huge part of the global population was transfixed in the silent pose of Munch’s screamer on Trump’s inauguration day – and we still are – but there is also a blackly comic release in recognising our plight in this late-Romantic image. In fact, many appropriations of The Scream by popular culture are a howl. A chain of self-consciously youthful and riotous pubs called It’s A Scream used Munch’s painting as an advert for booze and bad behaviour. An artist called Robert Fishbone found a new sideline when he created an inflatable version of The Scream that became a must-have novelty for art students and existentialists everywhere. And in Wes Craven’s 1996 film Scream, which is at once a satire on slasher horror movies and a highly effective resurrection of the genre, the killer wears a white Halloween mask version of Munch’s screaming face. It is both ridiculous and gruesome.These examples of The Scream’s irresistible rise in the shattered modern mind originated in the 1990s, which seems to have been the decade that saw Munch’s picture start its final ascent from a famous masterpiece of modern art to the most recognised, quoted and gazed-at icon of all. As a matter of fact, its triumph can be dated exactly. Today’s cult of The Scream started 25 years ago, on 12 February 1994. That was when thieves stole the original 1893 painting from Norway’s National Gallery. Detective Charles Hill, who was sent to Oslo from Scotland Yard’s specialist art squad to help get it back, remembers that it was not a very impressive heist: “It was two men and a ladder.” Detectives got in touch with the criminals and, astonishingly, convinced them that California’s Getty Museum was prepared to buy this piece of toxic contraband.“I appeared as the man from the Getty,” says Hill. He negotiated with the crooks, refusing an offer to go somewhere unspecified with them, purportedly to see it, by dead of night, and ultimately helping to secure it just three months after it was stolen. Art crime may be ugly, but it is also popular recognition of a kind. You know you’ve made it when the criminal community rates your works theft-worthy. Although the Mona Lisa was always renowned, its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and recovery two years later catapulted it from genteel totem to pop icon. The theft of The Scream had a similar electrifying effect. It even started a gangland fashion. In 2004, masked gunmen seized Munch’s second painted version of The Scream, which dates from 1910, from the Munch Museum in Oslo. This time it took longer to get back, and suffered some nasty damage.The 1990s also saw The Scream mirror a wider cultural mood. The end of the brash yuppy era brought a new emotional openness. Munch’s fin-de-siècle masterpiece suited another fin de siècle a century after its creation. Contemporary artists were returning to his themes of inner darkness with installations that used thick black crude oil, preserved animal bodies or a cast of a house. One Young British Artist, Tracey Emin, was consciously inspired by Munch in her confessional work My Bed, which is a kind of scream expressed through full ashtrays and empty bottles. Emin is now working on a seven-metre nude statue in homage to Munch that has been commissioned for the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour, due to open next year.If The Scream spoke in a new key to the late 20th century, the anxieties of this century, which started on 11 September 2001, have made it seem the most contemporary of all masterpieces. Its translation into an emoji is truly significant. The Scream emoji makes explicit the striking fact that it is getting hard to say the word “scream” without seeing The Scream. This painting is becoming part of the language. The Scream has become part of a shift to reconnect idea and images, to express ourselves in the internet age by direct visual icons. It is not just a painting that makes a good emoji. It is the original emoji.To see the revolutionary nature of Munch’s achievement, you only have to see how he first rendered into art the experience that The Scream records. In 1892, he painted Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. It shows a man leaning on the wooden railing of a bridge, looking out on to a darkling blot of a fjord beneath a yellow sky smeared with red clouds of apocalyptic fire. Two other figures parade the boardwalk, leaving him to his depressed thoughts. The railings and walkway rushing away in steep perspective to the left of the scene, the paranoia-inducing figures walking away, the curve of the fjord – this is unmistakably the landscape of The Scream. For both paintings depict a real experience, a transforming, unforgettable moment of revelation. Was it an artistic ecstasy, like the visions of Romantic poets including Blake and Coleridge, or an episode of mental illness? In 1908, Munch wrote it down. He tells of how he was walking with two friends near Kristiania – as Oslo was then called – when the sun went down over the fjord. At the time, he writes, “life had ripped open my soul”.Born in Ådalsbruk in 1863, Munch grew up in Kristiania amid poverty, puritanism and illness. One of his first paintings, The Sick Child, is a memory of seeing his sister die. As a young artist, he had to struggle with frequent illnesses, rejection, alcoholism and a tempestuous relationship in which he got shot. He was also witness to a murderous love affair among his bohemian friends. So as he looked at the sunset that evening, the sky split open not just in clouds of red but a bloody, volcanic, atomic rupture in the fabric of reality itself: “Then it seemed as if a flaming sword of blood slashed through the heavens’ vault – The air became like blood – with piercing strands of fire – The fjord – glared in cold blue – yellow and red colours – bloody red screeched – on the road – and on the railing – My friends’ faces turned glaring yellow-white … ”This is the moment he depicts in Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. In this painting, we see his anguish from the outside. The sky is gory, but it is in the closed mind of the man brooding with his face turned away from us that it feels like the end of the world. We see his despair, but it is not ours. We are like the audience watching Hamlet: involved yet outside his tragedy.The following year, Munch obliterated that gap between actor and audience, artwork and onlooker. In 1893, he created his first two versions of The Scream. The one that is in Oslo’s National Gallery is done with tempera, that is, egg-based paints and crayon on cardboard. The other, in crayon alone, also on cardboard, belongs to the Munch Museum. In both of them, he simplifies his vision of the nightmare sunset into bands and nodules of colour, almost like the flow of woodgrain. More radically, he replaces his brooding man with a figure who has no identifiable sex and may even be a ghost or ghoul. Clad in a dark dress or tight robe, its face reduced to that caricature of dread beyond words, the screamer does not look at the mad sky but directly at us. It is us.By removing all iniduality from this being, Munch allows anyone to inhabit it. He draws a glove puppet for the soul. Absurd and empty, it is filled by the scream its mouth shapes – and that scream, claimed Munch, comes from the landscape itself. He testified that he truly heard a scream pierce the sky and fjord as he gazed on the terrible fiery sunset: “I felt a great scream – and I actually heard a great scream – The colours of nature broke up – the lines of nature – the lines and the colours – quivered in motion – These oscillations of light not only caused my eye to vibrate – they also brought my ear into vibration – so that I truly heard a scream – I then painted the picture Scream.”In Norwegian it is “skrik”, whose jarring note sounds more like the English “shriek” than “scream”. The resemblance is no coincidence but clearly reflects the Viking infuence on our language. So Munch felt nature shriek. The imagery he uses is telling: as he watched, the light seemed to shake, the colours of nature to warp before or, rather, within his eyes. As his visual sense shook, it set off something in his ears. This is an instance of synesthesia, when experiences ramify through more than one of our senses. Munch was undergoing the kind of hallucinatory, multi-sensory, almost out-of-body adventure associated with visionary episodes from shamanism to psychedelia. It was part of a dangerous descent to the edge of madness that would eventually lead to him being hospitalised. And in The Scream, by creating a figure anyone can identify with, a pure embodiment of feeling, he lets us enter that same extreme state.The Scream is so much more than a receptacle for the anxiety we’re feeling right now. It can rescue us. It offers a means of release from the grind and banality of politics, money and work. The true purpose of the greatest modern art is to reconnect us with demonic, ecstatic experiences that defy the boredom of modern industrial capitalism. Maybe Munch was possessed by the Vikings when he heard the world scream. For The Scream seems pagan and primitive in its shudder at the iciness of the empty north. It is a painting of Ragnarök – the Norse apocalypse. Which makes it even more the masterpiece for our time. Play Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song and stare at The Scream.

The past, imagined and real, offers fascinating answersIf this sounds familiar even to those of us who are not historians of British economic policy in the 1950s, it’s because it is the vision for Brexit that was advertised 60 years later. Plan G, as it was known in 1956, is now Plan A for the true believers: we can have all the benefits of being in the EU without the burdens and compromises of actual membership. And the other Europeans will be so glad that we have condescended to deal with them that we can dictate our own terms.It didn’t work in 1956, not least because, as Kevin O’Rourke states in his crisp, clear and quietly devastating history, “UK policymakers had been focused on what was required in order to achieve a domestic consensus in Britain. Not surprisingly, they had produced a blueprint that was indeed a very good deal for Britain – but in so doing they had paid insufficient attention to other countries’ interests.” And of course it has not worked since 2016 for precisely the same reasons. Here, as in so much else, we see that if Brexit has a history, it is not a linear one – it loops back not just to an imagined past but to assumptions about Britain’s place in the world that were untenable even in the 1950s.O’Rourke is all too aware that, as titles go, A Short History of Brexit is problematic. For one thing, as the defeat of the withdrawal agreement has confirmed, this tale, however it turns out, will not be short. For another, the story is rapidly unfolding: the proofs of the book sent out to reviewers had empty space at the end for last-minute updates – the finished book takes events up to Christmas. It might indeed be questioned whether such a project is worth doing while the outcome is so uncertain. But O’Rourke’s book provides a bracing and absorbing answer. As he puts it towards the end, Brexit has already been “a hugely informative, if costly, civics lesson for the people of Britain, Ireland, and the rest of Europe” and he is superbly well fitted to draw out that lesson for the general reader.Kevin Hjortshøj O’Rourke, to give him his full name, has been Chichele professor of economic history at Oxford since 2011. His father was Ireland’s permanent representative to the EU in the 1980s, his mother is Danish, he was born in Switzerland and is a municipal councillor in the small French village of Saint-Pierre-d’Entremont. This mixture of expertise and life experience gives him both a sure grasp of the fine details and a wider human perspective.He is excellent on the realities of trade regimes: if you want the truth about what World Trade Organisation rules actually mean, or why hard borders cannot be avoided even if post-Brexit Britain merely ends up with different rules on VAT, he is a reliable guide. Some of these “civics lesson” aspects of O’Rourke’s book have an urgency that is shaped by the sheer mendacity of the Brexiters. It should not, for example, be a great revelation that freedom of movement isn’t a cunning trap devised after an innocent Britain had been lured into what it thought was merely a trading bloc: it is right there in the 1957 treaty of Rome. Yet it matters that such things are laid out with such clarity.O’Rourke is also acute on the very different ways in which first world war centenaries were commemorated in Britain and France. One memo to David Cameron as prime minister issued instructions that “we must ensure that our commemoration does not give any support to the myth that European integration was the result of the two World Wars”. By contrast, the French prime minister Édouard Philippe, speaking in 2017 at the armistice site at Compiègne, did exactly that, evoking the idea of “a Europe that reminds us of the eternal values that unite us, and the disasters we mourn”.While O’Rourke’s cool account of the Brexit negotiations is valuable, it is his overview that is most important. He explains why the habit of setting the claims of Europe against those of the nation state is simply wrong. The European Union was the answer to a very real and urgent question: how can we enjoy the economic benefits of free trade while limiting the known ability of free trade to undermine national governments and the welfare states they had put in place? The dilemma, as he so neatly summarises it, is that “economic prosperity required trade but political stability required welfare states. In order to achieve both prosperity and stability a free trade area was not enough: you needed European integration to set a common regulatory framework so as to prevent destructive races to the bottom. In this way Europe would come to the rescue of the European nation state.”Perhaps this thought might be taken a little further: if the EU was about rescuing the nation state, might the great structural problem of Britain’s attitudes to it be precisely that the UK is not a nation state? It was, in the early days of European postwar unification, still an imperial power, and its official suspicion of the idea of a continental customs union was shaped by the belief that it could and should continue to prioritise its trade with its soon-to-be-former colonies. (The excruciating contradictions that this involved are perfectly captured by the conclusion of a British expert committee appointed in 1947: “A continental customs union had little economically in its favour other than the damage which would be caused by being excluded from it.”) And of course, the UK contains four different nations that would come over time to take very different views both of the nature of the welfare state and of the relevance of Europe to their sense of identity.The great limitation of historians is generally that they know too much. They cannot share the great ignorance of the people they are writing about: the condition, in which we are all still held after the stalemate at Westminster, of not knowing how it is all going to turn out. Though it is scant consolation for the pain it inflicts, Brexit does rather poignantly bring together the knowledge provided by a long-term historical perspective with the sheer terrifying unknowability of the outcome. O’Rourke may not have known the result of the vote on the withdrawal agreement, but his guess turns out to be a well-educated one. He predicts, accurately, that alongside that deal, “the only logical alternatives would appear to be no deal and no Brexit”. And he points to a hard fact that some of those suggesting other plans at this very late stage seem not to grasp: “The Labour party hopes that a general election might in such circumstances return it to power, but even if that happened the country would still face the same three alternatives the ‘Norway plus’ option requires leaving on the basis of the existing Withdrawal Agreement.” As O’Rourke acknowledges: “This is what history feels like when it is being made.” It feels simultaneously like reliving the past and forgetting everything that might have been learned from it.• A Short History of Brexit: A Pelican Book by Kevin O’Rourke is published by Pelican (RRP £20).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.granitadicaffe has just “entered the gates of Purgatory” with Dante:In Il Purgatorio it takes 9 cantos before you reach Purgatory itself. On the way they meet and chat to various historical personages. The gates are a little hard to find and when you get there there are 3 large steps of marble outside: the first is white, smooth and polished, the second dark rough and cracked, and the third red like blood spurting from a vein. On these stands a big angel with a sword, who only opened the door after Virgil explained their mission. He used 2 keys, a silver and a gold one. If the latter, which is difficult to turn, won’t open then you can’t get in. It is hard to enter Purgatory but once you are inside you mustn’t look back!“I’m not a slow reader,” says kinson1964, but “I’ve been reading the same book since last year.” That book is Jerusalem by Alan Moore:A huge book (page numbers reach four figures) and it’s an amazing read. It deals with Northampton rather like Joyce deals with Dublin or Gray does with Glasgow - all human life (and death) is there together with a wealth of historical facts, trivia and metaphysical speculation. I now wish that I knew the town well for the extra psycho-geographical resonance.A Delicate Truth, “another le Carré novel leaving barbs deep in the body politic of the high and mighty of Britain”, has captivated notatalllover:Unputdownable, Toby Bell, the hero, showing the meaning of bouncebackability, having grabbed hold of the hand of someone under the cosh of the secret state faces brutal consequences in his desire to find the truth behind the lies and cover up hidden under the pacific blanket wielded by the Foreign Office. Again le Carré lets his readers know Britain is a police state in all but name. A rewarding read.A quick tip from Dennis89:Just finished Night Flight by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. A short novella and the ideal read for one sitting.... Beautiful prose and quite atmospheric for such a short book.And a fine idea from nkenny:I’ve been listening to the audiobook of Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson. It’s extremely funny and perfect for dipping in and out of during spare moments.Van Gogh’s letters have impressed marosc:They’re really good. The main element of his personality that’s coming out is commitment to authenticity - he’s determined to be himself even in the face of severe family pressure to conform and to be true to his artistic vision even when it means only selling a handful of pieces because he refuses to compromise to make his art more saleable. And his brother Theo must be the greatest art benefactor in history - pretty much single handedly supporting Vincent so he can dedicate himself to art - and what a legacy we’ve got because of that. The way Vincent writes about his art and comparing it with other artists (it’s not true that he was a loner - he was friends with Toulouse-Lautrec \u0026amp Seurat and, of course, began a failed attempt at an artists’ community with Gauguin) is totally engaging - you can really feel his excitement about what he’s doing.Emily Wilson’s translation of Homer’s Odyssey is, according to FrogC, “excellent”:It was not at all what I expected. The voyaging adventures are mostly told in flashback and take up a smaller part of the book than Odysseus’s return home and revenge upon the suitors who’ve been pestering his wife and eating him out of house and home. (I kept thinking, impertinently, that that was not how I would have written it.) And it’s a surprisingly cruel book - I ended up not liking Odysseus very much.Finally, Tom Mooney recommends A Different Drummer by William Melvin Kelley:In 1957, a young black farmer shoots his livestock, salts his fields and burns down his house. He then walks away from his fictional southern state. Every other black citizen follows his lead.From this brilliant set-up, Kelley tells the story of young Tucker Caliban, his ancestors and their masters, owners and bosses, entirely through the eyes of the white people left behind in town.There are a lot of moving parts in this novel but they tie together beautifully come the end. It’s at times hopeful and cynical, moral and immoral, simple and complex. Almost 60 years after it was first published it feels incredibly fresh and would sit happily alongside the works of Ellison, Baldwin and other great writers on civil rights in the US.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

However, it was still unclear how costly it would be to cover deferred awards which Orcel had racked up at UBS over seven years. understands that it would have meant paying upwards of €50m (£44.8m). Santander declined to comment on the figure. Negotiations eventually broke down and the lender said Orcel’s signing-on fee ultimately proved “unacceptable”.Santander said: “In recent months, discussions have been taking place over the terms of Orcel’s departure from his previous employer.“It has now become clear that the cost to Santander of compensating Mr Orcel for the deferred awards he has earned over the past seven years, and other benefits previously awarded to him, would be a sum significantly above the board’s original expectations at the time of the appointment.“The board considers that for Santander to pay this amount to facilitating the hiring of one inidual, even one of the calibre and background of Mr Orcel, would be unacceptable for a retail and commercial bank such as Santander.”It means Santander’s current chief executive, José Antonio Alvarez, would continue in the role, abandoning plans to transition to the chairman of Santander Spain in March.Orcel, known as a star investment banker at UBS, was set to pocket an annual pay package “in line” with Alvarez, who earned €8.9m (£8m) in 2017.Santander’s executive chair Ana Botín, commenting on the group’s decision, said: “In making this decision we have had to balance the respect we have for all of our stakeholders ‐ the millions of people, customers and shareholders we serve ‐ with the very significant cost of hiring one inidual, even one as talented as Andrea, by compensating for the loss of a significant proportion of seven years of his past remuneration.“The board and I are certain that this decision, although difficult to take, is the right one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692af02e87a234fc03630038196909eaed579d32/0_255_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1324fa6e921dcf40eb75fa254c37318","title":"paperchase considers closing stores amid high street struggles","story":"Cards and stationery retailer mulls restructuring options as HMV struggles to find a buyerThe cards and stationery retailer Paperchase is considering closing stores via an insolvency procedure, as administrators to HMV struggle to line up buyers.Paperchase, which has 130 sites in the UK, has appointed KPMG to advise on restructuring options as shoppers have veered away from the high street over Christmas and cut back on non-essentials.One likely option would be a company voluntary arrangement, an insolvency procedure that has been used by other retailers, including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare, to reduce their high street estate.The company, which was bought by the private equity firm Primary Capital in 2010, blamed a decline in shopper numbers and rising costs, particularly rates and rent.The problems at Paperchase have emerged as administrators for HMV are understood to be considering up to eight proposals from interested parties believed to include Elliott Advisors, which bought the Waterstones bookstore chain last year.A North American music retailer is also said to have expressed an interest in some HMV sites. One source said this could be Sunrise Records, which took over about 70 HMV stores in Canada after the chain went bust there in 2017.Hopes of a rescue of the entire chain are slim amid the uncertainty around Brexit, falling DVD sales and heavy competition from Amazon and the supermarkets.However, several music industry experts said music labels and film companies would be reluctant to see the last major high street home entertainment chain disappear, handing more power to Amazon.High streets are struggling amid a switch to online shopping and rises in business rates and the legal minimum wage, which have added to costs just as shoppers rein in spending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12e485406caf7006b2ceff825db6dd762b4de978/273_858_2134_1279/master/2134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb24babe055aa31937e0299bc1f6aefc","title":"reckitt benckiser chief rakesh kapoor to step down","story":"CEO to exit after eight-year tenure in top job dogged by pay criticism as share price slumpedRakesh Kapoor, the £100m boss of the firm behind brands from Dettol to Durex, is to leave the company after a troubled couple of years blighted by a cyber-attack, criticism over his pay and factory disruption.Reckitt Benckiser said Kapoor would retire as chief executive by the end of 2019, after 32 years at the consumer goods firm and eight in the top job.Kapoor was expected to leave the company having earned more than £100m during his chief tenure. His pay package between 2011 and 2017 totalled nearly £86m, while his 2018 salary was yet to be disclosed.Shares increased from about £32 at the time of his appointment to a high of £80 in July 2017, but they have since fallen to £60.Kapoor’s pay was cut by £11m to £12.5m for 2017, after a sharp fall in the share price and conversations with Reckitt Benckiser shareholders, some of whom had expressed concern that the company’s pay policy permitted excessive payouts.His predecessor, Bart Becht, came under fire in 2010 over a pay packet worth more than £90m.Kapoor’s announced departure came after a string of problems at the company which also makes brands including Nurofen, Veet and Vanish. In 2016, Reckitt paid £300m to the relatives of people who had suffered illness and fatal lung injuries linked to humidifier sterilisers sold in South Korea by the firm.The company suffered a cyber-attack in 2017, and sales were hit last year after manufacturing problems at a Dutch factory that makes baby formula.Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said: “News that Rakesh Kapoor is to stand down as chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser shouldn’t come as a surprise given how the business has floundered over the past year or two.“Kapoor’s early days as chief executive were successful with shareholders rewarded with a decent uptick in the share price. But the shares have had a much harder time since summer 2017.”Chris Sinclair, the chair of Reckitt Benckiser, said the search was now underway for a new chief executive, with both internal and external candidates to be considered.He said: “Under Rakesh’s leadership, RB has been transformed from a household cleaning business to a world leader in consumer health and hygiene.

So why aren’t more farmers opting for this alternative?It’s a loss that has been driven by the intensification of farming to produce our food, fuelled by an increased use of pesticides and fertilisers to keep weeds and pests at bay and help crops grow. This is bad news for wildlife, as it not only takes away potential food sources for birds, mammals and other animals, but can also poison them and contaminate local watercourses. Marginal habitats, such as ponds and hedgerows, have also been lost in the drive to grow more food.This boost in wildlife is a result of organic practices, including growing a greater variety and rotation of crops, having bigger and more erse hedgerows, and avoiding the use of pesticides to protect crops from weeds, insects and diseases. This means organic farms are home to more insects, weeds and other plants that can then, for example, feed birds through the winter months.For organic farmers, it’s about farming with as much wildlife as is manageable. “I like to think of my land as open to wildlife rather than abandoning it,” says Guy Singh-Watson, farmer and founder of the organic delivery business Riverford.They also cannot rely on supermarkets to take their produce – their avoidance of pest-controlling chemicals means they have to deal with more variability in terms of quality. The carrots produced by Patrick Holden, the former head of organic trade body the Soil Association, were infamously rejected by his supermarket buyer over quality issues. “Supermarkets are preaching localism but it’s just tokenism. Their systems are still going in the opposite direction, and it’s disastrous,” he says.Singh-Watson’s organic farm, in south Devon, survives through his UK-wide vegetable box scheme. “It’s very difficult if you are supplying a supermarket. A lot of pesticides are used quite unnecessarily, because the farmer cannot afford to have their crop rejected by buyers.”Plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to fight back against pest attacks, so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays, say researchers.The study, completed in 2014, also found that pesticide residues were four times more likely to be found in conventional crops than organic ones.The study’s conclusions have been questioned by other academics, who said there were not enough high-quality studies to support the conclusion that organic food was nutritionally different to conventionally produced food. A review by the UK food standards agency in 2009 found that organic food provides no significant health benefits over conventionally produced food.But Leifert has called for more research on the issue. “We have shown, without doubt, that there are composition differences between organic and conventional crops. Now there is an urgent need to carry out well-controlled human dietary intervention and quantify the health impacts of switching to organic food.”Want to eat more ethically?

Walkers stroll along the concrete promenades, and mothers enjoy a moment of respite under newly planted saplings while their children play in the adjoining gardens.Few Ahmedabad residents could have imagined this scene a couple of decades ago. Back then the Gujarati city’s tidal river banks were lined with slum housing – precariously constructed on land polluted by industrial effluent and untreated sewage, and home to some of the most marginalised communities in the city.Over the coming years this central location will transform yet further. Retaining walls have been built on both sides to narrow the river to stop it from flooding low-lying developments and eroding the riverbank, in a project likened to Joseph Bazalgette’s embankments along the Thames in London, or those along the Seine in Paris and Hudson in New York. The newly created land will be home to shopping malls, luxury hotels, floating restaurants, museums and sprawling parks.By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.“The worst part of the city, with flowing gutters and illegal constructions, has been converted into an iconic infrastructure project,” says Vijay Nehra, the commissioner of Ahmedabad, whose municipal corporation has spent more than 15bn rupees (£170m) on the scheme.The riverfront redevelopment model is being copied by several other Indian cities, from New Delhi to Mumbai, but as Ahmedabad’s population nears 10 million, not everyone is happy with the changes taking place – least of all the slum dwellers who have been relocated away from the city centre, the upstream farmers worried about their water supply and the environmentalists concerned the Sabarmati remains one of the country’s 15 most polluted rivers.The idea of a public riverfront was first proposed in the 1960s by the French architect Bernard Kohn, who was living in Ahmedabad at the time, as part of a vision for an ecological valley. Lack of funds meant it was shelved for the next 30 years.It was given new life in a different form in the mid-90s when the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) took charge of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. (The BJP’s Narendra Modi, a local politician, is now India’s prime minister.) Bimal Patel – son of the late Hasmukh Patel, an influential architect whose buildings dot the city’s skyline – and his HCP Design and Project Management firm were hired to draw up a masterplan.But before the first concrete could be poured, the tens of thousands of people who called the area home, many for three generations or more, had to be removed. The riverbed had become a dumping ground for the city’s waste and the area was rampant with disease, while floods frequently led to deaths and the destruction of dwellings. The clothes washers and small-scale farmers were dependent on the river directly, while others such as domestic workers and ragpickers relied on its central location.Government surveys conducted before the construction began in 2005 identified 11,000 families who would be displaced – although activists believe the actual number was three times higher.The Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation spent some 11bn rupees (£124m) building new housing for those who would lose their homes, but Beena Jadhav, director of the Ahmedabad-based housing rights NGO Rahethan Adhikar Manch, says the process was mismanaged.“Not a single family walked from their houses by the river to the ones given by the government without a phase of being homeless,” she says. “There were many demolitions without an eviction notice.”Even those who left voluntarily found themselves unable to get work in the new location. Noorja Abdullah Pathan, 56, says: “The new government home felt like a private bungalow compared to where I lived before but I cannot find any work here. I can’t afford to travel for it either. I am always begging for food or dying of hunger. At least by the river I survived.”It is not just the development’s effect on the riverbank that is controversial – its effect on the water is too.The project has seen the tidal river, which was 679 metres across at its widest, narrowed to a regular 329 metres. “Pinching the river for a uniform width and building embankments have lowered the Sabarmati’s flood-carrying capacity,” says Mahesh Pandya, the founder of Paryavaran Mitra, an observer organisation for the UN Framework Convention On Climate Change. “This was always a project just for beautification. No environmental assessment has been done.”Meanwhile, activists are worried that the water supply for farmers in drought-prone parts of Gujarat will be affected by the project. Water from the Narmada canal – a multipurpose dam project that irrigates more than 3,000 villages across the state – was used as part of the scheme, and levels of the dam have since been recorded at their lowest in 13 years. The state government has vowed to stop the city from using the Narmada’s water free of charge, and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation insists new treatment plants will prevent any untreated sewage from entering the river within three years.Patel, though, considers his project to be on track. “With these homes along the river there was no way for the residents of Ahmedabad to access the waterfront,” he says. “The key objectives have always been to create a public realm along the river, clean the water and rehabilitate those affected by the project. Now a huge public space is available for 7 million people.”But he cautions that the development is a long-term project. “The problems Indian cities face today are the challenges their European counterparts faced in the 19th century,” he says. “Their solutions, like controlling tidal rivers with embankments, remain the same.“It took over 70 years to clean the Thames. I am not saying it will take that long for the Sabarmati, but developing a riverfront is a three-generation project.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/894797e5ba8e3620e03c7ac0ab8add34d60437c1/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07ce3e87ed8b74d9b9f3f83415b3ab1d","title":"democracies trust political faith religion","story":"If you wanted to lose an English audience, it would be hard to find a more effective way than to tell them that religion is important to democracy. For a substantial minority, religion is simply a toxic phenomenon whose malign effects range from sexual repression to suicide bombers without ever straying into kindness or compassion. In our secularised times, a majority believe it can’t possibly have any use or relevance in the modern world.By extension, anyone who thinks debate about religion really matters is liable to be considered a bit of a weirdo. That is why campaigns against the bishops in the House of Lords have scarcely any more traction than campaigns in their favour.But both sides are wrong. Religion does supply some nutrients that democracies need to survive. I came to this conclusion while listening to Charlotte Knobloch, who survived the Holocaust as a child hidden on a farm in rural Bavaria, and is now the leader of the Bavarian Jewish community. She was talking at a conference in Cumberland Lodge, in Windsor Park, on moral and spiritual defences of democracy: this is a woman with a very German, serious attitude towards ideas – and three large bodyguards, to remind us what some ideas can lead to.She quoted a supreme court judge who had written at the height of the Baader Meinhof terror attacks in the 1970s that liberal, secular democracy arises from conditions that it cannot itself guarantee. This is a profound and disturbing remark that undermines all the confidence of westernising globalists who believe our values will naturally spread across the world as soon as people realise they can choose them.In particular, she said, liberal, secular democracy depends on trust. People need to trust the institutions of the state, the political class needs to trust the people, the media have to be both trusted and trustworthy, and people need to trust each other. All these forms of trust have been eroding in this century, and populist movements of all kinds are both a product of this erosion and a further cause of it.The thugs chanting “Liar!” and “Nazi!” at Anna Soubry are both expressing their own alienation from the political order and encouraging it in others.The problem thus becomes one of restoring trust on all levels. The difficulty is that we don’t know how to do this for institutions. We maintain and restore trust by being ourselves trustworthy and punishing those who are not. This is possible, though hard enough, on a personal level. But society is made up not just of personal interactions. It operates through institutions – and when they are broken and untrustworthy, they are even harder to fix. How does an institution repent convincingly? The example of the Catholic church with child abuse shows how hard this is for an institution that has forfeited trust. How can we convincingly punish the representatives who fail and betray our trust? In this country we generally end up giving them seats in the House of Lords.Religion, despite its chequered and sometimes shameful record, can at least give us something to think about here. Because religions attribute to our actions a significance beyond the calculation of inidual advantage and consequence.Something that works like religious faith is the only way to establish the kind of structures of trust and the links between personal and collective morality that democracies need if they are to work. Knobloch said religions offered continuity and community, and these are other aspects of the same fundamental linkage. Only by imagining – in the teeth of much evidence – that all of us deserve to be judged impartially and fairly, and in some sense ultimately, will be – can we – move towards a society where this is almost true.Of course religions are irrational. But so are all forms of social organisation. The only perfectly rational calculator of their own interests is a sociopath – and the sociopath is unable to calculate the best interests of anyone who is not a sociopath. Civilisation depends on people following rules that they cannot entirely understand or justify quite as much as it needs people to question them.Rational self-interest will not do the trick. That is what gave us the present crisis. The cure can only be faith in something better than the calculation of advantage, whether this is Christianity or the American constitution. It hardly matters which: what matters is the structure of shared practice and belief which gives a shared moral significance to our actions, so that both rulers and ruled are judged by the same laws. And in Donald Trump’s case, this should ultimately be the criminal law.• Andrew Brown is a  writer and an author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1e9bdf8ad97c99a275ba04366c71fc18ec0b9d/0_16_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d2393363dff1d8bd35d3be5bb715450","title":"freedom movement euroep foreign posted workers eu","story":"Freedom of movement for EU workers has been front and centre in the Brexit debate. Fear of foreign workers undercutting the wages and working conditions of locals helped to fuel the leave campaign. Now EU nationals – Poles and others – who have called Britain home for years, sometimes decades, face an uncertain future in the UK.But while attitudes to migrant workers in Brexit Britain are often seen as a case apart, free movement of people evokes hostility in other EU countries too. The belief that foreigners take away jobs from local workers is – and has long been – a textbook example of false information. Research has proved again and again that the belief is ill-founded. Yet to some, it feels true no matter how many studies show that it is not.The Dutch Freedom party, for example, created a website a few years ago where Dutch citizens could report suspected undercutting in the labour market by workers from Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. The problem of unfair competition and “social dumping” also loomed large in the most recent French presidential election, with accusations of Polish workers bypassing French labour market regulation. Brexit is not a standalone manifestation of a malaise – it is simply the most extreme.Much of the problem relates to inadequate EU labour market legislation and – ironically, given the discourse – the negative consequences are experienced mostly by the workers who move about themselves. Especially troubling is the exploitation of “posted workers”, employees from one EU state who are temporarily seconded by their employer (sometimes based in a third EU country) to carry out a service elsewhere in the EU, while remaining tied to the social security system of their country of origin. Out-of-date EU regulation has allowed the consistent undercutting of wages and working conditions, and the exploitation of these foreign nationals.While this form of labour mobility and its problems is well known in expert circles, it has not received the attention it deserves owing to its complicated and often opaque nature. EU rules on posted workers were originally intended to strengthen the rights of EU citizens moving from one member state to another. The assumption was that highly skilled workers would provide short-term expertise where it was needed. After the service wascompleted, the workers would return to their permanent employment relationship in their country of origin.But European labour markets today look radically different from when this legislation emerged in the 1990s. Large parts of the population are in temporary, short-term and insecure employment contracts. Moreover, the 28 member states now have radically different welfare states and wage levels.As I have detailed in my recent book, Workers Without Borders, there are several reasons why it is easier for employers to exploit posted workers than even temporary agency workers. For a start they are sent abroad for a limited period and are not automatically entitled to equal treatment with nationals. They feel detached from the country and the trade unions where the job is carried out, and will seek to claim their rights only in the most dire cases. Because of the temporary nature of the work, they often endure mistreatment in order to earn a target wage before moving on to another employment opportunity. Third, labour inspection in the UK, as in other EU countries, cannot adequately enforce the rights of posted workers because subcontractors posting workers abroad can easily de- and re-register from one country to the next.Though these workers are performing vital tasks in fields such as construction, nursing and transport, they do not enjoy the same rights and benefits as others doing the same jobs. At the same time, they face hostility owing to their willingness to work for lower wages and with fewer social rights, primarily along east-west and south-north axes, sincewages are higher in northern and western Europe. One of the biggest receiving countries is Germany, where foreign workers are especially in demand in the construction industry.In the course of my research I conducted more than 100 interviews with such workers and found that they were particularly vulnerable to exploitation, even in advanced industrial economies with strong employment protection. For instance, a posted Polish construction worker on a German building site does not enjoy the same rights as German or even Polish colleagues working for a German subcontractor, because the employment relationship is partially regulated from Poland.Thus, popular, derogatory stereotypes of the “Polish plumber” might well have emerged not because of inidual tradespeople offering cheaper services but because EU regulation does not adequately protect EU citizens who move for work to another country.My research shows that, in today’s economy, many posted workers are forced to accept just about any job, with no permanent employment do not get their minimum rights enforced in the host state and are afraid to voice their rights in fear of employer retaliation and unemployment. This is a particularly distressing paradox in the modern European welfare states: how can a country like Germany, with such powerful employers’ associations and trade unions, allow for a precarious labour market segment composed of EU migrants?An overlooked piece of the puzzle is the re-regulatory politics at the workplace level. The debate around Brexit and the rise of nationalism in the EU is closely connected to populist discourse about, unsurprisingly, broad movements and vague numbers of workers. Yet the lived experiences of inidual EU citizens who make use of freedom of movement should allow a more nuanced picture of the internal market and its labour market rules – and who knows, a little more sympathy and understanding.Political isions among EU states over posted workers break along the aforementioned east-west axis. Eastern European states lobby for deregulation, while western states support stricter regulations. Proposed new EU rules aim to promote de facto equal treatment between local and posted workers. A new directive would ensure that posted workers receive the same pay and conditions as local staff. But Hungary and Poland are challenging the reform in the European court of justice and trying to get the new directive annulled.These actions have again opened up intense political debate, and threaten to curtail the rights of more than 2 million EU workers posted abroad. Countries such as  France, Germany and the Netherlands favour the new directive  because they are under the impression that these new rules will stop service companies from employing foreign EU workers below the local minimum wage. Hungary and Poland want to preserve their competitive advantage in the EU labour marketA key part of the new law would involved increased cooperation between national labour inspectorates. This is a step in the right directionbut labour inspectorates will still largely be unable to properly collect fines across borders. But there is also a need to better inform EU citizens – in the UK and elsewhere – about their rights, how to enforce them, and where to go for help, especially when they have limited language skills. This would make workers less vulnerable to exploitation and therefore possibly lead to better integration into the workforce and mutual understanding.If other countries are not to follow Britain’s lead, freedom of movement will have to be considered. Europe is only as strong as its solidarity. While Hungary and Poland still argue for the right of their workers to move freely within the EU, increasingly hostile anti-immigrant sentiment can be found in both countries. Support for freedom of movement may well wane if it is not as profitable to Hungarian or Polish citizens.Brexit will certainly complicate how freedom of movement of workers and services will be regulated and practised in the EU. Regardless, the issue of posted work has already revealed significant tensions.• Ines Wagner is senior researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Social Research, and the author of Workers Without Borders: Posted Work and Precarity in the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6c383a3c0e8cd1ebf4710979fd0ebf00b32f615/0_100_2746_1647/master/2746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bcd5be1d508a774890ceec463b8ab7e","title":"may save brexit deal tories party","story":"Can Theresa May save her deal? That depends on whether MPs – and in particular her own backbenchers – are looking for ladders to climb down or crosses on which to crucify themselves. Having given the prime minister another political bloody nose, are her colleagues on the hunt for compromises or is the opposition within her Conservative party basically implacable?There’s no single position, but there are hardliners on both sides of the Tory party. Many Conservatives could potentially be won round, having now registered their disapproval of the deal. But diehards are showing little interest in shifting position. A few extreme remainers, are determined to rerun the referendum, and so reject any Brexit, even the softest possible so-called Norway plus form. At the other end, kamikaze Eurosceptics seem prepared to bring down the entire temple to secure their ideal Brexit. “Bin the backstop,” they demand, something that will inexorably lead to a no-deal exit. Brexit itself now risks being killed by this sort of supporter – by those who claim to love it the most.Some of the opposition to the prime minister’s deal is, frankly, based on personal or political problems rather than the policy of what she’s actually agreed with the EU. Last month, May survived a confidence vote within the Conservative party in which 117 of her own MPs opposed her in a secret ballot on her leadership. On Tuesday, 118 of her MPs voted against her deal – almost the exact same margin. A sizeable slice of her party has just fallen out of love with her. And with the race to succeed her becoming ever more open, too many Tory big beasts have their eyes on a future prize.Part of this political mess is the prime minister’s fault. Even at the best of times, she is a wooden political performer. It’s striking that the strongest speeches defending May’s flagship policy – her Brexit deal – have been made by other ministers. Her isive rhetoric after the EU referendum with talk of “citizens of nowhere” and her stubborn refusal to guarantee rights for EU nationals living in the UK (contra the commitments of colleagues who had actually campaigned for leave) helped exacerbate isions in the country and the Conservative party, rather than bringing people together.But it’s also the case that Brexit was always going to require challenging compromises. Campaigns can be conducted in poetry governing requires prose. And negotiating, with a strong but wounded counter-party, which has its own interests, was always going to be difficult. Then again, May has made major mistakes, from triggering article 50 without an agreed plan, to accepting the concept of a backstop without locking down what it would mean.The biggest single factor shaping Brexit, though, is the result on 8 June 2017. In calling a general election, in which she subsequently lost her already slim majority, May set the course for what was bound to be a softer Brexit. She lost the ability to stare down opponents in the Commons, and damaged the credibility at home and in Brussels of her prior claim that she would leave without a deal.Despite Tuesday’s enormous defeat, little has ultimately changed. There are still just three options – Brexit with no deal (which a large majority of MPs are determined to prevent), stopping Brexit (probably via a second referendum), or leaving with a version of the prime minister’s deal. All three seem largely impossible. Yet one of those paths will have to be followed.There are noisy calls for a plan B, but the truth is there is no negotiated alternative deal on the table. Some demand a pivot to Norway plus, but its advocates admit this would mean accepting the entire binding withdrawal agreement, while tweaking just the political declaration to narrow the range of future outcomes. Plan B is premised on accepting plan A in full.May remains in a parlous position. A harder Brexit is not on offer from Brussels, and so any significant move in that direction would mean no deal. Shifting to a softer Brexit would alienate more of her own backbenchers. Although wounded, she is not yet politically finished, but she is fast running out of options. At some point, she may decide that she has one significant card left – committing to relinquish the party leadership after the end of article 50 to allow a new generation to lead the next stage of negotiations. Some critics of her deal have conceded to me, that this concession, combined with some further binding clarification of the backstop’s exit mechanism, could prevent them standing in the way of the deal.Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to try to trigger a general election may strengthen the prime minister. Firstly, it moves the political story on, away from whether she has a plan B. Second, she is almost certain to win the vote of confidence this evening, securing her own position. Third, if Labour’s bid to topple the government fails, attention will quickly shift to whether they now back a second referendum or not. If they do, Theresa May can present herself as the only national party leader determined to defend Brexit. That may just help bring some of the Conservative party back together again. But the next few weeks, as parliament seeks to wrestle control of Brexit, will mean no let up in the political crisis.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe.

Behold, a bell-tolling, haute remainer, yellow-vested, journalist-infested, shitbird-MP-crawling, flashmobbed performance art piece entitled: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THEOCRACY INSTEAD?If not, don’t rule it out. An awful lot of things are apparently back on the table after May’s flame-out, including – but not limited to – default no deal, extending article 50, a Norway-style arrangement, second referendum, and return to absolute monarchy, by either the Queen or David Attenborough.The scale of the task of unbreaking Britain is jointly summed up by the vote result, and by each of the polar-opposite factions outside parliament being convinced they’d won. Everyone celebrated maniacally. As far as the UK’s lo-viz yellow vest movement goes, Westminster pavements are now a great place to get hooked up with the right militia for you in the event of no deal. As for the more provisional wing of the People’s Vote, we no longer need to computer-model the answer to the question: what would happen if you gave everyone on Henman Hill crystal meth?At the heart of this scene, a physically crumbling parliament building, half propped up by scaffolding. Unfolding inside on Tuesday night, a parliamentary procedural of quite staggering plotholes and continuity errors. Welcome to the Blunderdome.After Stanley Baldwin, then prime minister, had made the abdication announcement in the House in 1936, the MP Harold Nicolson bumped into him in a corridor outside the chamber. The moment was obviously one of electrifying historic drama, yet Nicolson’s diary entry archly conveys Baldwin’s self-centric take on it.The same could not be said of Theresa May, who rose to the occasion like a replicant Anglepoise lamp. Basic shambles model. Indeed, speaking of the abdication, it’s grimly amusing to consider that Theresa May’s big intervention in the 2015 general election campaign was to warn that “if we saw a Labour government propped up by the SNP, it could be the biggest constitutional crisis since the abdication”. As it turned out, madam would have something rather bigger up her own sleeve.So what now? Well, there’s a motion of no confidence to while away today, and 72 days left on the Brexit clock. May’s serial dishonesty throughout this entire process saw jeers greet her post-vote claims of a new “constructive spirit” in which “the government will work harder at taking parliament with us”. The jeers were well founded, given it took barely hours for it to become clear that this wouldn’t extend to even speaking to Jeremy Corbyn. Which might well suit Labour’s leader, the High Triangulator, who is reportedly going to keep calling no confidence motions until one produces the answer he likes. An irony that will doubtless be appreciated by those of his supporters angling in vain for a second referendum.As for May, her clinical standoffishness is entirely of a piece with the way she has behaved for the best part of the two and a half years since the vote, and certainly since the 2017 election. One of the most remarkable, and indeed excruciating, things about May has been her insistence on governing like she’s got a landslide majority. Why has no one told her? She’s the Florence Foster Jenkins of politics, insulated from the realities of her situation by weird or venal enablers. Never has the intervention of a candid best mate been more needed. At some point in July 2017, surely Amber Rudd or whoever should have gone round and given May “The Talk”. Along the lines of: “Babe, true friends tell you the truth, amirite? Because if no one else is going to say this, then I will: the referendum vote was problematically close anyway, and then you totally spaffed your majority. Like, you literally have no majority. So … you need to stop acting like Mariah Carey, OK? On the plus side, you look great in that trouser suit and I’ve brought round two bottles of cava. Let’s get pissed and watch Working Girl again.” Alas, at no point since the election does this essential public service appear to have been performed.Somehow even less appealing than May’s performance, though, was the spectacle of politicians rushing to the telly cameras in its wake. Here comes Chris Grayling, the least appealing ferryman since Charon, who’s going to rule out a customs union right off the bat.Here comes voluminously overcoated Jacob Rees-Mogg, who still resembles an 11-year-old Jacob Rees-Mogg sitting on Nanny’s shoulders for a nursery game called Disaster Capitalist’s Bluff.Here come a lot of Tories claiming this all-systems clusterfuck is an “opportunity” to “go back to the EU”. And say what? “Look, if you’ll just give me three cosmetic concessions, then I feel sure I can get those elusive last 230 Infinity Stones.”And here comes the affectedly shambling figure of Boris Johnson – not so much a statesman as an Oxfam donation bag torn open by a fox – who could conceivably still end up prime minister of no-deal Britain. May needed to go again to the EU “with a high heart, fortified by the massive rejection of the House of Commons”, judged Johnson, speaking as always like a Taiwanese news animation of Winston Churchill. In the meantime, “we should be actively preparing for no deal with ever more enthusiasm”.As for Dominic Raab … dear dear. Show me someone who is trying harder than Dominic to make himself happen. OK, you’ve shown me The Saj and Gavin Williamson, and even cub health secretary Matt Hancock. One of the things you really have to admire about the Tory males is the time they make for self-care. Even at moments of really cataclysmically pressing national business, they insist on carving out the sort of me-time that is, say, a thinly disguised leadership speech at the Centre for Policy Studies. Yes, let the historical records show that on the eve of the vote, Dominic Raab trying to look like tomorrow’s man in an address that, among other things, floated the idea of “Asbos for business”. Not now, mate, yeah? We’re a bit busy.Yet Dominic did a second lectern event in the hours before the vote, this time teaming up with David Davis and Arlene Foster, who still has all the warmth of the matriarch of a remote farm who retains the passports of her labourers.As for Davis, we’ll play out with an interview the former Brexit secretary gave a German magazine last weekend, in which he handpicked two mindboggling examples of situations in which Britain was Definitely Not Wrong. “Oh, I’m certain that Brexit will be a success,” Davis breezed. “Remember, every single major issue in our history is one where you might be right or wrong. Appeasement before the second world war, we might be right or wrong. Suez, we might be right or wrong.” Well. I for one can’t wait to see what’s going to happen next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85091bf00b8f404035703b520996c5cd51ff555b/3_0_3007_1804/master/3007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2cdc9cec6f935447ceed4d75fe61b6","title":"sold the first sales that started big businesses","story":"Even household names started somewhere. From the broken laser pointer that kicked off eBay to the matchbox that made Ikea, here are six big businesses that started with one small saleeBayWith 177 million buyers, 429m downloads of the eBay app, and more than 1bn listings at any one time, it’s hard to believe it all began with the humble sale of a broken laser pointer. That’s what eBay founder Pierre Omidyar listed from his living room in San Jose back in 1995 to see if his fledgling online marketplace, then called AuctionWeb, would catch on. To his utter amazement a bidding war ensued and the bust $1 item sold for $14.83, seemingly proving Omidyar’s belief that trading is a basic human impulse. The site’s growth was meteoric, with profits doubling month after month, and today it’s a multi-billion-dollar business. But, though these days eBay sees its fair share of mega-money transactions, the beating heart of the company is still those humble sales – from a broken laser pointer to Beanie Babies, well-thumbed paperbacks, fidget spinners and Justin Timberlake’s half-eaten French toast.VirginNow a billionaire business mogul who actually owns an island, Virgin founder Richard Branson was still in short trousers when he first showed a knack for buying and selling. As a boy living in Tanyards Farm in Yorkshire, Branson roped in a school pal to help him plant 400 Christmas trees. He hoped to make £800 profit once they’d grown two years later and the friends agreed to share the cash. His plans were scuppered, however, when rabbits overran the plot, decimating all but a couple of sorry looking sprigs. Undeterred, he found a rather vengeful way to claw back some profit – and pride – by successfully hunting the rabbits and selling them to his local butchers for a shilling each. Not quite the boyhood fortune he’d hoped for, but from little acorns did megastores and jumbo jets grow.IkeaThink of Sweden’s most famous export and Ikea tends to trump even Abba. But the late founder of the furniture giant started small – tiny, in fact. To help his family make ends meet in the remote farming region they called home, Ingvar Kamprad became rural Sweden’s answer to Del Boy. Aged just five, he flogged matches to neighbours, before moving on to seeds, fountain pens, lighters and nylons. Aged 17, Kamprad’s father gave him some money for doing well in school. He used it to launch Ikea, an abbreviation of Ingvar Kamprad from Elmtaryd, Agunnaryd – his boyhood home. Realising he could sell furniture at a lower price if customers had to put in some of the work by assembling it themselves, the flat pack was born, and world domination was in the bag.Jo MaloneThe brains behind those distinctive scented candles in the covetable cream and black boxes had a passion for fragrance from year dot. The daughter of a beautician, as a little girl Jo Malone concocted her own perfumes from grated soap and the flowers in the family’s garden. Later, working as a florist, she gave facials in the evenings from her kitchen using her homemade creams. After giving her Nutmeg \u0026amp Ginger Bath Oil to customers, orders started rolling in – she knew she was on to something. Armed with a couple of saucepans, four plastic jugs and bucket-loads of ideas, she invented fragrances with striking combinations, such as her signature scent Lime Basil \u0026amp Mandarin. Opening her first shop in 1994, Malone eventually sold her fragrance empire to Estée Lauder in 1999 for an undisclosed sum, staying on as creative director and chair until the French cosmetics giant acquired her remaining stake in the company in 2006. But it wasn’t long before Malone returned to her passion – by 2011 she had launched Jo Loves, a new fragrance brand.Forever 21Forever 21 co-founders Don Won Chang and his wife Jin Sook are a bona fide case of rags to riches – in the rag trade. In 1981 the young Korean couple landed in LA in search of the American dream, but they didn’t find it where they were expecting. Having worked in coffee shops growing up, Don was sure roasted beans would lead to his pot of gold. In fact, it was a canny observation he made while serving coffee that saw the couple go from stony broke to billionaires. Don noticed that his customers with the flashiest cars were people in the garment industry and a lightbulb came on. The couple opened a discount store in 1984, raking in $700,000 in the first year and now bring in roughly $4.4bn in sales from 600 stores worldwide.Annie MaloneAnnie Malone’s achievements would be impressive by today’s standards, but they’re positively staggering given her start in life. Born in 1869 to former slaves, Malone founded the black cosmetics industry at the beginning of the 19th-century by inventing her own line of non-damaging hair products, with the aim of providing a better straightening solution for African American women. Calling her first product Wonderful Hair Grower, Malone drummed up custom by selling door-to-door in her home territory of St Louis before expanding to the point that, by 1917, she opened a vast training facility called Poro College – complete with a manufacturing plant, cosmetics store, gym, auditorium, bakery, chapel and roof garden. Eventually she employed 75,000 Poro agents, including fellow philanthropist Madam CJ Walker, at franchises all over the world. The first black female millionaire, Malone gave most of her money to her community, and was president of the board of directors of an orphanage, among her many charitable endeavours.Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Inspectors will have a longer period to assess the quality of teaching and will interview staff as part of the process.The proposals were welcomed by Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England.“I remain extremely concerned about the number of schools gaming the system and fiddling exam league tables through off-rolling, and I hope that Ofsted will grasp this opportunity to come down hard on schools who are letting down some of the most vulnerable children,” Longfield said.The new framework was also backed by Damian Hinds, the education secretary for England: “As we have improved the curriculum and reformed GCSEs and A-levels, we have been fully united with Ofsted in our drive to ensure all children and young people benefit from an ambitious, broad and balanced curriculum.“This framework reflects that approach and our continuing activity around exclusions and off-rolling.”Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, welcomed the move to address off-rolling but said more significant reform was needed to ensure that Ofsted didn’t add to the pressures on teachers.“Labour will address these issues by giving our schools the resources they need, reforming the accountability system and taking concrete steps to end the scandal of off-rolling,” Rayner said.The National Association of Head Teachers said it was calling on its members to use the consultation to amend the proposed framework.“In its current form, this proposal from Ofsted will cause widespread concern amongst school leaders. There’s nothing here that will reduce stress and increase the reliability of judgements, which many say is sorely needed,” said Nick Brook, the NAHT’s deputy general secretary.The new framework will also see an increased emphasis on behaviour and attitudes in a revised category, with schools able to be rated as having outstanding behaviour if pupils “behave with consistently high respect for others”. In particular it notes that schools in “challenging circumstances” need to take action to create a “positive learning environment” to be awarded outstanding status.A recent Ofsted inspection of a secondary school in Poole, Magna Academy, saw inspectors endorse its use of “silent corridor” policies, with pupils barred from talking while moving between lessons.A new inspection area – personal development – will rate how a school prepares pupils for life in modern Britain, while the leadership category will now encompass issues such as off-rolling, which Harford defined as “getting rid of people because they’re not going to get the right scores”.In a nod to an ongoing dispute among teachers, Ofsted’s consultation document notes that “a isive debate has emerged in some quarters that creates an unnecessary opposition between knowledge and skills” and concludes that the two are “closely interconnected”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f2c8d9060547f0adb9d1733a9fac5e6ee7908c1/0_71_5076_3046/master/5076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a4a921de90d6a1ff8ea040363aa9c5a","title":"young mothers at university i breastfed at 5am while writing essays","story":"Pregnancy can be seen as a barrier to university – and young student mothers say they lack support I started university, aged 19, with my 12-week-old baby. While other freshers were getting to know each other, I was squeezing my breasts into a pump and cursing the price of nappies. My life as an Oxford student and mum was so unexpected that one student thought the “baby” I talked about was a doll. It’s 2019: women earn scholarships while pregnant and mothers study at top universities while raising children, but the existence of student parents still goes unacknowledged.I crammed a full academic schedule into my daughter’s nursery hours. It was exhausting. I breastfed at 5am while trying to finish essays. My tutors were very kind but, as an institution, Oxford does not expect you to be a mother. More than 700 Oxford students had children in 2016, but many feel they are not on the university’s radar. Ash Mohanaprakas, who discovered she was pregnant during her undergraduate degree, says she felt “constantly lonely” trying to reconcile motherhood with her studies.“I almost expected to be disowned,” she says. “My mum had been so proud of me. Now, she was asking me to hide when her gossipy friend visited.”Already facing rejection from her community, Mohanaprakas struggled to cope financially at Oxford with her son. Unable to get childcare support from student finance, she was also barred from the university hardship fund, which regards childcare as a pre-planned circumstance. This rhetoric risks discounting whole groups of people – lone parents who lack a partner’s income, students with unexpected pregnancies, those who can’t afford childcare – from places they have gained on merit. Mohanaprakas could only afford two days of childcare a week for her son, which gave her just enough time to go to tutorials. She cared for him the rest of the week and wrote her essays at night.While the university supports staff with parenting responsibilities – it has a £5,000 fund for returning carers – students with identical needs can feel overlooked. “I couldn’t find a place to breastfeed,” says Anna Sarkissian, who returned to her DPhil in anthropology at Oxford when her daughter was four months old. “I pumped milk in a communal toilet, trying not to touch anything, while people banged on the door outside.“It took a long time just to find somewhere to nurse and work. Eventually my department found me a small office, which was great, but you have to push for everything you need to be able to complete your degree. As student parents, we’re already overtaxed. We’re just trying to survive.”“I worry that other researchers see motherhood as this frivolous thing,” says Sarkissian. “It’s difficult for women in academia. Once you have kids, people doubt your level of commitment. If I had to wash my breast pump in my department’s kitchen, I’d rush to do it as quickly as possible. I didn’t want to run into any of my colleagues. I had this fear people would think I was distracted or not working hard enough. There’s still a stigma surrounding breastfeeding it’s viewed as a private activity which doesn’t belong in the workplace.”Student parents face specific financial pressures. For Sarkissian, UK childcare fees – around £12,000 a year – are unaffordable, and this is with the university’s discounted rate. The family are constantly travelling back to Canada where they can afford to live, and where childcare is sufficiently subsidised.For single parent Summer Qassim, waking up at 4.30am is how she balances her master’s degree with caring for her two children, aged six and seven. “It asks a lot of my body,” she says. “If I have a 9.30am seminar, everything has to be done by 6.30am, before I get the kids ready for school.”Where a partner could help in the absence of affordable childcare, Qassim lacks support. “I had to get neighbours to sit with my kids during their school holidays, when I had classes,” she says. “I felt awful. Someone suggested setting up a childcare camp in my college, but I was the only student who needed it. This is where funding can really help single parents, but most funding doesn’t acknowledge children. There’s this assumption that if you have kids, it’s your responsibility and you’re on your own.”While Qassim describes her department as “great”, with professors who changed class schedules for her and lent her books, she believes universities need to recognise student parents as a minority. “I bet there are so many students with children who haven’t even thought about applying. I want them to know that they can, and it won’t be easy, but it’s possible.”Mohanaprakas, who graduated in 2014, says: “I want to show women in my position that they can achieve anything they want.” Observing the determination of student parents, it’s clear that pregnancy is not a barrier. But the onus should not be entirely on iniduals to prove their children will not get in the way of systems that could easily be more accessible and welcoming.Student parents make fantastic students. You can’t balance a degree and the overwhelming job of parenting without being hardworking and resilient. I’m even more determined to succeed now I’m studying for my daughter’s future, as well as my own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0fbcf49626a2cf93fc8a8ee13eb160b2bbaca5/0_161_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cfd871074b9337fde93ecc3654d25e0","title":"campaigners stop truck exhausted calves calls live export reform ramsgate kent","story":"Charities and government officials intervene at Ramsgate port in Kent to prevent animals’ journey time exceeding legal limitsAnimal welfare charities have backed calls by the RSPCA to substantially reduce journey times for live exports as the government considers a ban on the practice after Brexit.The RSPCA has appealed to the EU Commission after a lorry was stopped at a UK port by the charity along with other campaigners and government officials on 10 January.The groups intervened to stop the lorry carrying about 250 calves after the animals appeared “exhausted”, and to avoid the vehicle exceeding the maximum transport time.Current laws state that calves must not be transported for more than nine hours without a one-hour rest period, and not longer than 21 hours before a 24-hour rest.The RSPCA estimated the lorry, which had come from Scotland, had been travelling for around 70 hours including rest stops, en route to Spain via Calais. If the animals had been taken on board the boat, they would have been in transit for longer than is permitted.Kent Action Against Live Exports (Kaale) said it would support an eight-hour maximum journey from the point of production to the animal’s final destination.The campaign group told the  that for journey times that exceed the legal limit, on average sheep travel for 14 hours from the UK, then have a one-hour rest on the lorry followed by another 14-hour route.For calves, aged between two and six weeks old, the journey is often nine hours followed by a one-hour rest and a further nine hours to Europe, north Africa and the Middle East.Yvonne Birchall, secretary of Kaale, said: “We believe no animal should travel for more than eight hours to have their throat cut.Kaale said 28 lorries full of sheep and three containing calves passed through Kent last year, compared with a total of 34 in 2017 and 111 in 2013.In 1995, an estimated 30 lorries a day were passing through Dover. The issue became a touchstone of the animal rights movement, and regular protests at the ports against the export trade became increasingly angry. That same year animal rights protester Jill Phipps, 31, tragically died after being crushed under the wheels of a truck transporting veal calves to Coventry airport for export. In 2018, ferry operator P\u0026ampO stopped carrying calves to Europe after animal welfare concerns were raised by a BBC documentary, Disclosure: the Dark Side of Dairy.Yvonne’s husband Ian Birchall, chairman of Kaale, said the route through Kent to the continent has been used for years with only temporary gaps following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001 and the cases of BSE in the early 1990s.Mr Birchall said: “We cannot trust the authorities to do the right thing.“Unless people are going to police it, it’s going to be broken.”Scotland is central to the trade in calves because elsewhere in Britain, ferry companies refuse to carry animals for slaughter, fattening or for the veal trade.James West, senior policy manager for Compassion in World Farming, is calling for the European Commission to introduce a one-off maximum permitted journey time of eight hours across the EU.He told the : “Compassion believes that the long distance transport of animals for slaughter and fattening is completely inhumane and unnecessary.“In the UK, calves aged just a couple of weeks are being sent from Scotland, via Ramsgate, to Spain.“These animals are poorly equipped to deal with the stresses of a journey lasting over 60 hours.“The recent sailing from Ramsgate, which saw calves stuck in vehicles on board the export vessel for over 14 hours, highlights why such a journey limit is required.”He said that in addition to an eight-hour limit within the EU, the organisation was calling on the Department for Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra), to end the live export of farm animals from the UK at the earliest possible opportunity post-Brexit.The government’s Farm Animal Welfare Committee is reviewing evidence and is expected to make recommendations this year – which could include banning live exports when Britain leaves the EU.A Defra spokesman said: “Animals deserve respect and care at all stages of their lives, which is why we have consistently said that we will control the export of live farm animals for slaughter once we leave the European Union.“For that reason we have conducted a call for evidence on how we can achieve this, including through a possible ban.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc8d335a967df0088704101ecc543aa83c525cab/0_1421_6808_4085/master/6808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b116e4ac9493b9cde9f0ec2d03a55a0","title":"bean burger felicity cloake recipe vegan","story":"A Mexican-inspired version of the meat-free burger with black bean, avocado and spicy homemade sauceI’m delighted that commercial meatless burgers have come on in leaps and bounds in recent years.

Scoop out with a slotted spoon, then cook the broad beans in the same water for five minutes. Drain, and then, when cool enough to handle, slip off the tough outer skins to reveal the tender green bean beneath.Drain the black beans, if necessary, then put half of them in a bowl with the potatoes and mash together until fairly smooth it doesn’t need to be a puree, but you shouldn’t be able to see any significant lumps. Add the remaining black beans and the skinned broad beans, and mash again, more roughly this time, leaving some intact.Heat the oil in a small frying pan on a low-medium heat and saute the onion and pepper until soft but not browned. Stir in the garlic and jalapeño, if using, and cook for another couple of minutes, stirring until the garlic loses its raw smell. Add to the bowl with the bean and potato mixture.Put a dry pan on a high heat, then dry-fry the cumin and coriander seeds for a minute or so, until fragrant. Grind to a powder with a pinch of salt in a mortar or spice grinder, then add to the bean mixture. Add the chopped chipotle or smoked paprika.Squeeze in the lime juice and add the fresh coriander. Season and mix to combine. Taste the burger mixture and adjust the seasoning if you think it needs a bit more lime, salt or chilli. Using damp hands, form the mixture into four chunky burgers, put them on a plate and refrigerate for at least an hour.While the burgers are chilling, make the burger sauce. Put the chickpeas and their water in a narrow, flat‑bottomed jug or bowl slightly larger than the head of a stick blender, and whizz until smooth. Continue to whizz as you mix in the oil in a steady stream. (Alternatively, use the small bowl of a food processor.)Once you have a loose, mayonnaise-like consistency (it won’t be as stiff as an egg mayonnaise, but more like a thick yoghurt), fold in the ketchup and mustard, then season to taste, adding more of either if you so desire. Chill until ready to serve the sauce will firm up a bit in the fridge.Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)325Fgas 3, and spread out the cornmeal on a plate. Roll the chilled burgers in the cornmeal, to coat all over. Heat two tablespoons of neutral oil in a ovenproof frying pan over a medium-high flame, then fry the burgers for three minutes on one side, or until the cornmeal is well browned.

But wait! James Rodríguez could be about to jet in and calm the tensions.Colombia’s 2012 World Cup hero is in the second season of a two-year loan spell at Bayern Munich but the Bundesliga champions are not too fussed about making the move permanent for £39.5m, and he would happily pack his bags for London if Arsenal can cover the remaining £3m of the £11.5m loan fee Bayern agreed with Real Madrid.With so little cash swilling around the Emirates the club’s bean counters are said to have come up with the ingenious idea of flogging Özil to Internazionale or Juventus, and have told the Italian giants of their plan. The German has no interest in leaving but help may be at hand in the form of Mohamed Elneny, who is interesting Roma and would be delighted to escape the Gunners bench.Ole Gunnar Solskjær has told anyone who will listen that he will not not give up the keys to the Manchester United manager’s office without a fight, and he is ready to bare his teeth in the transfer market. The Norwegian has told Marouane Fellaini to find a new club and has muscled his way to the front of the queue for Cengiz Under, with a £50m summer transfer in the pipeline. Yannick Carrasco is available right now, so desperate is he to return to Europe from China, and the former Atlético Madrid winger seems to have had his head turned by Solskjær’s barnstorming United revolution. Carrasco’s wife, Noémie Happart, was certainly happy to play ball when quizzed about whether United had joined the list of clubs chasing her husband’s signature. “Yes they are very interested,” teased Miss Belgium 2013. “I do not hide it but nothing is signed.”Chelsea are close to landing Leandro Paredes after submitting a second offer worth around £35m to Zenit Saint Petersburg for the Argentinian midfielder.Leicester are set to sign trialist Ali Reghba from Bohemians after the teenager scored twice in an under-23s game.And unlikeliest transfer tale of the week has to be Cristhian Stuani’s proposed move to Barcelona. The Middlesbrough flop has been banging the goals in for Girona for the past two seasons and could be in line for a shock £15m transfer to the Camp Nou. Álvaro Morata is also under consideration but Barça will only sanction a loan move for the Chelsea forward if Denis Suárez’s transfer to Arsenal goes through.

Supporting the EU comes from the head whereas wishing to leave the EU comes from the heart, as the MP Rachel Reeves once put it. And yet, the attitude of some towards a second referendum is breathtakingly reckless and cavalier. Almost anything – as long as it brings us one step closer to the UK staying in the EU – is countenanced and justified.I remember one Cambridge lunch, on a day when cabinet ministers were resigning over Theresa May’s deal, in which a colleague told me he would cheer every time a new resignation was announced. The more chaotic the better, he said, because chaos makes shelving Brexit that much more likely.So, many hoping for another vote will have cheered as MPs dramatically voted down the prime minister’s deal last night. Yet making a second vote happen would require tearing up much of what we consider to be the elementary workings of British parliamentary democracy. Since the June 2016 referendum, MPs have repeatedly voted in support of the result, in the name of implementing a decision taken by a majority of the electorate. Many seem to forget that between the original Brexit vote and today, we had a general election. Conservative and Labour parties both committed themselves in their manifestos to implementing the referendum result. Only the Liberal Democrats could say that they opposed Brexit in an election that saw them pick up only a handful more seats than the catastrophic 2015 election. The same happened over the so-called “great repeal bill”, the legislation required to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, when MPs rejected an amendment calling for a referendum on whether to support the deal or remain in the EU.For the House of Commons to endorse a second referendum, it would have to repeal past Brexit legislation in a manner that flouts the position adopted by the main parties in the last general election. Were this to happen, it would tear up established relations between executive and legislature, pitting popular and parliamentary sovereignty against one another. Parliament would in effect be seeking, in a Brechtian fashion, to dissolve “the people” and put another in place that will vote differently in a second referendum.Why should it not be possible to change one’s mind in a democracy? Of course it should be, but calls for a second referendum have very little to do with a changing of minds and more to do with a hardening of views. What lies behind the call for another vote is a belief that those who voted to leave in June 2016 should change their minds. The fact that its supporters call it “the people’s vote”, as if the first vote wasn’t, lets the cat out of the bag. Driving the desire to have a second vote is a firm belief that the first one was an illegitimate act, a subversion of democratic politics that saw a leave victory achieved through a mix of lies and misconceptions.This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.This is what the second referendum campaigners hang their arguments on, so it merits some scrutiny. At the heart of it is an epistemic claim: people did not understand what was at stake and now that they do, we should give them a chance to vote differently. Instead of basing our political system on two fundamental principles – equal political rights (for those over 18) and majority rule – this claim introduces a new element, knowledge. It presumes that people who voted leave first time around were ignorant or misguided, or both. It also suggests that one’s right to act politically rests in part upon one’s ability to be informed about the issues in question.Who can determine whether people are well enough informed to allow a result to pass? Do advocates of this kind of knowledge-based democracy accept that access to knowledge is fundamentally shaped by social and economic power? Thus organised, we ide our political world into those who know and those who do not. Or, more truthfully, between those who are sure that they know and those who are not so sure. This is a subjective difference, requiring an arbiter to draw the line. As things stand, the only arbiters at present are MPs themselves, who we know are made up predominantly of remainers. Would we instead create an independent body, made up of the great and the good, empowered to decide on the cognitive capacities of voters? I imagine not, but the elitism underpinning arguments for a second referendum couldn’t be clearer.If a second referendum would have such a corrosive effect on British parliamentary democracy, why are we even considering it? The answer to this lies once again with parliament. Though we now know that there is an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons who reject May’s deal, and a likely majority against “no deal”, there is no majority on anything else. The only practical alternative floated thus far is “Norway plus” which, if compared with May’s deal, is a radical step away from Brexit.The great convenience of a second referendum for MPs is that it absolves them of all responsibility. Rather than making hard choices themselves, MPs could simply pass them back to the electorate. Recently, we have heard a lot of fancy talk about parliament taking back control over Brexit a second referendum would be quite the opposite and that is what makes it a likely outcome.A second referendum would be a blow to the heart of our parliamentary democracy. It would introduce the principle – elitist to the core – that the legitimacy of a political decision rests upon a judgment about the knowledge that informed it. And it would rely on a dirty plebiscitarianism as a way out of the political impasse in Westminster. Those arguing for a second referendum should be careful what they wish for. Chaos is rarely a harbinger of good outcomes.• Chris Bickerton teaches politics at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2641c62fa0fffb20c66f57b9bc65729c8e52ffe1/0_562_9108_5466/master/9108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8baf2a6693c82ed60fd13dec6c0c37","title":"even batter than real thing fish and chips goes vegan","story":"Quorn launches ‘fishless fillets’ made with protein derived from fungusFish and chips is the latest British favourite to get a vegan makeover, with Quorn launching both battered and breaded “fishless fillets”.The fillets will be made using protein derived from a fungus and the company promises to replicate the texture and flakiness of real fish. The launch follows the success of the Greggs vegan sausage roll, which has been selling out across the country.Both products aim to capitalise on the rapidly growing numbers of people eating less meat, fish and dairy products. About a third of Britons have stopped or reduced their consumption of meat, while the Veganuary campaign signed up a record 250,000 people in 193 countries this year.People are reducing their consumption of animal products for a variety of reasons, including concerns over their health, animal welfare and the environment. Most people in rich nations eat more meat than is healthy and research indicates that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact.The Quorn fillets, which will be available in supermarkets from March, give consumers a new alternative to fish. Many of the world’s fish stocks are overexploited and independent research has shown mycoprotein causes lower carbon emissions than farmed fish.The fishless fillets have taken five years to develop, said Geoff Bryant, the technical director at Quorn Foods UK, who added: “The launch marks the logical next step in helping people reduce our reliance on our oceans for protein.”In 2018, the UK launched more vegan food products  than any other nation. The Quorn fillets join a wide range of “faux fish” products on sale in supermarkets, from fishless fingers to vegan versions of tuna, smoked salmon, prawns, scampi, sushi and even caviar. Vegan alternatives to fish, such as “tofish”, have also gone on sale in pubs and chip shops.However, Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said: “It is perfectly possible to buy and consume fish from sustainable sources. As the International Council for Exploration of the Sea makes clear, all of the main species groups in the north-east Atlantic are not only fished at sustainable levels but are on track to produce high average yields.”Joseph Poore, a food sustainability expert at the University of Oxford, said: “Quorn is leading the market in innovation, and I hope they go further by backing up their sustainability claims with labels on their products spelling out their emissions, impact on bioersity, water and pesticide use.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5452df66265abe407ba2027a23962c3c3958e4/0_327_6091_3655/master/6091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc1002507f2f62aecaf203b416d7f9b7","title":"giving london a brum for its money a locals guide to birmingham","story":"Britain’s second city is a erse cultural hub and on the radar as a global destination in its own right. Who better than resident Tom Cullen to show us around?The paint-by-numbers introduction to an article about the best things to do in Birmingham might go something like this: “Everyone thought Birmingham was a bit crap but great news, we’re wrong!”Brummies acknowledge this backhanded compliment with a trademark shrug and a wry smile. And then they move on. But this line of thinking perpetuates the theory that the city is merely improving, which is nonsense. It’s gone far beyond that, becoming a bonafide global destination for visitors and, perhaps more importantly, an unsurpassable home for more than a million people.So much was happening here that I turned my back on a 12-year career in London’s magazine business to launch a title dedicated to Birmingham.So, where to begin? How about on arrival at Bonehead, just 60 seconds from the new-look New Street station. A beer and chicken spot just off the rejuvenated John Bright Street, Bonehead is furnished with wooden benches, street art and fly posters, and its cooks possess quite a skill for deep-frying bird and dousing it in fiery Nashville sauces or cooling Korean kimchee. I eat alone there with somewhat worrying regularity.Eight minutes north by foot is Ikon Gallery, the immaculate neo-gothic former Oozells Street Board School. The Japanese cherry blossoms that decorate the square on which it and its exquisite tenant, Yorks Cafe, sit are months from bloom, but the building – which comes complete with a singing lift – brings a Hogwartsian beauty to Brindleyplace. Haroon Mirza’s mind-bending Reality is Somehow What We Expect it to Be is Ikon’s current feature exhibition, on show from now until 24 February 2019.Ikon doesn’t just stick to its own Grade II-listed walls, but makes a virtue of teaming up with other interesting locations across the city (venue collaboration is something of a Brum tradition). Right now, the Ikon team is working with Medicine Bakery and Gallery to exhibit Procession Banners – the result of artist Lucy Orta’s collaboration with female prisoners at HMP Downview to design 30 banners to mark 100 years since women won the vote. It’s on until 20 January 2019, and you can grab the city’s best cronut from the beautiful little bakery on your way in.Ikon’s near-neighbour, the Rep, is the longest-established of Britain’s building-based theatre companies and its productions are of the calibre you would expect with that in mind. Head there with the kids to catch award-winning director Liam Steel’s reimagining of The Wizard of Oz, which runs until 13 January or schedule in a visit for June 2019, when the indomitable Sir Ian McKellen brings his remarkable solo show to the theatre.The Hippodrome, the UK’s most popular single-auditorium theatre, is home to the Birmingham Royal Ballet, currently performing the Nutcracker to packed-out audiences. If you’re going, stop by at Gaijin for pre or post-show sushi. It’s a restaurant that the ’s own Jay Rayner recently waxed lyrical about, putting at least one nail in the theory that Birmingham has no decent mid-range restaurants. Hit up Harborne Kitchen (try the wagyu lasagne) or the new Nocturnal Animals for similar-priced eats. And of course, for those looking to spend a little more there are plenty of Michelin-starred restaurants: Simpsons and Purnell’s to name a couple.I pedal every weekday through Cannon Hill park, a space with beauty every bit as arresting as London’s major parks, and it always warms me, even in the frosty months, to see the multicultural mix of people jogging or dog-walking, or simply sitting on a bench and being in Birmingham. My kids love this place, almost as much the new Legoland Discovery Centre, or “Nemo spotting” at the National Sea Life Centre and gooning around with the interactive water features of ThinkTank’s Science Garden.ThinkTank is part of Birmingham Museums Trust: eight historical venues (including Aston Hall, Sarehole Mill and Soho House) that play contrary to the theory that Birmingham demolishes its most beautiful buildings.And of course, we have history – an abundance of it. Our town hall has hosted notable speakers such as Joseph Chamberlain, Charles Dickens and Clement Atlee. Continuing its history of erse content, it hosted the contentious Jordan B Peterson last month, three days before the less contentious Fun DMC, the UK’s only family-friendly block party. Mountaineer Chris Bonnington is in town on 5 December, and the Birmingham Town Hall and Symphony Hall is teaming up with the Hare \u0026amp Hounds, one of the city’s best pubs and music venues, to host local jazz saxophonist Soweto Kinch, on 6 December. Kinch regularly puts his name to the Flyover Show, an almost annual music, art and dance event that celebrates black culture in Birmingham.My office is based in the Victorian-era Great Western Arcade. Shoppers regularly wander in looking for the Georgian Piccadilly Arcade, and vice versa. It’s one of Birmingham’s charming mix ups, like not knowing in the 80s which shopping centre was the Pavilions and which one was the Pallasades. Whichever arcade you’re in, you’ll discover independent traders – the best in their respective fields – cutting hair, carving sandwiches and pouring coffee.The Balti Triangle, a name that should be known globally, seems eye-wateringly overlooked as a tourist destination. Someone’s failure to signpost it, front and centre, from New Street station, really rips my naan bread. It’s the beating heart of Birmingham, which is the beating heart of Britain, and it deserves the sort of visitor numbers that the now American-owned Cadbury World attracts regularly .Just south of town (and we always call it “town”, never “the city centre”) sits Digbeth, often dubbed “the Shoreditch of Birmingham” (never by a Brummie, though – we refuse to piggyback). Digbeth’s just Digbeth to us, and that’s how we like it. Home to Dig Brew Co, a brewery that admittedly would fit nicely in east London, and the Clean Kilo, the UK’s largest zero-waste supermarket. In October, the Sunday Times called Digbeth the coolest neighbourhood in Britain. Digbeth, greeted the compliment in typical Birmingham style. It gave a wry smile. Shrugged.

I am a Syrian national based in Germany and, to avoid any problems, I checked that my documents were in order on BA’s website and arrived at Heathrow three hours early. However, the BA staff member at the boarding gate was unable to read German or French and refused to accept my documents. She humiliated me in front of other passengers, saying I would not be allowed to board. I eventually found a staff member who confirmed my documents were in order and booked me onto the next flight. I reached Lyon at midnight and missed the connecting bus to Grenoble where I’d prepaid for a hotel room, so I had to spend another €74 on a room at the airport finally reaching Grenoble 14 hours later than planned and on a Sunday when everything was closed. The stress and exhaustion affected my presentation and I did less well then hoped. Your experience is, alas, not uncommon for non-EU passengers. Last October I exposed the plight of travellers, some refugees or immigrants with residency permits, denied boarding because they were wrongly told they needed visas to travel within the European Economic Area (EEA). A little-known consequence of the 1985 Schengen Agreement that abolished border checks was that airlines were effectively substituted as border controllers. They face a fine of between €3,000 (£2,640) and €5,000 if they are found to have flown non-EU nationals with inadequate or forged documentation into the EEA and have to shoulder the cost and responsibility of flying them back to the country they started from.Small wonder, then, airline staff err on the side of caution.After two months you had still received no more than a holding reply from BA. But, under the media spotlight, it has at last stumped up the statutory €250 compensation for denied boarding and a refund for the emergency hotel room. None of which compensates for the humiliation and stress.Although it admits you were incorrectly barred, it admits no fault saying: “We are required to ensure all customers have valid documents for the country of destination … we have apologised for the delay as a result of additional checks.”Caymanian DB was similarly barred by Norwegian Air when trying to fly with her partner and two friends from New York to Paris. She was wrongly told she needed a visa and directed to the French consulate which meant a weekend stay in a New York hotel waiting for it to open. The consulate then confirmed a visa was not required. They then had to pay for new tickets to Paris via London and Eurostar leaving them around £5,000 out of pocket. Only this week, five months after the aborted trip and after the Observer intervened, did Norwegian pay $2,422. It says: “We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and delay caused by incorrect travel eligibility information flagged by a database which is used by airlines across the world. Norwegian has carefully reviewed the circumstances and will reimburse the cost of train travel and fulfil our obligations under EU compensation regulations.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Brexit has split a once stable country in two and transformed its politicians into lemmings, throwing themselves off the white cliffs into the sea. It’s great theatre – but tragic.”Writing in the Spanish daily El País, Lluís Bassets warned that Tuesday’s vote had been far from decisive, despite the scale of May’s defeat, and worse could be to come.“To the misfortune of the British, and perhaps also the Europeans, this Tuesday was a historic day that does not preclude more historic days – all accompanied by the tragic storm clouds that tend to shadow history,” he wrote.Bassets said “the great shredding machine that is Brexit” was still hard at work, “fed by uncertainty, bitterness and rancour – the three dismal feelings that May evoked in her defeat speech, and the three evil spirits that only grow with each day that Brexit remains unresolved”.In an editorial, the rightwing ABC said that since neither May nor parliament had shown themselves capable of dealing with the crisis, “the most sensible thing to do would be hold another referendum, as voters get to grips with the true arguments rather than just the nationalist-populist propaganda of the pro-Brexit lobby”.The online paper eldiario.es noticed that the environment minister, Michael Gove, had invoked the famous Game of Thrones line, “Winter is coming”. Gove was “one of the heavyweights in the party, that had the most influence in the Brexit referendum”, wrote Iñigo Sáenz de Ugarte.“Gove and others like him brought winter to British politics and are now horrified at how cold things have got. Too cold for their fellow countrymen.”In Sweden’s Aftonbladet, Wolfgang Hansson said May’s historic defeat flowed from “one of the biggest mistakes a British prime minister has ever made: David Cameron’s promise in 2013 to hold a referendum on Britain’s EU membership”.That decision had “ided the British people into two tribes that over time have become bitter enemies”, Hansson said. “A proud, once-great power is now dedicated to committing serious self-harm – which could also damage Sweden … And no one, I repeat no one, knows what will happen now.”The German press was more constructive, Berliner Morgenpost saying the situation in the UK was now so desperate that the EU must adapt. “The bloc has negotiated hard, wanting to set an example, and has pushed May right up against the wall,” it said. “It’s time for the EU heads to leap over their own shadows and offer a compromise. It is not yet too late to give May support.”The Rheinische Post, however, asked what might happen if the British stayed. What sort of country would it be? A “traumatised partner … would be far harder to integrate than before,” it said. “A politically hopelessly ided and lame Britain could cause a great deal of harm within the EU.“Which is why, for both sides, it would actually be better if the British were to complete their exit. If they then notice in the next few years that the EU maybe wasn’t the hell on earth they had thought it to be, they could gladly return.”France’s Les Echos said it was “difficult to say what will happen” over the next few days, since “the rejection of the text by such a huge margin, 70 days from Brexit day, risks plunging the country into deep uncertainty”.Le Monde had a portrait of May (“Shipwrecked by Brexit”) saying the prime minister was “valiant, but without a clear vision on Europe … She has shown herself, for the last two years, incapable of implementing Britain’s exit from the EU.”The paper said the rejection of the Brexit text “aggravates the uncertainty over the UK’s future.” Europe1 radio said the defeat was “humiliating” for the British prime minister, while France Inter radio described the defeat as a “coup de Trafalgar”, with the prime minister hit – though not necessarily knocked down altogether.In Italy, Enrico Franceschini said – with apologies to Winston Churchill – in La Repubblica that Brexit “has revealed itself as a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma: cancelling it would entail problems – but that could be the only way out of the labyrinth it has created.”In La Stampa, Stefano Stefanini warned that, without an agreement, 29 March “will be chaos. The risks extend beyond the Channel, where emergency plans are already being made for medicines and food. Repercussions would also be felt on the continent.”In Greece, the media was in rare agreement that the UK was in uncharted waters. “There is astonishment that a democracy as old as Britain has got itself into such a dead end,” commentator Pantelis Kapsis said. “It’s the sort of mess Greece would get itself into.”The Efimerida Twn Syntaktwn paper, which often reflects the views of prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s leftist government, predicted that while May would likely survive tonight’s confidence vote, the most likely scenario was an extension of the country’s exit date until July “in order to give London more time”.The conservative Kathimerini, in particularly pessimistic mood, said prospects for an alternative solution were far from good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23efa8e5b1168411f72ade5ccf12ccff95eb6dac/143_88_3244_1946/master/3244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd5879c51eb29e4e710cd4688bf44e87","title":"labour mps declare support for second brexit referendum","story":"Among 71 MPs signing up, six said to be backing ‘people’s vote’ for first timeHalf a dozen Labour MPs have declared themselves supporters of a second referendum for the first time at a hastily arranged photocall at Westminster, arguing it was the “the only logical option” if the party could not secure a general election.Debbie Abrahams and Lilian Greenwood, both former frontbenchers, were among 71 MPs who signed a statement saying the party must back a second referendum hours before Jeremy Corbyn was due to move a vote of no confidence.The statement said: “We must try and remove this government from office as soon as possible.” However, it added: “But the removal of the government and pushing for a general election may prove impossible.”In that situation, the MPs called on Labour to “join trade unions, our members and a majority of our constituents by then unequivocally backing the only logical option to help our country move forward: putting the decision back to the people for a final say, in a public vote, with the option to stay and keep the deal that we have”.Other MPs who had not declared support for another referendum before included John Grogan, Graham Jones, Stephen Morgan and Matt Western, according to the organisers of the statement released on Wednesday morning.Few expect Labour to win the vote of no confidence given that the DUP has said it will support May’s minority government. That has prompted growing pressure for the party to back a second referendum, despite the reservations of the party’s leadership.Labour’s repeatedly stated policy was to press for an election after May’s deal had been voted down, but then to consider a second referendum as an option if no election could be secured.But in his speeches in Tuesday night’s Brexit debate, Corbyn made no reference to a second referendum and his spokesman said that the party would consider demanding more than a confidence vote before accepting that it could not force a general election.Stephen Doughty, one of the organisers of the declaration, said the MPs were “supporting the confidence vote, we want to get rid of the Tory government” but called on the party to act soon.The MP refused to give Corbyn a timescale, saying the leadership had “good reasons” for taking its time. But he added: “The clock is ticking, therefore we have to move forward, because it’s jobs, it’s investments, it’s our public services that are at risk.”Other Labour sources closer to the party’s leadership said that there were only a handful of MPs who had supported a fresh referendum for the first time, and noted that the number who signed the declaration was well below the 100 figure that had been touted earlier.The organisers of the letter said that there were a further 24 Labour MPs who supported a second referendum who had not signed the statement for administrative reasons, or because their position was already well known.Other Labour MPs called on Corbyn to act quicker if the confidence vote was defeated. Bridget Phillipson said “in the event we don’t succeed in securing a general election we should commit immediately to going back to the people in a fresh referendum”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d61a769f4c4101f03fb773387650332518e0114/437_55_1493_896/master/1493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb8df4e284bb08e314d8c8c595d8aad5","title":"off the incompetence scale readers react to mays brexit defeat","story":"You have been reacting to the prime minister’s historic defeat and debating what might be next for BrexitMay has to go. Her incompetence is off the incompetence scale. A total failure at everything she has touched. She will probably try and continue as she thinks her obstinacy and failure is strength and stability.It would be funny if people’s lives and livelihoods weren’t at risk from her ineptitude. MrTiggyMay is a woeful failure on all counts. She has never demonstrated capacity for cooperation or diplomacy. The only way she knows how to relate to Corbyn is to issue personal abuse and sneering insults. It seems to be her default position – no wonder nearly three years after the referendum we’ve made no progress whatsoever towards a resolution. jessthecripAll this is madness. May says she’s going to talk to parliamentarians about what to do next, but didn’t reach out to any of the opposition bar the DUP?She still doesn’t get it. This is not a Tory issue, its a national calamity. Grow up. TintenfischeI’m incredulous at political developments this morning. May loses by the biggest margin ever – yet wants to carry on as if nothing has changed, and Andrea Leadsom hectors the opposition for not supporting May. Over a hundred Tories vote against May in their vote of confidence and in the vote last night – but will all support her in a vote brought by someone else.May says she wants to reach out to others – but just not anyone who has a differing view. I don’t care which side of the argument you are on. This is contemptuous arrogance. How can it be defeated? dougmeyberryI think we all know that a general election at the moment, with both main parties still aiming for a cakeist Brexit, would solve nothing. A cross party agreement requires that the Tories talk to someone other than the DUP – or that large numbers of moderates on both sides defy the whips. How likely is that? A referendum will only work if the question is definitive, and even then is fraught with difficulty – there isn’t even a deal to vote on, is there? nufubarMay’s deal is fully and finally dead. There’s no more negotiation with the EU. Within a week, we’ll also find out that there will be no general election and no superior Labour Brexit. Norway+ means we keep freedom of movement, which effectively means we bin Brexit. If we’re going to pay the political price for that, we may as well go the whole way and just revoke article 50 and Remain.So there’s only two viable options left: either we jump off the no deal cliff and commit national suicide, which no one voted for, or we put this matter back to the people. Anyone who disagrees with a new referendum now needs to explain why they don’t want to resolve this impasse democratically, and what else they suggest. UltraLightBeamBoris Johnson and others will all claim that there’s a better deal to be renegotiated, but the EU have made it clear time after time that they won’t support anything materially different. So now the reality is no Brexit or hard Brexit. No political party would dare pick either of these, so eventually there must be a re-referendum. UnevenSurfaceI was a fool, because when May was announced prime minister I was relieved. But she’s the worst we’ve ever had, and she’s too damn proud and egotistical to do the decent thing and step away from a job she’s not up to.Her deal, I will give her this, actually united the country. Nobody thought it was a good idea. Remainers hate it, because why wouldn’t they? It’s essentially a half way house that ties us to the EU but without the influence we have now. So what’s the point? Leavers, well of course they hate it, because it’s not leaving properly, so what’s the point?After all I’ve said about May, she’d still beat Corbyn, because people don’t trust him, so he needs to do the decent thing and step down as well. These are not the best Britain can do, they are merely the political opportunists who have found themselves at the top, and its patently obvious that we need better political representation. SummersgoneI was a little surprised and mildly disturbed by the pictures posted from the voting lobbies. It looked like the MPs were having a great time voting against the PM’s motion. The fact that our country is standing at the abyss with an uncertain future seems to me anything other than a joyful occasion.I would have expected a sense of urgency at the very least. Once again proof that we’re being governed by a bunch of jokers who treat this whole Brexit dilemma as a game. Time for the people to take back control and demand that people’s vote. It may not be in our veins to fill streets and squares in protest, but if ever there was a time and moment, this surely must be it. CozitMakesSenseWhat if there’s another referendum, and leave wins again? Chaotic – revolution rousing, possibly – as it plainly would be, isn’t there an argument for the Government now to say “Sorry,we have tried to honour the referendum result, and we can’t do it. We have to revoke the activation of Article 50.”Of course, it could lead to horrendous, maybe ungovernable consequences. Choosing the least bad option seems seems very difficult, and there doesn’t seem to be anyone in parliament who can give clear, non-partisan leadership on it. But that’s the responsibility they have signed up for. Time for them to show their worth (if any of them have any). oxymoronFor the sake of our future generation, let’s ask them. I see no other solution than another vote with remain as an option. All this time and money wasted could have gone into schools and hospitals. Safeguard our universities. Protect our environment.

Tomorrow is shaping up to be another dramatic day in the crazy world that is UK politics, as MPs vote on the no confidence motion proposed by Jeremy Corbyn. We will be back with all the news and updates. I’ll be launching an early-morning blog at about 5:30am, so get some rest, and see you back here in a few hours.As always, thanks for following on.Press Association has this helpful guide to the motion of no-confidence, tabled by Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to force a general election, which is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon.It is the first time the procedure has been used under the provisions of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act passed by the coalition government under David Cameron. This is how it will work: Mr Corbyn will move the motion tabled in his name as Leader of the Opposition and will speak first in the debate scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The Prime Minister will then speak for the government and at the end of proceedings at 7pm MPs will vote. If the government wins there will not be a general election and ministers will carry on in office. If the government loses, the Act states there must be an “early” election unless the government can regain the confidence of the House by winning a confidence vote within 14 days. During that two-week period there is no statutory limit on how many times a confidence motion can be brought forward and voted on. In the course of that period the opposition may seek to form alliances within the Commons to demonstrate they are the party most likely to command the confidence of the House and therefore should be given the opportunity to form a government.The front page of the papers are in and they are not good for Theresa May.The Sun has gone all-out, delivering a classic Sun front page. “Brextinct”, is their headline, as they paste May’s face onto a dodo.“Dismay,” says the Express. “A complete humiliation,” says the . “No deal, no hope, no clue, no confidence,” says the Mirror. Even the Daily Mail, which is usually incredibly supportive of the prime minister, can only muster: “Fighting for her life”.And while we’re on the subject, the agenda for parliamentary business in the House of Commons tomorrow is quite remarkable.Dominic Grieve, former attorney-general and advocate of a second referendum, will present two bills to parliament tomorrow regarding another referendum on the subject of “the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union”.This will happen sometime after 12:30pm.Nick Boles, the Conservative MP who has said he will do what it takes to stop a no-deal Brexit, has this dire diagnosis of what went down today.In a long thread, Boles – who earlier today tweeted that someone had threatened to burn down his house – said May “has approached the Brexit negotiation as if she commanded a majority of 150 in the Commons. She has conducted the argument as if this was a party political matter rather than a question of profound national importance of legitimate concern to all MPs.”He urged her to work with opposition MPs to reach a “soft Brexit like that offered by Common Market 2.0 – or what Michel Barnier calls Norway Plus”.Earlier tonight, thousands of people in favour of a second referendum marched on Parliament Square, where they watching the thumping defeat of Theresa May’s deal broadcast on large screens.The former Maryland congressman John Delaney has become the first 2020 presidential candidate to weigh in on Theresa May’s resounding Brexit defeat in parliament on Tuesday.In a statement to the , Delaney, a former businessman and centrist Democrat mounting a dark horse bid for the White House in 2020, said: “The truth is Brexit was never honestly sold to voters, which is why the UK finds itself in such a difficult position right now.“Leaving the European Union will, in fact, hurt British citizens, but staying is not an option after a referendum, unless they have a second.”Read the full story here:Good evening politics fans, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. After such a dramatic day and with so much about Britain’s future up in the air, I think Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, speaks for us all when she says:Huq has since confirmed the post was “unintentionally tweeted”, but intended or not, it feels like a tweet that speaks to the moment.The chairman and vice chairman of the hard Brexit-supporting Leave Means Leave group, John Longworth and Richard Tice, have released this statement:Quite rightly, MPs have rejected the worst deal in history. The PM should accept this was a bad deal and stick to her words: No deal is better than a bad deal. Let’s go to WTO and save £39billion and be free.The figure they refer to is that which the UK and EU have agreed the former should pay in part in order to honour commitments it made while still a member of the bloc.Earlier, we made brief mention of the reaction of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Here’s his full statement:I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the House of Commons this evening. On the EU side, the process of ratification of the withdrawal agreement continues.The withdrawal agreement is a fair compromise and the best possible deal. It reduces the damage caused by Brexit for citizens and businesses across Europe. It is the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening’s vote. While we do not want this to happen, the European commission will continue its contingency work to help ensure the EU is fully prepared.I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has moved quickly to quell business anger over the failure of May to get the deal ratified.All the main business groups, including the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and dozens of chief executives, were on the conference call at 9pm, in which Hammond expressed “disappointment” at the result.One source on the call said it was “constructive” that the “tone was realistic” about the damage this was inflicting on the economy. However, he was hammered by business leaders over parliament’s refusal to take no deal off the table.“This was the single biggest question he was asked,” said the source just hours after the CBI, the BCC, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses called on the government to urgently remove that option for the sake of Britain.Also on the call were the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. A source said:They were also asked about the extension of article 50 but immediately took that out of the conversation by saying that can only happen if we put forward an alternative. The majority of questions were round no deal.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is following the Labour party line that a second referendum should follow any failure to secure a general election:MPs have done the right thing tonight by rejecting the government’s bad Brexit deal. MPs from all political parties realised that this deal would worsen life chances and reduce opportunities for future generations in London and across the UK.What happens next will define our future for decades to come. It is absolutely vital that the prime minister acts immediately to take any prospect of a no-deal Brexit off the table for good. That means withdrawing article 50.We then need a fundamental rethink about how we take this crucial decision. The politicians have failed and, in the absence of a general election, the British public must be allowed to decide what happens next.We’re getting some more reaction to this evening’s vote and where it leaves us from senior figures in Westminster. The Conservative backbencher and former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, has told BBC Radio 5 Live:It’s a very strange experience to be a backbench MP and participate in a huge rebellion against the government that defeats it by such a substantial margin.But that’s a reflection of the fact that the House of Commons collectively looked at the deal the government has negotiated and concluded that it’s a deal which is not in the national interest.Now that’s not the prime minister’s fault in my view – we would have had a different leader and a different prime minister and we’d have still ended up with the same deal – the problem is the direct result and consequence of the Brexit decision.Any deal, I believe, is going to be an unsatisfactory one as viewed by the Commons. Either my ERG colleagues say that it doesn’t fulfil their dreams of what Brexit was supposed to be about, or people like me look at it and say: ‘But this is a third-rate future for our country and frankly we would be much better staying in’.I have always argued for a further referendum because I believe that it is the only way out and, in doing that, I am respectful of the fact that the electorate might turn around and say: ‘Oh no, we want to leave on the prime minister’s deal’.Many are looking ahead to tomorrow’s debate on the no-confidence motion tabled by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, following the vote. His party colleague and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has tweeted:Also speaking to 5 Live, the Labour MP, Stephen Doughty, backed a second referendum if the party fails to secure a general election, saying:Labour has a very clear position that was set out in our conference and agreed unanimously by our Labour members and backed by Labour voters as well, which is that we were going to vote down the deal if it didn’t meet the tests, call for a general election and remove the government.If that doesn’t go through, it is very clear that we would have to put this to a public vote.I actually think that is a much bigger thing than Labour policy. I think it’s the right thing to do because ... the reality is that people have changed their minds and have a right in a democracy to look at something, to look at facts and then to make a different decision.And Tory backbencher Paul Scully told the station:Clearly, it didn’t exactly go that well. The only good news is that it didn’t take me that long to vote.At the end of the day, what we need to do now is get through the no-confidence motion tomorrow, which I don’t expect to succeed.The prime minister has said that she’s going to speak to senior parliamentarians, to the DUP, to the Conservative party and see what will fly. Then she needs to go back to the EU and say: ‘Look, see, I told you so. There’s your benchmark, now you’ve got to actually shift’.The problem with speaking to Jeremy Corbyn is that, frankly, if Jeremy Corbyn actually had a plan, given it to the prime minister and put it to a vote, he would have still voted against. That all he is interested in is this general election.As Macron has hinted, however, sympathy among senior political figures on the continent for the view that the EU needs, for its own good, to accommodate the UK’s internal politics may be running short.Prior to the vote, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ chief executive, Mike Hawes, urged MPs to take no-deal off the table. After parliamentarians rejected May’s deal, he added:The vote against the Brexit deal on the table brings us closer to the no-deal cliff edge that would be catastrophic for the automotive industry.Leaving the EU, our biggest and most important trading partner, without a deal and without a transition period to cushion the blow would put this sector and jobs at immediate risk.No-deal must be avoided at all costs. Business needs certainty so we now need politicians to do everything to prevent irreversible damage to this vital sector."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3fbe0215bac5f30ee0519e197c3352f92b1be7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=76be49c488ec539b1bd955fa46fba13f 440w","title":"how did your mp vote on mays brexit deal meaningful vote","story":"MPs rejected the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement with the EU by a margin of 230 votes, prompting a motion of no confidence from Jeremy Corbyn.

Giving evidence to parliament in December, Newcombe told MPs that his arm was subsequently broken by a support worker in a restraint. “The arm was wrenched up behind his back until the bone snapped,” she said. “He was not taken to accident and emergency for 24 hours even though his arm was completely swollen.”Jamie spent a year in the privately run locked rehabilitation unit in 2015. These units are meant to provide therapeutic care on locked wards in the community, and support people moving from long-term inpatient care into their local area. Before rehab, Jamie was in psychiatric intensive care and then in a hospital-style assessment and treatment unit (ATU), having been sectioned under the mental health act at 18, when his residential care broke down.But Newcombe says Jamie’s care did little to help him live in the community again – and that the rehab activities mainly included being taught to cook and clean. She adds: “I visited every day and was allowed to take Jamie out … we’d go shopping or to the cafe, but inside rehab, he was restrained and locked away.” Newcombe, who co-founded the human rights campaign Rightful Lives to champion the interests of people with learning disabilities and autism, and to highlight cases where they have been breached, says local authorities and clinical commissioning groups use these secure units instead of finding adequate support for people in the community. “Locked rehab is a handy extra step in the system when you want to keep people locked up,” she says. “It’s a tempting alternative to moving people back to the community.”Last week’s NHS long-term plan included a new target to reduce the numbers in ATUs by half compared to 2015 levels (when there were around 3,000 people in such units). After the 2011 Winterbourne View abuse scandal exposed the reality of some ATUs, the government promised to move all inpatients into community-based housing within three years under its transforming care programme. That target was missed.Despite being designed for temporary care and assessment while long-term support is organised, many residents have been there for more than two years. Progress has been slow and latest figures show that 2,350 people still live in ATUs. And the avoidable death of Connor Sparrowhawk in an NHS-run ATU in 2013 underlined the failures in these units.Now, campaigners fear the looming deadline to discharge patients from ATUs, together with a separate government-commissioned review of the use of restraint, prolonged seclusion and segregation for people with mental health problems, a learning disability andor autism, will simply lead to more people being discharged into equally restrictive places such as locked rehab units.Last week, the Commons’ joint committee on human rights quizzed NHS England and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulator as part of its inquiry into conditions at learning disability units.NHS Digital figures show increasing numbers of people moving to places classed as “other” types of care(compared with those going to residential or community care, for example). What “other” includes is not defined, raising concerns about what type of care this is.Chris Hatton, professor of public health and disability at Lancaster University, says: “Without transparency, it’s possible to game the statistics to make the ‘transforming care’ numbers look good while consigning people to invisibility in places that feel very similar to inpatient units.”Lib Dem MP and former health minister Norman Lamb says the rush to move people out of ATUs risks creating a revolving door of discharge and readmission. This is because “you discharge people to inappropriate or unacceptable settings that don’t actually enhance their quality of life”.This was the experience of Alexis Quinn. Quinn, who is autistic, spent five months in locked rehab in southern England in 2015 after more than three years in an ATU, psychiatric intensive and acute mental health care. She calls locked rehab “an oxymoron”: “How can you rehabilitate someone into community life when they are locked up?” The CQC has previously warned against the use of locked rehab for mental health patients, while the Royal College of Psychiatrists does not accept it as a type of care. “The facilities appear to be defined by having a locked door rather than the specific type of rehabilitation service they offer,” says Rajesh Mohan, chair of the rehabilitation and social psychiatry faculty at the RCP.Residential homes for learning disabled or autistic people can be just as oppressive. Tom Richardson, 17, (not his real name) has severe learning disabilities and spent 18 months on and off in one ATU in the north of England in his early teens. His initial discharge to a privately run group care home failed as Tom found it overwhelming. After another ATU spell, he went to a small, private care home. He was the sole resident, there was an office by the entrance and some staff wore suits. Tom’s mother, Amy, says: “We were shocked. We felt that the care wasn’t therapeutic but focused on physical restraint and seclusion.”Tom’s experience shows a successful move to the community is possible, but there is an additional concern.While there is a new target to reduce ATU use in the NHS long-term plan, there is nothing to replace the transforming care agenda after March. Steve Scown, chief executive of voluntary sector support provider Dimensions, says: “Without such a central focus, who’s going to make sure we’re not seeing people being transferred into privately owned and managed long-stay institutions?”An NHS England spokeswoman says it is investing £75m to improve specialist community support for learning disabled and autistic people: “Treatment and care reviews are in place to ensure the right care and support is provided to help people live as independently as possible and close to their family and friends.”Back in Surrey, Jamie Newcombe is now living in a flat in a residential care development in Surrey. He is happy, says Julie, although deeply affected by his locked rehab experience: “When he’s anxious or upset, he’ll shout about what happened when his arm was broken.” Eventually, she says, her son hopes to move closer to home in London: “Jamie has a human right to a family life.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86136d58b9e361788c1857e6517c1584657c69e9/0_109_2834_1701/master/2834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c05161535f65603da645fa58b9c5be5","title":"aryna sabalenka wins praises katie boulter australian open tennis","story":"• Briton beaten 6-3, 6-4 in second round by No 11 seed• Boulter’s ‘really big hitting’ also impresses Annabel CroftKatie Boulter was lauded for a brave losing debut in the Australian Open, but it was equally obvious that players such as the powerful young Belarusian who beat her in straight sets, Aryna Sabalenka, will make life difficult for everyone on the Tour in the next decade or so.Sabalenka, at 20, is two years younger than her Leicester opponent, but 86 places ahead of her in the rankings at No 11 – and it was easy to see why as she struck seven aces among 26 clean winners to win 6-3, 6-4 in their second-round match on the Melbourne Arena, where Andy Murray bowed out on Monday.These two fine players have many years in front of them, and Boulter’s ranking probably will not linger around the century mark for much longer.Sabalenka said of Boulter: “She’s an aggressive player, plays down the lines, a lot of winners. It was hard to pick up the right corner where she’s going because she’s going, like, really hard and deep – really flat balls. Sometimes it’s tough to control them.”She added: “I’m so happy to win. She played great. Me, too, actually. It was really good match.” Her next opponent is Amanda Anisimova, the American 17-year-old ranked No 87 in the world, who knocked out the 24th seed Lesia Tsurenko 6-0, 6-2 in only 54 minutes.It should be an interesting match-up. The New Jersey-born daughter of Russian parents – a former US Open junior champion – is being groomed by the sports management group IMG as “the new Maria Sharapova”.Boulter, who beat Ekaterina Makarova in the first round, leaves the tournament disappointed but right to believe she can be in that mix. “I thought I stuck with her pretty well,” she said. “It’s encouraging for me to play someone like that not playing my best tennis but still be in there with a chance to win a set or two. I didn’t feel like I put my best game on the court. She played very well – it’s very tough to read her serve.”Boulter was being a little hard on herself, according to the former British No 1 Annabel Croft, watching the match for Eurosport. “Katie should be very proud of what she put out there against a world No 11. Sabalenka is one of the most exciting prospects on the Tour. Katie came out striking the ball with authority, really big hitting from the back of the court.”Jo Durie, a quarter-finalist here in 1983, agreed. “Katie’s run in the tournament will inspire her to get out there and work even harder on her game.”“This week has been massive. The past couple of weeks as well. My whole trip to Australia has been a learning experience. It has been really great for me. I have been surrounded by people I am not normally around. I have learned so much from just playing matches on big courts, which I haven’t done before. I feel a lot more settled out there. And I will definitely use it for the rest of my year.”Her two wins have added $180,000 to her earnings, but she will not be indulging herself. “I will be putting the money towards my tennis. You have to invest in yourself to get the rewards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b301c6ed6fdfc01bcd4996adbaba6e07e1eb774e/0_16_3846_2308/master/3846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ddb4175fa3e275c2d8a9c8d1b060ca5","title":"dan evans emerges from australian open defeat to roger federer with great credit","story":"A year after he found himself “in a pretty bad place” and contemplating retirement from tennis at 27, Dan Evans can smile again, bathed in accolades for three sets against Roger Federer that lit up day three of the Australian Open – and gave the loser much-needed heart.It took Federer two and a half hours to beat the world No 189 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3), 6-3 on the Rod Laver Arena, a place where he has celebrated victory in the first major of the year six times.None of that fazed the Solihull adventurer, a plainly gifted player who has survived the excesses of his own personality, including a nine-month ban for testing positive for cocaine. That pitched him towards the edge. This has dragged him back.As he said later, he was not remotely interested in his sport this time last year. He was still banned, and a nuisance to all around him, he admitted.“I had a good amount of people around me telling me it wasn’t as bad as I thought, and you come out of it on the other side. Hopefully I can kick on and get back to where I was.“I was at home in Cheltenham, just in the house – pretty much depressed, actually. I didn’t think I’d ever play again. It’s difficult times, like. I don’t know how I end up still having the people around me who were there. I was difficult to be around. I owe them a lot. That’s what you’ve got family and friends for. Hopefully, they enjoyed this week as much as I did.”Certainly the spectators rose to his heroics, even if, as ever, the majority were hoping Federer would not be dumped out of the tournament, or even mildly inconvenienced. Evans did more than that.Buoyed by three decent wins in qualifying, Evans played with freedom, “nothing to lose‚” as he said. He was two points from taking the first set in the tie-break but was over-eager in charging in behind his serve, dumped a difficult volley, shoved the next chance wide and the moment had gone. He saved two set points in the second, broke back with a brilliant backhand winner and forced a second shootout. The third was more straightforward but he tried all the way. Federer was impressed.In reference to the similarities in their method and tennis philosophy, from the one-handed backhands to the sliced returns, as well as their willingness to attack at every opportunity, he said: “It felt like playing in a mirror a little bit. My thought going in was that I was playing myself, potentially. I had maybe a little more size.”Evans laughed at that. “I think he meant in game style rather than level.” He was encouraged, though, by Federer’s praise.On Evans’s prospects of ever returning to a career-high 41 in the world, Federer said: “I didn’t even know his ranking. For me he’s a top 100 player. Once you’re 80 or 60 or 40, you can be all those things, and beyond probably. I just think it’s in the details at the end of the day.”He said it was in Evans’s own hands how well he did from this point of a most interesting career. “How much can you give to the sport? How much are you willing? Can you stay injury-free? Get your ranking up, be really there for the crucial moments? I think he can be top 50 again, no problem.”That was almost as good as a win. Almost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/627600bfd71623431c8b785eca1b6ae7e81a5cc5/0_164_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deb224f10c19bb0e0900e1e752323692","title":"gregor townsend names seven uncapped players scotland rugby union six nations squad","story":"Gregor Townsend has named seven uncapped players in his 39-man Scotland squad for the Six Nations as he seeks to improve on last year’s third place in the tournament.Three hookers – Edinburgh’s David Cherry, Leicester’s Jake Kerr and Grant Stewart of Glasgow – have been handed call-ups following injuries to Fraser Brown and George Turner.

It is a privilege for our players to be involved in the Six Nations, which is such a prestigious tournament and will be highly competitive once again.

It means that UK Athletics, which receives nearly £27m in lottery funding every four years, is now without a chair or a chief executive, with Niels de Vos having also left the organisation in the autumn.Bowker was appointed to replace Ed Warner in 2017 but quickly made enemies with his plans to make England Athletics and the other home nations subservient to UK Athletics – a decision which led to the 12-strong UKA members’ council moving against him.Many senior figures in the sport also questioned his lack of leadership and the direction athletics was going. His legacy also includes last year’s poorly attended Athletics World Cup, which was held on the same weekend as the World Cup final and Wimbledon finals, and reportedly lost over £1m.However, in a statement UK Athletics said the organisation had “made significant strides under Richard’s leadership” and insisted that he had “led the development of new strategies for key areas including talent development, competition and coaching.”Sarah Rowell, a current member of the UKA’s board and a former Olympic marathon runner, will take over until a new permanent chair is recruited. Insiders insist that Rowell is a highly respected figure and will work well with interim CEO Nigel Holl to steady the ship.“I am honoured to take this role and alongside the board am committed to ensuring the sport comes together to work to ensure that it is in great shape in the future,” said Rowell. “This means ensuring that the core at the heart of the sport – the clubs, coaches and volunteers – are best placed to support current and future generations of athletes.”"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube removes adverts for far right britain first","story":"Film in which leader confronts Muslim outreach volunteers shown before Brexit contentYouTube has removed an advert for the far-right Britain First from its platform, after clips promoting the group began appearing on the video-hosting website.The five-and-a-half-minute unskippable video was displayed before content relating to Brexit and British politics.It prominently displayed the Britain First logo and contained a link to the group’s YouTube channel.The advert showed the group’s leader, Paul Golding, and a number of supporters confronting volunteers at a Muslim outreach stall in Nuneaton in November 2018.The men accuse Golding of harassment and say they have called the police.YouTube removed the advert for breaching its advertising rules prohibiting adverts that promote hatred, intolerance and discrimination after being contacted for comment by the .A spokesperson said: “YouTube does not allow ads or videos that promote hatred, intolerance or discrimination on the platform.

Here are some of their storiesI am a seasonal Forest Service employee and making plans for next season and beyond. As long as the shutdown continues, I will not hear back from government jobs and I continue to question my faith in the federal government being a stable career option.The president runs the country like a mob boss and currently is holding part of the federal government on ransom. I have little hope he’ll do what’s right. This sets a precedent for Democrats shutting down government to fulfill any campaign promise as well. You may agree on this issue, but will you always? Brendan, forestry technician, Davenport, IowaI am a federal law enforcement officer. I have been forced to work without pay. I have now been sent to the United States-Mexico border for 21 days on a program called “Border Surge”. Every 21 days a group of federal law enforcement officers are being taken away from their families and normal duty stations and sent to the border to supplement border patrol operations. This is costing the American taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars a month and requiring officers to be away from their families for extended periods of time with more financial burden due to the fact they’re in travel status.I’m not a border patrol agent and I’m working as if I am. I am most likely going to have to request a furlough to get a second job in order to pay my bills. I pay rent to the government in the house they require me to live in. This is a terrible situation that’s putting a great deal of stress on myself and family. I feel like I’m being held hostage by my employer requiring me to work without pay. Anon, federal law enforcement officer, FloridaI am two weeks away from closing on my first home, something I have been saving for years to do. Now without a paycheck during the biggest purchase of my life, my finances are dire. I live on the border and see firsthand that a wall is not what we need, it is a huge waste of money and such a foolish idea. I do not support the wall but I need my job back.

Our role as steward of irreplaceable cultural and natural heritage is in abeyance – with all that entails regarding potential damage, deprived use and delayed preservation and community engagement. Anon, National Park Service supervisory ranger, Lowell, MassachusettsMy wife works at the IRS and has been furloughed due to the most recent shutdown.

We have three children of our own to support at home and this sudden removal of half our combined income has caused a great deal of unneeded stress on our lives.My wife has filed for unemployment and taken out a loan from her 401(k). We’ve taken my son out of daycare to save money and we will need to use all of our savings if that check doesn’t come. I tried to become a Lyft driver but my car will not pass inspection due to a busted tailgate panel that will cost $800 to fix. If we don’t get paid by February, I will need to sell my car. Tyler, teacher, Austin, TexasI work at the Nasa Kennedy Space Center and was furloughed a couple weeks ago. My last paycheck is running out and I only have a few hundred in savings, so I took out a loan at the credit union to cover bills. While I take responsibility for not having more in savings, which would have greatly reduced my stress, I seriously resent that my paycheck is a pawn in this political game.My fear is that if this goes on too long, I will start missing mortgage payments and risk losing my house that I just bought a year ago. I was homeless once and don’t ever want to go back to that.

They could be in the sea, they could be … But once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we’ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.”Ross responded: “Yeah, but I didn’t know what to say.”Coming under pressure during leaders’ questions, Varadkar said: “We are not planning for checks on the land border in Northern Ireland.”All Coveney’s remarks proved, he said, was that if you used the wrong words, or said things in the wrong way, “people will misinterpret that as meaning a secret plan and there is no such secret plan”.“We had a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. I remember it well during the Troubles … and before the single market in 1993,” he said. “I remember going there as a teenager. I remember the customs checks, I remember the 24-hour rule, I remember seeing soldiers, and I never want to see any of that ever again.”Pressed on how the government could possibly avoid mandatory checks on the border to protect the single market, Varadkar said that was for Brexiters who voted against May’s deal to sort out.“The only way we can avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is having an agreement on customs, common customs union and regulatory alignment and that’s what we negotiated in the withdrawal agreement and the backstop.”“We have come up with the solution, we have it in the agreement,” he said, adding that if Westminster opted for no deal it would still have to honour the border promises.His remarks come after the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, also claimed the border fears were exaggerated and that Ireland was refusing to come up with a solution.“For those of us who lived on the border and who were attacked by the IRA, we know that the IRA escaped across that border, so it was not a hard border, nobody wants to go back to that,” she told U105.8 FM radio.“It takes the will to look for solutions and the regrettable thing is the Republic of Ireland has not been in the solution-finding mode.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e94e7c4b3cdc435ecc07b7fac85a627645b96d9/0_63_3352_2011/master/3352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fc83efd40edf7d6ee9ec6d80ed1a9dc","title":"putin says us wants to assert dominance in balkans as macedonia changes name","story":"Russian president claims alleged increase of western influence is ‘destablising’Vladimir Putin has weighed into the row over Macedonia’s name-change, accusing the US and its allies of destabilising the Balkans by “asserting their dominant role” in the region.The Russian president criticised what he described as deliberate efforts to increase western influence in a part of the world Moscow has long regarded as falling within its own orbit.“The policy of the United States and some other western nations in the Balkans, who seek to assert their dominance in the region, has been a serious destabilising factor,” he was quoting as telling Serbia’s Večernje Novosti and Politika newspapers, according to remarks released by the Kremlin. “This will eventually increase mistrust and tension in Europe, rather than improve stability.”Putin, who made the comments before a visit to Belgrade, Moscow’s staunchest regional ally, deplored Nato’s “destructive” policy of expansion in the historically volatile Balkan peninsula. “We have repeatedly said that we see Nato expansion as a relic of the cold war, an ill-informed and destructive military and political strategy,” he told the papers.Last week, Macedonian MPs endorsed a landmark accord that will rename the strategic Balkan nation the Republic of North Macedonia in a move that now opens the way to Nato membership.The name-change deal, reached after almost 30 years of dispute with Greece, is expected to be ratified by lawmakers in Athens within days following a vote of confidence in the Greek parliament at midnight on Wednesday.The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, called the vote after the nationalist Independent Greeks party, the junior partner in his leftist-led coalition, pulled out of the government in protest over the agreement.Tsipras is expected to win the vote with officials telling the  he would probably bring the Macedonia name change accord to parliament in the coming days. Athens has blocked Skopje’s entry to Nato and the EU in opposition over a name it has long argued implied territorial ambitions against Greece’s own province of Macedonia.Putin, who begins his visit to Belgrade on Thursday, singled out Montenegro, saying its decision to join the western alliance in April 2017 had resulted in the country “now going through a period of political instability”.On Wednesday, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also voiced concerns over perceived western meddling in the Balkans, saying Moscow had credible grounds to question the legitimacy of the process by which Macedonia had changed its name.Earlier, the Russian foreign ministry had described the deal, known as the Prespes accord, as a western plot to draw the tiny state into Nato in comments that elicited a furious response from Athens. Skopje’s foreign ministry also responded saying: “The Prespes agreement does not interfere with the interests of third countries.”In stark contrast to Putin’s claims, Moscow has been accused by the west of rampant meddling in the region, including supporting an attempted coup in Montenegro in 2016 to thwart it becoming the alliance’s 29th member.Similar assertions of Russian interference in Macedonia have also been made by the US and EU, with both insisting that Moscow has waged a concerted campaign to stop the ex-Yugoslav republic joining Nato.Last year, the US then defence secretary James Mattis accused Russia of using money and influence to create opposition to changing the country’s name in a landmark referendum. Washington, he said, had decided to step up cooperation with Macedonia “to thwart malicious cyber activity that threatens both our democracies”."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"The first significant career choice you make will not necessarily be life-determiningRegister your details now \u0026ndash you can determine your final course preferences laterMany students receive financial help but preparation is key when it comes to securing the correct level of fundingAvoid the traps: Parents can offer vital support, but their knowledge is often outdatedWhat factors should you consider when deciding on what career path you wish to takeMultinational firms concerned over standard of foreign languages among school-leaversWe talk to graduates who made the wrong call when they filled out the CAO formTimeline for the 2019 college application processThousands to apply for courses ahead of this month\u0026rsquos application deadlineDownload PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach says post-Brexit proposals are \u0026lsquono longer contingency plans\u0026rsquoConcerns raised with Shane Ross about local authority\u0026rsquos reliance on north Dublin facilityCourt told Gerard Masterson\u0026rsquos life \u0026lsquoturned upside down\u0026rsquo after he hit ankle off shelf in Mace shopRay Martin giving evidence at inquest into deaths of 10 people in 2015 south Dublin blazeLoretta McSherry says she was knocked over after employee fell off ladder in DundrumJudge found he failed to complete 80 hours community service after admitting criminal contempt33-year-old told medics he used \u0026lsquoinnovative\u0026rsquo method to deal with back pain for 18 months\u0026lsquoWhen the dust settles we won\u0026rsquot have much change from \u0026euro2 billion\u0026rsquoActors, directors, designers have complained about use of co-productions and pay ratesDeveloping tools to identify most efficient cows among proposed projectsGroup linked to several incidents had originally been reported as bring from IrelandSammy Wilson says Republicans \u0026lsquocaused army checkpoints\u0026rsquo to be put in place\u0026lsquoI don\u0026rsquot think the EU is in any mood to agree changes to the withdrawal treaty\u0026rsquoGavin Whyte and another man filmed exposing themselves near Belfast City HallUniversity says oversight led to issue affecting students and graduates, with some owing \u0026euro9,000Patricia and William Maguire are living with their five children in emergency accommodation in WicklowDr Sheila Tinney was first-ever Irish woman to earn a PhD in mathematical scienceDublin calls on the UK to outline its next steps after House of Commons rejects deal"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3759273.1547586099!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit borderlands the irish times maps ireland s border crossings","story":"The Border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland has been the issue that has bedevilled the Brexit negotiations, one that has overshadowed the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.Against this background, and in light of the misunderstandings that surround the issue of the Irish Border, The  has brought together a volume of information that traces the lives lost in the Troubles, the Border crossings and the stories of tragedy and loss linked with many of them.This is part of what will be an expanding collection of material and research from a team of journalists setting out how Brexit will impact upon the lives of people on all parts of the island of Ireland – but particularly on those who live daily in the shadow of the Border.The crisis provoked by the need\u0026nbspto ensure that the Border remains “open” in all circumstances has come as a surprise to many of those who voted in the referendum on June 23rd, 2016.Since the Brexit vote, the issue of the Border in the negotiations has strained ties between Dublin and London and caused significant damage in the relations between the Irish Government and the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland.Indeed, it has encouraged many, or some nationalists in Northern Ireland, along with some unionists, to think more favourably about the prospect of a United Ireland – even if the Irish Government has continually insisted that it does not want decisions on that matter to be affected in any way by Brexit developments.The UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc, so unless some special measures are agreed, checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit – one as important to the EU as major crossing points in Eastern Europe.The 1998 Belfast Agreement – better known internationally as the Good Friday Agreement – laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions.Neither side, to be fair, wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace, with fears that a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remained fully aligned with the European Union’s customs union and part of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries.Northern Ireland would stick, too, to EU rules covering state aids and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules.The European Union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, initially insisted that this so-called backstop could only apply in Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applied to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The DUP also objected.Under British prime minister Theresa May’s current plan, the backstop would apply to the United Kingdom as a whole. However, the current proposal is still strongly opposed by the DUP and many hard Brexiteers.Everyone involved – Brussels, Dublin, May – has insisted again and again that the backstop is an insurance policy, one that no one wants to use.Instead, they emphasise that it would only apply if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic. However, these assurances have not dampened down opposition to the withdrawal agreement.Despite what some in the United Kingdom believe now, the warnings about the implications that Brexit could have on the Border were given before UK voters went to the polls in June 2016, not least by the then taoiseach Enda Kenny in London in January 2016 after a meeting in Downing Street with David Cameron.“From our perspective it would create serious difficulties for Northern Ireland and I don’t want to see that happening,” Mr Kenny declared later, speaking to journalists.Immediately, Mr Kenny was criticised by the Democratic Unionist Party and by some in the Conservative party, with DUP MP Sammy Wilson saying that Mr Kenny had been recruited by Mr Cameron to spread the “scare tactics of the pro-Europe camp in the United Kingdom”.Days before the referendum, Mr Kenny returned again to London. Before doing so, he warned that he could not see any way in which the introduction of border checks could be avoided if the UK voted to leave.“Were that to happen, obviously it means paperwork, it means administration, it means lost time, it means greater inefficiency, it means greater cost.“It would not be the wish of the Irish Government that there would be a restoration of customs and border controls, but that would not be in our capacity not to have it,” he warned.Now one of the key questions is what happens if the withdrawal agreement is not finalised and there is a no-deal Brexit. No side wants to impose border checks, but to avoid smuggling and protect the EU single market, the Irish Government would come under pressure to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe .A decision to appoint Fingal County Council as the noise regulator for Dublin Airport is an “almighty, massive somersault” and “dodgy”, Minister for Transport Shane Ross has been told. Under EU rules the appointment of a noise regulator was required before the commissioning of the proposed second runway at Dublin Airport. The regulator would potentially be able to set limits on take-offs and landings at the airport, particularly at night time, when the new runway opens in 2021. Mr Ross had previously said the “competent authority” for noise control under the Aircraft Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Bill (2018) would be the Irish Aviation Authority. But on Tuesday Mr Ross said Fingal County Council was “a better fit” than the the Irish Aviation Authority, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Commission for Aviation Regulation.He told the Oireachtas Committee on Transport that the Attorney General had advised “the aviation authority is not independent”. In addition, he said there was “legislation in the pipeline to break up the AAI”. “We made a decision on the back of legal advice,” Mr Ross said. “I can’t take higher or more compelling advice” than that of the Attorney General. Mr Ross said Fingal County Council was familiar with the planning process and environmental protection measures. He said the council was well placed to take public submissions, organise a transparent decision-making process, and include a right of appeal as well as a right to judicial review. He said nine new positions had been sanctioned within the council, which would be funded by a levy on the airport. However, a number of TDs claimed the airport complex contributes up to 20 per cent of the council’s income and had been paid tens of millions of euro in development levies by DAA (formerly Dublin Airport Authority). Robert Troy TD (Fianna Fáil), Imelda Munster TD (Sinn Féin), Clare Daly TD (Independents4Change) and Brendan Ryan (Labour) outlined concerns about the council’s independence from the airport. Ms Daly said the EPA had no record of even being asked if it was interested in the role, despite currently recording noise levels at the airport. “Approving Fingal is a pretty dodgy course of action to take,” she said. She told the committee the switch from the aviation authority to the council was “an almighty, massive somersault”. Ms Munster said the council was “reliant on the airport for funds” and “should be replaced” by the Commission for Aviation Regulation. Mr Ryan said he believed “the Minister has got it wrong” and he called on Mr Ross “to take on board” what the committee members were saying. Mr Troy said the runway was an important piece of infrastructure and called on the Minister to at least ensure a special directorate within the council was established to be “independent” of the commercial relationship between it and the airport.

Photograph: Liam McBurney for The .The hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland during the Troubles only came about as a result of Republicans’ actions, DUP MP and Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson has claimed. Mr Wilson said “the only hard border we ever had in Northern Ireland was a hard border which resulted from the actions of Republicans”. He made the comments after his party leader Arlene Foster claimed there had never been a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Wilson said Republicans “were the ones who caused army checkpoints to be put in place, army patrols, watch towers.”Tens of thousands of British army troops failed to secure a hard border, he said, questioning “how on earth” the European Union would be able to do so in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Ms Foster had said there was no need for a backstop - the name given to the legal guarantee that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal - and that there would be no return to a hard border in Ireland. The backstop has been a major point of contention, with hardline Brexiteers and the DUP opposing the clause.“As someone who lived through the Troubles, we never had a hard border,” Ms Foster said. “There were 20,000 soldiers in Northern Ireland and they couldn’t hermetically seal the border in Northern Ireland, so it is a bit of a nonsense frankly to talk about a hard border .”When challenged by a journalist that during the Troubles there was routine checks along border crossings, Ms Foster said: “I think you’ll accept it was for reasons of security and even then terrorists were able to come and go at their pleasure.”The DUP and a large number of Conservative MPs in the House of Commons voted against Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal on Tuesday as it was beaten by 432 votes to 202. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would table a motion of no-confidence in the Government, which will be debated on Wednesday afternoon before a vote is held at 7pm. However, DUP MPs, who are in a confidence and supply deal with the prime minister, and hardline Brexiteers who voted against the proposed deal are expected to support the government in the no-confidence vote. Commenting on the fallout of Tuesday night’s vote, Mr Wilson said he did not think Mrs May could command enough support in parliament to extend the UK’s departure date from the EU, currently set for March 29th. “A no deal Brexit will happen once we reach the 29th March, legally we will have left and if there’s no deal, then we have no deal. I don’t fear it,” Mr Wilson said. Meanwhile, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the onus was on the British government to propose a viable alternative to the withdrawal agreement.He told the same programme that the Government would not block any request from the UK for more time to come up with a Brexit deal, but there needs to be a plan for a “managed, controlled Brexit”.“There’s still a lot to happen in Westminster before it becomes clear what the UK is looking for,” he said. “We need to hold our nerve.”Mr Coveney added: “I don’t think the EU is any mood to agree changes to the withdrawal treaty. We will have to see what the UK is looking for. We don’t know what the British parliament will support. We need to focus on EU unity.”He said he had contradicted Minister for Transport Shane Ross at a briefing in Government Buildings on Tuesday when his colleague said there would be Border checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“If Britain leaves without a deal, well, then we obviously have to have difficult discussions with the European Commission and with the UK in terms of how we protect the EU single market,” Mr Coveney said after intervening while Mr Ross answered a question on the issue. Speaking on Wednesday, he said: “The backstop will mean minimal checks, limited checks at sea. I just reminded Shane that is the position which we support.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Nor are we planning for checks in the sea.” Photograph: PA WireThe Government is now implementing plans for a no-deal Brexit and they are no longer contingency plans, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has confirmed.In the wake of Westminster’s comprehensive reject of the withdrawal agreement, the Taoiseach said these plans provide for checks at airports and ports in Dublin and Rosslare. But he rejected claims by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin that there was a “private understanding” within Government that there would be a hard border and that they were refusing to tell the public.Mr Varadkar said the Government is “now implementing plans” for a hard border, and they are “no longer contingency plans”.He said: “We’re not planning for checks along the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Nor are we planning for checks in the sea.”Mr Varadkar rejected claims Government representatives avoided mentions of border checks because they did not want to be the Government that re-introduced a border on the island of Ireland, following a recorded conversation between the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and the Minister for Transport Shane Ross over border checks.Mr Varadkar said the only genuine concern is that “if you use the wrong words, or say things in the wrong way people will misinterpret that as if you have some sort of secret plan to impose a hard border”.There was no such secret plan, he said.Mr Martin said the Government “must be honest with the Oireachtas and the people” on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland’s politics, economic potential and social well being.The Government “should share all of its analysis” and all of its preparations for a no-deal Brexit.He highlighted what he described as a “deeply worrying” private conversation between Mr Coveney and Mr Ross, caught on tape on Tuesday, because it suggested that “the public are not being told the full truth for party political reasons”.At a press briefing, Mr Ross, answering a question from a reporter about checks on a truck from Scotland to Larne and then to the republic, said: “I would anticipate there would be checks”. Mr Coveney contradicted him.Mr Martin said when the press conference ended, Mr Coveney said to Mr Ross: “We can’t get into where they’ll be at this stage. They could be in the sea. They could be...but once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we’ll be the Government that re-introduced a fiscal border on the island of Ireland”.Mr Martin said there seemed to be a private understanding and knowledge within Government of a border but “at all costs that private understanding must not be shared with the public”.He compared it to a scene in comedy television series, Fawlty Towers. “Whatever you do don’t mention the war, but somebody forgot to tell Mr Ross.”He asked if Ministers were told not to mention the possibility of checks in the event of a no deal Brexit.Mr Varadkar said he did not know what Mr Martin was trying to imply, but he said a no-deal Brexit would “leave us with no guarantee in relation to there not being a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It would leave us with no protections around citizens’ rights and freedoms and it would have a major impact on jobs and the economy.”He said they had found a solution a withdrawal agreement agreed over months and months but Westminster had rejected it.Whatever Westminster came up with must be acceptable to the EU and to Ireland.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said comments by DUP leader Arlene Foster on Tuesday that there had never been a hard border were “manifestly not true”.Legislation to deal with Brexit will not be published until February 22nd and Sinn Féin would facilitate this legislation but “you’re coming to all of this very late in the day”, she told Mr Varadkar. She called for him to defend the backstop.The Taoiseach said “The only way we can avoid a hard border in the long-term is having a customs agreement and regulatory alignment”.It was not good enough for those who rejected the agreement to say there would not be a hard border just because people said there would not be.“I’ll defend the backstop but it’s there as a means to an end,” the Taoiseach said, describing it as a legal guarantee that mechanisms will be put in place to ensure no hardening of border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill The Government cannot shift on the issue of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar, speaking at Government Buildings on Wednesday morning in response the rejection by the House of Commons of British prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal agreement on Tuesday night, said the Irish and British governments had made a promise to avoid a hard border.“We can’t shift on the issue of there being no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland,” Mr Varadkar said. “That is the outcome that we need. We have said it from day one that Brexit cannot result in a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. We have made that commitment to the people of Ireland, north and south. “And the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom Government has made that commitment to the people of Ireland, north and south, so it needs to be honoured.”The Taoiseach repeated that the UK must now decide what type of post-Brexit relationship it wants with the EU.“What is required here is for Britain to essentially decide what kind of Brexit it wants.”He also rejected the idea of a time limit on the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border.“A guarantee with a time-limited is not a guarantee. What we are trying to achieve here is a guarantee that there be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.“There were two votes last night. One of the votes was on accepting the withdrawal agreement with a time-limited or deleted backstop and only 25 MPs voted for that.”Mr Varadkar said if the UK moved on its red lines of ruling out membership of the customs union and single market, the EU position would also evolve. “We have also always said that the risk of an unplanned, disorderly Brexit at the end of March can be avoided, including if necessary by an extension of the Article 50 deadline. This would be subject to a request from the UK being made, and agreed by all Member States.”He also said the Government “profoundly regrets the decision of the House of Commons to reject the withdrawal agreement between the EU and UK and the associated joint political declaration”. He added: “It is not the outcome we wanted. Over the coming weeks, the Government will continue to work with our European partners in a collective effort to conclude an agreement with the UK. The deal provides a guarantee that a hard border will be avoided, and that citizens’ rights and freedoms will be protected. “A No Deal scenario would have a deeply negative impact on jobs and the economy, particularly on agrifood and the traded sector - our farmers, our fishermen, our rural economy and our businessmen and women. A No Deal scenario would not protect the Peace in Northern Ireland. We will work hard to avoid it.”Mr Varadkar said the Government’s plans for a no deal Brexit will continue. “These are no longer contingency plans. They are being implemented by the Government. Now businesses and other organisations must do the same. “For Government, this involves legislation including the omnibus Brexit bill, preparations at our ports and airports for customs and SPS checks, contingency plans to ensure medicine supplies are not interrupted, and further plans to support our exporters, businesses, employers, farmers and fishermen who may be affected severely.”Meanwhile, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator has told the United Kingdom that it could have a different kind of departure deal if London is willing to change its key demands. Mr Barnier warned that the risk of a disorderly withdrawal was now greater than ever as a result of the vote and that the EU would step up its preparations amid concern a no-deal outcome could disrupt the whole of Europe. He indicated that one way forward would be for Britain to accept even closer alignment with EU regulations to secure a very close trading relationship in future. EU officials say London could, for example, abandon its determination to leave the EU customs union and the centrally regulated single market.Referring to statements by the European Parliament and all the other member states, Mr Barnier said: “If the United Kingdom chooses to let its red lines change in future, and that it takes this choice for its advantage of the ambition of going beyond a simple but not negligible free trade accord, then the European Union would be ready immediately to ... respond favourably.”That suggestion for a “deeper relationship” was echoed by the EU parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt. Mr Barnier and others lined up to highlight how the vote in London exposed only isions, without shedding light on what Britain’s could actually rally behind as a consensual position, just 10 weeks before it is set to leave the bloc, potentially into a legal limbo for citizens and businesses.“Please, please, please tell us finally what you want to achieve,” pleaded Manfred Weber, the centre-right leader in the parliament and an ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel.But, he added, there was “no room for manoeuvre” in terms of renegotiating the current agreement, which Brexit campaigners say leaves Britain too tied to EU rules, especially due to a “backstop” insurance clause intended to avoid throwing up a hard customs border across Ireland.Mr Barnier insisted there could be no weakening on that issue.“Right now it’s too early to assess all the consequences of this vote,” he told a Strasbourg chamber that was sparsely attended for the early morning debate, perhaps reflecting a growing weariness in Europe with Britain’s troubles.“We have respected and we continue to respect the democratic parliamentary debate in the UK and I will not speculate on the different scenarios. What yesterday’s vote showed is that the political conditions for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement are not yet there in London.”Some EU politicians have called for Britain to put the question of remaining in the EU to a second referendum. The chair of EU summits, Donald Tusk, suggested on Tuesday that ision in Britain could lead to Brexit being cancelled.Frans Timmermans, the deputy head of the European Commission, citing a phrase often attributed to British fantasy novelist C.S. Lewis, suggested Britain should put its past tribulations behind it and seek a fresh start with the EU:“You can’t go back and change the beginning,” the former Dutch foreign minister said, “But you can start where you are and change the ending.”But Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party which drove the campaign for the 2016 vote to leave, told fellow members of the European Parliament that any second ballot would deliver an even greater majority for quitting because Britons had been angered by the EU’s stance in negotiations.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

A sign nearby reads “Keeping Britain Trading”.Barron is concerned about the impact a no-deal Brexit would have on Britain’s ability to do just that at the busy port, a hub for freight traffic from Zeebrugge and Rotterdam. But he’s not concerned enough to change his mind. He says he voted to leave after a terrorist attack made him question immigration.“It made me think, hang on, I don’t want all these North Africans coming in through Europe, and I still don’t.” Which attack? Manchester, he says immediately. In reality, the attack at the Ariana Grande concert happened a year after the Brexit vote. There’s been “too much scaremongering”, he adds, but he’s talking about trade, not terrorism. “At the end of the day, people still want to buy products from the UK and products from Europe, so there’s still going to be that interaction.”Brexit is more complex than he realised, and he has sympathy for Theresa May, but doesn’t know what people expected with a Remainer in charge of the negotiations. Whatever happens now, he still wants out. “I haven’t swung to the other side.”Steve Petherbridge, who is here to have his truck washed, hasn’t changed his mind either. Like most people I speak to, he is impatient with the protracted negotiations. “They’re saying now we’ll stop in. We can’t stop in. We voted out, and deal or no deal, we’ll stop out.”Nearby, two Hungarian truck drivers are having lunch in the front of a cab. They are wary about talking, and don’t want to give names. “Brexit was a joke,” one says.Will a no-deal Brexit make their lives more difficult? “Actually nobody knows.” At the moment, one of the men says, there are not enough people manning the UK customs posts, and he doesn’t know where they’re going to recruit additional workers from. But he drives an ambient food truck, and long delays at the ports would be disastrous.In 2016, slightly more than two in three of this city’s 260,000 residents voted to leave the EU. More recent opinion polls seemed to suggest a shift in public mood. According to polls by the pro-referendum group Best for Britain last year, the constituency of Hull North is now 60 per cent Remain, a swing from 52 per cent Leave Hull West and Hessle, which was 67 per cent Leave, is now 54 per cent Leave. But if the people of Hull and the surrounding towns are suffering Leavers’ remorse, they’re not admitting to it.Kingston-upon-Hull, you quickly learn, is a place that defies easy categorisation. It has the dubious title of being the second most-bombed town in England during the second World War, when 90 per cent of its buildings were destroyed, and it still bears the scars. Here and there, examples of the remaining 10 per cent stand, relics of Victorian quaintness that are incongruous among the block modern shopping centres and offices. It is a once-thriving fishing port, which still hasn’t recovered its mojo after the industry declined in the 1970s – something for which many hold the EU responsible. It is also, however, the proud winner of the title of the UK’s capital of culture for 2017.The attitudes to Brexit are as hard to pin down as everything else about Hull.Anne Gorman from Galway, who has lived just outside Hull for 16 years in total and works in the National Health Service, loves the city for its warmth, sense of community and resilience. She voted Remain, and believes the referendum result here was a pushback by a community that felt left behind. “There is an objection to the large number of non-nationals that have come into the city over the last five years or so, but the main reason is the old guard feel neglected,” she says.Amid all the anti-immigrant sentiment from Brexiters, nobody answered the question of who will do the unskilled jobs that the English workforce don’t want to do. “There isn’t exactly a long queue of kids coming out of secondary school who want to go pulling the vegetables out of the field in Lincolnshire.”Outside the job centre, not everyone has heard of Brexit. “Brexit? Something to do with Europe, was it?” one young woman with a stroller says.Gary Ferrerby pulls up on his motorbike emblazoned with L plates. He reels off the reasons he voted Leave: because of immigration because he doesn’t trust politicians because “this country has gone downhill since we went in the EU” and because “it’s costing 20 odd million a day to stay in the EU”.Another man wearing a Hull City football club hat draws a link between Brexit and “the IRA bombing McDonalds and places because they wanted independence, and now they’re getting independence, they say they don’t want it”.Confusion about Ireland’s relationship with Britain and how it might be impacted by Brexit is widespread. Down at the port, Petherbridge reassures me that I shouldn’t worry, “nowt will change in Ireland. The British soldiers will still be there.”Later, in a taxi between Hull and the prosperous town of Beverley, about eight miles away, the driver, Nigel, voted in favour of leaving, and feels let down by politicians and the media. He admits he doesn’t really get the fuss about a hard border. “We’re all coming out, what difference does it make?” He is astonished to hear Ireland is not leaving the EU. “Why are southern Ireland stopping in the EU? Why are they not going with England?”Some of the confusion may be attributable to the fact that Hull has an Irish community that is tiny, and typically quite transient. A small cohort commute here to work weekly, flying in on red-eye flights on noisy turbo-prop planes via Leeds, and home again on Thursday or Friday.One of the fly-in, fly-out workforce is Dr John Byrne, who is in healthcare. Byrne says people in this part of the UK, “other than political anoraks”, are not energised about, or even aware of, the backstop issue. UK politicians, he says, have been guilty of not understanding what their constituents were thinking. The referendum vote was “a kicking”.But he thinks the chance of a no-deal Brexit is receding, particularly as people get immersed in contingency planning and the implications become all too real. “Apart from hardline Brexiters, nobody really wants a no-deal Brexit.”Peter Bartlett, a mechanical engineer from Leixlip who commutes to Hull to work on a construction project, is not convinced Brexit is going to happen at all. He’s so unconvinced, in fact, that he hasn’t bothered to apply for an Irish passport. He was born in England and still uses an English one. “They’ll get to the crux, and then they’ll back down. My prediction is that they’ll stay in the EU.”Eight miles north, in Beverley – a place of more obvious charms than its larger neighbour, including redbrick streetscapes and picturesque tea rooms – few people share Bartlett’s conviction. “We voted out to stay out,” says Simon Foster, out shopping with his girlfriend, Gloria Ashun. Neither of them actually voted, he clarifies. But if there was a second referendum, they would vote to leave. They want “out, even if there’s no deal”.They don’t talk about it with their friends, all in their 20s, anymore. “It’s been two years, or three years nearly. We’re sick of it,” says Ashun.Further along the street, Pip Seminara is returning home from having her hair cut. With an Italian last name, and three children who have plans to travel, her position is complicated.When Brexit happened, she had just bought a house and was worried about house prices, “so I very selfishly voted Remain. But when the Leave vote came in, I was pleased. I didn’t realise much how on the edge I was. I wanted to leave because I thought it was a really good opportunity . . . to make England great for Britain’s sake.”Her preference for Leave wasn’t about immigration. “We’re not trying to pull our drawbridge up, we just want to manage our own affairs, thank you.”Britain pays more than the other countries, she says. “No wonder they’re so pissed off we’re leaving – they’re going to lose our money.”She believes that if Britain goes, it will pave the way for other EU countries, like France, to leave. She is not convinced Britain will leave, but even if it stays, she thinks the EU will take “a hard look at itself . . . It’s an opportunity to kick them up the butt and say what kind of EU do we want.”But the Irish Border issue “is a huge risk. I’d never like to see a hard border in Ireland: the logistics of it, the money we’d have to put into it. It’s too sensitive.”Another man stops to share his view on why Britain must leave, with or without a deal. If Europe had been left as a common market, it would have been fine. “But the idiots over in Brussels tried to dictate our laws.”The woman with him doesn’t want to stop. “You’ve said too much. You’ve got verbal diarrhoea,” she says. Exasperated, as he keeps talking, she turns to me. “Why, if you’re from Ireland, are you here?”He has a last word before he allows her to pull him away. “I won’t trust the EU as far as I can throw them.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyHillsborough disaster killed 96 eight years after police averted another tragedy by opening pitch gates, court hearsArticle 50 delay: would it be possible and how long would it be for?What is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to negotations?What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

When sideways pressure is applied these tiny needles detach from the plastic backing, remaining under the surface of the skin. Made from biodegradable materials naturally found in human bodies, the needles slowly disintegrate while releasing a hormone, levonorgestrel, which has been used in contraception for decades. “The microneedles feel as if you’ve taken velcro and press it against your skin,” said Mark Prausnitz, professor at Georgia Institute of Technology and the corresponding author on the research paper. “Most people don’t find it painful – it doesn’t come with a strong or sharp sensation like an injection would.” Population: Prevalence of any method of contraceptionThe experimental technology was originally developed to provide an injection free way of administering vaccines, with rapidly dissolving needles that release the drug and disappear within minutes. The micro-needles were found to be just as effective as traditional injected vaccines in clinical trials, but were preferred by the vast majority of people involved. Trials to use the technology for diabetes treatment have also been positive. Now research published in Nature Biomedical Engineering journal suggests micro-needle patches can also be used to slowly release contraceptives. In rats, a high level of the contraceptive hormone was sustained for over a month. “There’s a real need around the world to improve access to contraception,” said Prof Prausnitz. “Long acting contraception is appealing as compliance is easier  for instance, you don’t have to remember to take a pill.But self-administered contraception could be of great use where women don’t have any access to healthcare, he added.  A larger contraceptive patch has been developed to use in humans, but not yet tested. As the patch remains in the early stages of development scientists are not yet sure of the cost, though Prof Prausnitz said that he thought it would be similar to existing birth control options.He added that he hoped the team would develop microneedles that last for six months, not one, which would further reduce the cost. But while the team are excited about the potential of the patches, it is likely to be at least five years before they are available for women to use. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Why Brexit is a living hell for Jeremy Corbyn... not just Theresa May Hillsborough disaster killed 96 eight years after police averted another tragedy by opening pitch gates, court hearsArticle 50 delay: would it be possible and how long would it be for?What is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to negotations?What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

At last, the endless miles of too-soft carpet, like ploughing through snow but with an extra helping of static, have been rolled up again.As shows go, this was a good one, with plenty of innovation, some stunning products and, of course, the nuttiest gadgets on the planet.The just-revealed products will arrive in stores over the coming months. Here are some of the best devices to look forward to.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis gadget manages to be both mainstream and quirky. It’s a wireless speaker (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) with a delicate, beguiling tone that is highly attractive.But it looks like something Florence Nightingale might carry because it has a glass cylinder growing out of it, with a light at its base.In fact, the glass vibrates and its resonance is what creates the sonorous sound.The light can even be set to flicker like a candle. It is perfect for romantic candlelit dinners, though it’s not cheap: £550.This was far from the only TV launched at CES but many of them seemed highly gimmicky: The LG rollable TV is plenty impressive and the Samsung 219-inch microLED screen called, appropriately enough, The Wall, looked just amazing.But for a TV you can actually buy without breaking the bank, the GZ2000 was revelatory. The image quality on Panasonic is routinely outstanding, and there were certainly improvements over previous models.But this is a Dolby Atmos TV, and the first with upward-firing speakers hidden behind the screen.In action, these transformed the experience, creating a deeply immersive sound, especially when watching sport. The roar of the crowd was no longer just coming from in front of you.Withings makes spectacularly good health products and its smartwatches appeal because they have analogue hands like, you know, a real watch.This latest model, out in the Spring, will include an ECG monitor, something only the Apple Watch Series 4 has, and only in the US for now. This will be rather cheaper, at £130.An ECG reading occurs when you press on the watch glass (there’s another sensor pressing against your wrist on the watch’s back that completes the circuit).The Withings watch has a secondary dial which shows how close you are to your steps target, too. Oh, and unlike the Apple Watch, this will be compatible with Android phones, too.This was one of the coolest surprises at the show and comes from Sphero, makers of spherical robots and a brilliant Star Wars R2-D2 toy.But the company’s toys have always had a considerable educational angle to them, encouraging youngsters to learn how to code, for instance.Now, with Specdrums, there’s a musical angle, too. Two silicone rings fit to your fingers and when you touch a colour, then notes, loops or beats will sound.The colours can be on the coloured pad that comes with the rings or things in the world around you. Very smart.Back in the seventies, Technics released a turntable designed for DJs. It was incredibly popular and highly praised because it was well-built, very reliable and easy to use.There have been updates since then but this is the first for almost a decade.The new model, in a cool matte-black finish, includes features such as the capability to spin the disc in the opposite direction and neat features such as a long-life white LED positioned to make it easier to see the stylus tip when you’re trying to place it in dim, or no, light. It goes on sale in around May for £900.CES 2019: Chinese firms and US government among conference no showsA smartphone with a flexible screen that folds out to become a tablet, this was a hot gadget in Vegas.But it will need to move quickly to work – Samsung has said its own folder will be out in the coming months.There are certain issues with folding phones, such as the aspect ratio. A regular display looks almost square when unfolded or, for it to look like a regular tablet, it requires a wider-than-usual display when in phone mode. But it’s a sign of the future.This comes from the company that made the Nuraphone, a pair of headphones that go over the ear and also have a bit that juts into your lugholes to deliver strong sound.The NuraLoop is an in-ear headphone which, like the Nuraphone, measures your hearing and uses signal processing to adjust the output to suit your ears, personally.There’s noise-cancelling on board and a social mode that lets the sound of the outside world out as much or as little as you’d like.A pet feeder is straightforward enough, but what if it had facial recognition? So Fido doesn’t eat Tibbles’ food, for instance.This is also useful if you have two dogs, say, with different dietary needs.Or, if you leave the Mookkie in the garden, you can be sure that a stray cat won’t sneak in and eat it.There are two food bowls with separately opening lids. It’s on sale in the autumn for around £160.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Studies have linked ractopamine with adverse effects in pigs, especially hyperactivity, trembling, and broken limbs.WTO rules could cut Denmark’s total imports to the UK by 17 per cent, the OECD found, resulting in a 1.3 per cent fall in GDP in the medium term. The UK is Denmark’s fourth largest market, accounting for 7.8 per cent of exports in 2017.Britain’s parliament is widely expected to vote against\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Brexit deal on Tuesday, opening up outcomes ranging from a disorderly orce to a reversal of Brexit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Therefore, specific transitional solutions are essential to at least somewhat ease the most detrimental impacts.In particular, this is about supplies of medicines in the UK.”Uncertainty around regulation after Brexit was the primary reason that UK-Germany trade in medicines and chemicals dropped in recent months, VCI said.\u0026nbspThe drop-off in trade has occurred in both directions. German pharmaceutical companies may have imported fewer UK drugs and instead signed contracts with other suppliers in Europe to replace British products in preparation for Brexit, according to VCI.We have seen the brutal reality of Brexit – time to revoke and reflectMark Carney warns of further market volatility due to no-deal fearsWhy prolonging Brexit plays into the hands of EuroscepticsCBI\u0027s chairman hails new Brexit era. But is it? The cost of customs alone is estimated to be €200m per year and VCI expects even greater burdens in the event that UK and EU rules begin to erge.A no-deal Brexit would also have significant consequences for the UK’s chemicals industry, according to the trade body.“In the event of a disorderly Brexit, chemical substances that were registered in the UK for distribution in the EU could be no longer simply sold in the European Union – with significant consequences for the supply chains,” Mr Tillmann said.\u0026nbspHe called on the EU Commission to prevent this by temporarily recognising registrations by companies headquartered in the UK.The warning is the latest to underline the far-reaching consequences of a disorderly Brexit beyond Britain’s borders.On Tuesday, research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that Danish food imports including bacon and butter could drop by almost a quarter if the UK crashes out of the EU.\u0026nbspThat would cut Danish GDP by as much as 1.3 per cent, the OECD said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Studies have linked ractopamine with adverse effects in pigs, especially hyperactivity, trembling, and broken limbs.WTO rules could cut Denmark’s total imports to the UK by 17 per cent, the OECD found, resulting in a 1.3 per cent fall in GDP in the medium term.

Therefore, specific transitional solutions are essential to at least somewhat ease the most detrimental impacts.In particular, this is about supplies of medicines in the UK.”Uncertainty around regulation after Brexit was the primary reason that UK-Germany trade in medicines and chemicals dropped in recent months, VCI said.\u0026nbspThe drop-off in trade has occurred in both directions. German pharmaceutical companies may have imported fewer UK drugs and instead signed contracts with other suppliers in Europe to replace British products in preparation for Brexit, according to VCI.We have seen the brutal reality of Brexit – time to revoke and reflectMark Carney warns of further market volatility due to no-deal fearsWhy prolonging Brexit plays into the hands of EuroscepticsCBI\u0027s chairman hails new Brexit era. But is it? The cost of customs alone is estimated to be €200m per year and VCI expects even greater burdens in the event that UK and EU rules begin to erge.A no-deal Brexit would also have significant consequences for the UK’s chemicals industry, according to the trade body.“In the event of a disorderly Brexit, chemical substances that were registered in the UK for distribution in the EU could be no longer simply sold in the European Union – with significant consequences for the supply chains,” Mr Tillmann said.\u0026nbspHe called on the EU Commission to prevent this by temporarily recognising registrations by companies headquartered in the UK.The warning is the latest to underline the far-reaching consequences of a disorderly Brexit beyond Britain’s borders.On Tuesday, research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that Danish food imports including bacon and butter could drop by almost a quarter if the UK crashes out of the EU.\u0026nbspThat would cut Danish GDP by as much as 1.3 per cent, the OECD said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It raises the chances of a \u0027no Brexit\u0027 or, at the least, an extension of Article 50, said Seema Shah of Principal Global Investors.Admittedly, the chances of a no-deal Brexit may mathematically have also risen, but the market remains ever-hopeful that the government will not commit an error of such epic proportions.But others suggested that the volatility was inevitable given the huge political uncertainty and the increased risk that the Government could fall.“A confidence vote loss is not a sterling positive international investors will see it as a negative for the pound given the uncertainty over the Labour party’s Brexit position and what a Corbyn government would mean for the UK economy,” said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst.\u0026nbsp“Sterling is living on borrowed time and could benefit from the government ruling out no-deal.”Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said that Ms May now needed a “new plan”.“Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer.

Air fares also helped push down the rate, with seasonal prices rising less than they did last year,” said Mike Hardie of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialTransport fuel prices were up 3.4 per cent year-on-year in December, well down from the 12 per cent growth rate in the middle of last year.No-deal Brexit will mean lost jobs and lower wages says BoE governorThe global oil price currently stands at $60.7 a barrel, down from $86 in October.The average price for a litre of unleaded petrol in the UK currently stands at 120p, down from a recent peak of 131p last autumn.However, the ONS also reported on Wednesday that core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose to 1.9 per cent in December, up from 1.8 per cent in November.The Bank of England signalled last year that it sees underlying inflationary pressure in the UK economy, despite the uncertainty over Brexit, which is likely to prompt it to increase the cost of borrowing over the next two years.But analysts said the latest prices data suggested there was no need for rapid action.“We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist – with expected lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive Bank of England action,” said Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.Inflation spiked to a peak of 3.1 per cent in 2017, mainly due to the record slump in sterling in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum, which pushed up firms’ import costs.Analysts have warned that the pound could plummet again if the UK crashes out of the European Union with no deal in March.Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, warned in November that one of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit will likely be another spike in the cost of living.Separately, the ONS said that UK house price growth was 2.8 per cent in the year to November, up slightly from the 2.7 per cent rate in October, but well down from the 8 per cent growth rates seen before the Brexit vote.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It raises the chances of a \u0027no Brexit\u0027 or, at the least, an extension of Article 50, said Seema Shah of Principal Global Investors.Admittedly, the chances of a no-deal Brexit may mathematically have also risen, but the market remains ever-hopeful that the government will not commit an error of such epic proportions.But others suggested that the volatility was inevitable given the huge political uncertainty and the increased risk that the Government could fall.“A confidence vote loss is not a sterling positive international investors will see it as a negative for the pound given the uncertainty over the Labour party’s Brexit position and what a Corbyn government would mean for the UK economy,” said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst.\u0026nbsp“Sterling is living on borrowed time and could benefit from the government ruling out no-deal.”Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said that Ms May now needed a “new plan”.“Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately,” she said.\u0026nbsp“This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders.

PIP is designed to focus support on people with the greatest needs and that’s happening, with 31 per cent of people getting the highest level of support, compared to 15 per cent under DLA.“As with any major new benefit we have been flexible and adapted our approach, and we continue to make improvements to ensure PIP is working in the best way possible.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They welcome Theresa May’s deal, but only because it is better than the “existential” threat that no deal, trading on Word Trade Organisation terms, would involve.This, for example, is what Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said on the eve of the meaningful vote: “As MPs prepare to vote on the government’s Brexit deal, we urge them to remember they hold the future of the British automotive industry – and the hundreds and thousands of jobs it supports – in their hands. Brexit is already causing us damage –\u0026nbspin output, costs and jobs\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspbut this does not compare with the catastrophic consequences of being cut adrift from our biggest trading partner overnight.”“A managed no deal\u0026nbspis a fantasy,” Hawes concluded.To understand the interconnectedness of supply chains, consider that some 1,100 trucks loaded with parts cross the English Channel every single day, to deliver their goods direct to “lineside”, for car giants such as BMW, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and Vauxhall.Brexit deal failure will lead to ‘national emergency’, warns CBI chiefToday’s factories are run on “just-in-time” principles – so any delay, and certainly delays of days or weeks, would cripple production, ramping up costs and shredding thin profit margins.For example, in its journey from a basic casting to its place revving around inside a new Mini Cooper S, a Mini crankshaft will travel from France to the UK to Germany and then back to the UK, and probably then back to the continent to be seen in a showroom. Stockpiling parts is old-fashioned and prohibitively expensive and unwieldy,\u0026nbspand disruption to production is intolerable. Sooner or later plants will be run down and volumes reduced to cut losses.Second, consider the position of Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port. With Peugeot having last year taken over GM Europe, of which Vauxhall was a part, it must soon choose where to place production of its next mid-sized models – the new Vauxhall Astra, Peugeot 308 and derivatives. With overcapacity, it has a choice to locate production – and secure jobs – in any of range of plants in France, Spain, Germany or the UK.The UK, particularly through Nissan, has worked hard to build up expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles. This will also disappear with the investment that will no longer be flowing into Britain. A promising growth industry is already doomedWith no certainty about the future of the UK’s relationship with Europe, and a need to concentrate production, Ellesmere Port, which narrowly missed closure before (a German plant went instead in an EU-wide effort to deal with the recession), is obviously threatened. Even Jaguar Land Rover is opening new production facilities in Slovakia. Toyota and Nissan (with its Renault alliance partner) could move new investment to the much bigger market in the EU. \u0026nbspThird, a no-deal exit will mean tariffs on parts and finished vehicles which will substantially add to admin and to costs. The UK exports far more of its production to the EU than the EU does to the UK, although Britain is a large and profitable market for EU-based firms. VW Group, for example, commands more than 20 per cent of British new cars sales\u0026nbspBMWMini is on about 10 per cent and Mercedes-Benz 7 per cent, meaning that about four out of every 10 new cars from German brands alone.For UK exports, adding 10 per cent to a car’s cost as it crosses the Channel would, again, destroy profitability.Last, the UK, particularly through Nissan, has worked hard to build up expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles. This will also disappear with the investment that will no longer be flowing into Britain –\u0026nbspand is already down significantly. Geely of China, which owns the maker of\u0026nbspLondon cabs, shelved a plan to build an electric van plant in the Midlands. Thus, a promising growth industry is already doomed.\u0026nbsp“Project Fear” for cars would proceed at slow speed. No one scraps a car factory overnight. The decline will be gradual, but inexorable. Makers such as Jaguar Land Rover, which\u0026nbsptend to export more to the US and the rest of the world than the EU, might suffer less and Rolls-Royce and Bentley (owned by BMW and VW Group respectively) might for the same reason feel less pressure but all rely on materials arriving from Europe, from engines,\u0026nbspgearboxes and\u0026nbspframes to\u0026nbspbraking systems and switches.Again, it would be relatively easy to transfer operations, even for quintessentially “British” brands. It would probably take five to ten years to relocate the auto industry abroad, much of it to EU bases in eastern Europe.After all, HP sauce, complete with its portrait of the Houses of Parliament, is made in the Netherlands nowadays. \u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Tory MPs want to put a time-limit or get-out clause on the policy, which is designed to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland.\u0026nbspSpeaking in the same debate, European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the question was not how to break this deadlock in the UK over the way forward.I know it’s not up to me as a humble Belgian to lecture the Brits on what to do. But I think it’s time now to tell our British friends that for the sake of Britain itself it’s time for cross-party cooperation, as we do here, he said, urging the different factions to come out of the trenches and build a consensus.Elmar Brok, a German MEP and ally of Angela Merkel, criticised Ms May for reaching out to opposition parties “two years too late”, adding: “Mr Corbyn has said that he wants a customs union – what he should do is get a majority for the proposal and, once that emerges, that will be no problem for us.”Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European Commission, said the EU executive “regrets the rejection of the withdrawal agreement”.“Nobody should be under any illusion: Brexit does harm. It does harm to the UK, and it does harm to the EU,” he said.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentQuoting British author CS Lewis, he hinted at the possibility of the UK staying in the bloc: “We can’t go back and change the beginning, but we can start where we are and change the ending.”Melania-Gabriela Ciot, the Romanian EU affairs minister who is chairing the Council of the EU, said of last night’s vote: “Given the many conflicting messages that have been passed in the UK before and during the debates leading to the vote, on all sides of the political spectrum, it is hard to single out one particular explanation of this outcome.”Speaking separately in Berlin, German chancellor Angela Merkel said: We still have time to negotiate, but we are now waiting to see what the British Prime Minister proposes.A spokesperson for the European Commission speaking to reporters in Brussels emphasised the difference between the political declaration on the future relationship and the withdrawal agreement:\u0026nbsp“We are always ready to meet and to talk, but the European Council in its Article 50 formation said in December that the withdrawal agreement – and I repeat, the withdrawal agreement – agreed by the 27 with the United Kingdom, is not open for renegotiation.”\u0026nbspHe added: “The next move has to come from London. There is nothing else we can do from here at this stage.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

Supermac’s had wanted to expand to the UK and rest of EU.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMcDonald’s claimed the branding of Supermac’s\u0026nbspwas too similar to its own and would cause confusion among consumers. The Irish company\u0026nbspis named after its founder Pat McDonagh, who is said to have earned the name “Supermac” while playing Gaelic football in his youth.In April 2017 Supermac’s, which has over 100 restaurants across Ireland, submitted a request to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) asking the bloc to cancel the US fast food giant’s\u0026nbsptrademark on “Mc” and “Big Mac”.Domino’s and KFC among fast food giants ‘forcing misery on chickens’Supermac’s accused McDonald’s of “trademark bullying” and registering brand names “which are simply stored away in a war chest to use against future competitors”.Lawyers for McDonald’s had provided printouts of its websites, examples of advertisements and packaging, three signed affidavits from its executives, and a printout of its Wikipedia page as evidence that it sells Big Macs across the EU and deserves a trademark.The EUIPO ruled that “the evidence is insufficient to establish genuine use of the trademark” on Big Macs by McDonald’s across the EU.McDonald\u0027s profits beat expectations thanks to its new Big Mac burgerUS President eats Big Macs, steaks and crisps on silver plates“Even if the\u0026nbspgoods\u0026nbspwere offered for sale, there is no data about how long the products were offered on the given webpage or in other ways, and there is no information of any actual sales taking place or\u0026nbspany\u0026nbsppotential\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsprelevant\u0026nbspconsumers\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspengaged, either\u0026nbspthrough\u0026nbspan\u0026nbspoffer, or through a sale.“Finally, as far as the relevant services are considered, there is no single piece of evidence that refers to any of the registered services being offered under the EUTM.”McDonald’s was also ordered by the regulator to pay costs of €1,080\u0026nbsp(£965) for the decision. It has the right to appeal. In the EU, trademarks can be registered both at a national and EU-wide level.Pat McDonagh, the managing director of Supermac’s, said: “The original objective of our application to cancel was to shine a light on the use of trademark bullying by this multinational to stifle competition. We have been saying for years\u0026nbspthat they have been using trademark bullying.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

But for activists, the battle is not over yet.\u0026nbspTheir wider goal, they say, is demanding proper asylum rights from the city council.\u0026nbspAlvaro, a member of the solidarity movements\u0026nbspwho is writing a PhD thesis on them, said there was a strong socialist spirit of “fighting fascism, real estate speculation and gentrification by tourism”\u0026nbspamongst what he described as “solidarity networks”\u0026nbspacross the city.\u0026nbspHe added that it is thanks to such communities that refugees and asylum seekers are able to find places to live, “otherwise they would be left on the streets”.He said the asylum application process is difficult for many because they do not fit specific requirements and many end up without a roof over their heads.Created with Sketch.

So we basically try to put them into the system so they can get a proper welcome.”\u0026nbspThe solution is temporary and this is why we held this protest. We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.The squat was one way in which they have tried to help newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees.\u0026nbspUntil two months ago, Barcelona’s “marginalised people” occupied the building, Maria says, but vacated it so asylum seekers could make use of it instead.\u0026nbspBut while the squat eviction has been temporarily suspended, the prospect\u0026nbsphas not been permanently banished. At a protest following the celebratory lunch, several hundred activists highlighted the limbo the squat’s residents now find themselves in.\u0026nbsp“For now, we are happy the eviction has been stopped, but we don´t know where they will go so we demand a permanent solution,” Maria added.“What can you do in the absence of state help? Just leave refugees on the street?\u0026nbsp“Every day we are receiving new people here. We are doing this, but it’s exhausting at the same time. And I think the officials are grateful for our work because it means they don’t have to do their job.”She says members of the\u0026nbspcity´s solidarity network met council officials, who agreed to send a mediation team to conduct a vulnerability report, leading a judge to halt the eviction.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.\u0026nbsp“It’s stupid to have people living here without these means because they will continue to stay anyway, so why not give them the chance to pay taxes and contribute to the economy?”Zac\u0026nbspleft Gambia in 2015, fearing for his life due to conflict between different political factions. He initially sought asylum in Germany, which was “not so friendly,” so came to Barcelona two months ago after hearing it was more welcoming to refugees. He has lived at Casa Africa since.\u0026nbsp“Since I´ve been in Barcelona, I have seen a lot of friendly, nice and very welcoming people,” he said.\u0026nbspHousing for asylum seekers is abysmal – things need to change now“Many of them are also struggling and it´s not easy for them to help, so we really thank them a lot.“It is also not an easy life to be a refugee and I have met many people sleeping on the street. I was told that if I see someone in trouble like this, to bring them here. I have brought maybe four or five people here, to the squat at Casa Africa.”Zac said he was granted asylum seeker status a week ago but still does not have access to a social worker, which he needs in order to find accommodation, and a job.“My dream is to find work. If I don´t have a home, I cannot achieve this, but hopefully this will change.”Ignasi Calbó, manager of the city council’s “Barcelona, Refugee City” plan\u0026nbsp(Barcelona – Cuitat Refugi) said all asylum seekers at Casa Africa are enrolled onto language courses and have access to legal advice.\u0026nbspHe said the plan’s “Service Centre for Immigrants, Emigrants and Refugees”\u0026nbsp(SAIER)\u0026nbspwas launched in 2015 in response to the crisis. Its website states refugees and immigrants are provided with information on housing, legal aid, social care and on learning Catalan and Spanish.\u0026nbspMexico agrees to take in America’s asylum seekersBut Mr Calbó bemoaned the lack of central government support, which, he says, “creates unrealistic policies, provides no resources to help refugees and simply does not care for them.”He said the council is appreciative of the work of Barcelona’s community of activists for helping newly arrived refugees.\u0026nbsp“It’s good to see how people are working to help people who need it, but we are working with the community to find solutions,” he added.“They help us and we help them to achieve their goals, like we have done with postponing of this eviction.”He confirmed Casa Africa was not an isolated case of solidarity shown by locals to newcomers.\u0026nbspMr Calbó said some 7,000 refugees arrived in the city in 2018, up from around 4,000 in 2017 and nearer 2,000 in 2016.But he said programmes to integrate and host refugees are expensive.Those who have found shelter at Casa Africa must wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay.However, for Zac, it has already proved\u0026nbsphow migrants need not be regarded with fear and suspicion, and can help benefit their adopted communities.“There is plenty of room for everyone,” he said. “People are just not given access to go and work and pay taxes. If they are given this, everything will be comfortable.\u0026nbsp“If you are working you must pay your taxes and that is what we want to do.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was possible to buy its handsets for some time if you looked hard enough, its first official move into the UK came last November with a highly attractive, innovative phone called the Mi 8 Pro.This week, its second flagship phone goes on sale, the Mi Mix 3, and it’s even more eye-catching. It’s a slider phone. No, not like those tiddly Samsung feature phones from the nineties, this phone slides only about 1cm, enough to reveal the camera hidden behind. Which, in turn, means the phone\u0027s front really is all screen –\u0026nbspwell, technically it has a 93.4 per cent screen-to-body ratio. Unlike other full-screen phones, there’s no notch because there’s no need to find room for the camera.I spoke to Xiang Wang, the company’s global senior vice president and head of\u0026nbspinternational business. We met at the Barbican Centre in London and sat in a corner that defined the eccentricity of the building, with sloping floors and corridors that narrow unexpectedly. I began by saying that this was a building that made a strong first impression and asking him how he wanted Xiaomi to be seen as it arrives in the UK.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I think the first impression of the brand should be that this is a cool company, very young, energetic and very cool, he said.\u0026nbspIt’s a very different culture and different product philosophy to others. That’s the most important thing we want to achieve.”There are certainly some differences that stand out from the start.

We were struggling to pick which one because we have so many,” Wang said.The new phone, the Mi Mix 3, was also a contender for being the first UK release. “It is another high-end model with a good camera, strong battery, new stuff inside. In the end, we went for the Mi 8 Pro because of its design with its cool transparent back, in-screen fingerprint sensor and so on. So, I think the UK audience may like it. We are also releasing a scooter, we think we picked the best, coolest products we have for the UK market.”Yes, that’s right, Xiaomi also makes an electric scooter. The range available in the UK includes half a dozen phones, a fitness tracker, a nightlight and a couple of power banks, but in China the products available are much more numerous. The plan is to offer a much wider range here, too, one day.“Through the Xiaomi stores we want to learn what the British consumer wants and needs so we can bring the right products to the UK. Now, we have just brought the hot-selling products from China and elsewhere because it takes time for us to do the testing and certification for the local requirements of each market. We think that in the future when we have a bigger customer base, we will have a better idea of what works for each country.”So, why is Xiaomi building its presence now in the UK? “I think the rationale is this. On 7 November\u0026nbsp2017 we had our first launch event in the western world, in Madrid, Spain. We tested the market and now we are number three in Spain. We work with all channel partners including online and offline carriers, including building our own Xiaomi stores there. The initial success in Spain gave us much more confidence for the western European markets. These are developed markets in which we had never worked before. Last May we launched our pilot service in France and Italy, in Milan and Paris and so the next natural step was the UK.”This may lead to different challenges, it seems. “The UK has a lot of technology innovations, plus art, fashion, and an energised younger generation. I think this could be a good place for us. There are also a lot of challenges in the UK because the normal consumer doesn’t know us. Those who do know us are engineers and the younger generation who have come across us on the internet. Also, in the smartphone world, the UK is still a carrier market, so we have to spend extra effort to make customisations for carriers. That’s another challenge. Overall we’re very confident.”When I met a senior executive at Huawei a year ago, he said it would be easy for the brand to be the world’s number one (it’s already climbed to number two, overtaking Apple in recent months, leaving only Samsung ahead of it). But that wasn’t the most important thing. What would be Wang’s ambition for Xiaomi?“Our ambition is not to become the number one smartphone hardware company – we definitely want to be one of the important and biggest tech companies in the world. But our aim is not just selling hardware, we are much more than a smartphone company. We build more products than that.”One of the standout features of the brand is the competitive price: Both the new Mi Mix 3 and the Mi 8 Pro are priced at £499, half the price of an iPhone XS. How is the company making the phone for that price?“Internally we are making huge efforts to improve operating efficiency. Actually, unlike traditional hardware companies, we do not spend huge sums of money on traditional marketing and billboards. We use social media and other channels to communicate our products. Basically, it’s word of mouth. If someone loves our products, they will tell their friends, family colleagues.”From 2018 the company set a maximum profit level of 5 per cent. If profit exceeds this, Xiaomi has said they will return the excess to consumers. “Yes, we did this already, last year. We gave coupons to our consumers which they can use to buy our products. That’s one way, which we did last year for Chinese consumers.”Xiaomi expects the range to grow in the UK, but Wang points out that there’s already something for every pocket.“Actually, we have the whole portfolio from the entry-level to flagship covered. We will gradually bring more but we understand we need to be focused, Wang said. The UK market is very different from others, there are still a lot of entry-level products but the high-end part of the market is very big. The phone network Three has been asking us to offer better entry-level products and we are doing that.In the mid-range we want to understand it better, we’ll listen to the carriers more.”It sounds like the company will see what works in China first, to get a clue as to what will work here in the UK. But Wang reveals that this may some day lead to products tailor-made for British tastes. “In the long run, once we have built more resources, we can think about products which can be designed specifically for the UK or Europe. But now we basically pick products from our portfolio. We have to do some customisation, for example the frequency requirements are a little different, so we have to add a band to serve European consumers.”This is now the fastest-selling smartphone in India- everSmartphone shake-up amid Samsung wobbles and the rise of XiaomiEvery phone manufacturer faces a challenge. Handsets have just become the same thing – a black oblong with a glass or metal back. How does Xiaomi differentiate?“The Mi Mix 3 is one way to stand out from the crowd. The competition is severe so we are competing on every front, for instance, design and material – the Mi Mix series was the first to use ceramic, as a unibody, the entire phone was built from one piece of ceramic, including the frame. That’s another choice. As for technology, we always partner with the best, for items such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor.”This is in the Mi 8 Pro, but not the new Mi Mix 3 which has a conventional rear-mounted sensor.Finally, how does he view competition?“I think competition is good – if everything is the same and we have efficiency, the cost advantage, from making it in China in large numbers, then we don’t need to make a lot of profit from the hardware. Other companies have a business model where they need to spend a lot of money on marketing. We don\u0027t do that, so our products are high quality but not high price.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But critics said the EU was giving us “diddly-squat”, withAfter Theresa Mays Withdrawal Bill was voted down by  votes to  in Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn called a vote of no-confidence on the government."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427557360.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"peoples vote second brexit referendum campaign","story":"There are now fresh calls for a second vote after Mays Brexit deal was trounced in Parliament. Heres what its all about - and wheThe campaign group was launched at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, London, on April , .Attending were the MPs Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry, Layla Moran and Caroline Lucas as well as Sir Patrick Stewart and the comedian Andy Parsons.Outspoken Remainer Lord Adonis was also involved.The campaign is a collaboration between several groups, including the European Movement UK, Open Britain and Britain for Europe.It is calling for a “final say on the Brexit deal”.The Peoples Vote organised a March For The Future on October  from Park Lane to Parliament Square.Organisers claimed around , people attended the march although the police declined to estimate the numberPreviously, the People’s Vote organised a march on June ,  from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square in central London.Attending the event were Gina Miller, Vince Cable, David Lammy and the actor Tony Robinson.Yes. The group wants to have a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.Labours Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said the party would inevitably back a second referendumthey were unable to force a general election, though leader Jeremy Corbyn has never suggested this.Arlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist leader, has said she and her ten MPs would not vote for a second EU referendum but did not rule out supporting a Norway-plus option.On December , campaigners delivered two petitions to Downing Street  - one called Peoples Vote and one called Final Say - with a combined .million signatures.And after Theresa Mays Brexit Withdrawal Agreement was shot down in Parliament by  votes to , the prospect of a second referendum is yet again being touted as a solution to the current problems.European Council President Donald Tusk also voiced his support, tweeting: If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly dismissed calls for a second referendum, despite backing the Remain campaign in the initial vote.She said giving in to the demands would be a gross betrayal of our democracy.The PM said the coming months were critical in shaping the future of our country,  adding that she remained confident that the government could strike a good deal.But in the event of a no-deal, Britain would be readywe need to be and go on to thrive, she said.The government, responding to one petition, said: A clear majority of the electorate voted to leave the European Union. We must respect both the will of the British people, and the democratic process which delivered this result.Campaigners looking to Jeremy Corbyn for hope will also be disappointed.He has also ruled out holding a Peoples Vote, saying he wishes to respect the outcome of the  vote.Although Labour appears to have no united position on Brexit, Corbyn said the party believes that a general election would be the best outcome for the countrythis deal is rejected - which it then was.A number of his colleagues, including Chuka Umunna, said Corbyn “would face increasing demands to hold a people’s vote by the end of the week”.Around  per cent of the Labour Party support holding another referendum, polling by the Economic and Social Research Council showed.In contrast, around  of the  Labour MPs are estimated to support the Peoples Vote - less than a quarter.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But whats he been doing since  Heres the latest.The man who triggered the EU Referendum has been hard to find over the past months, as his successor Theresa May gets a drubbing in Parliament.That was, until reporters tracked him down outside his London home as he was going for a jog.Speaking the morning after the failed meaningful vote, Cameron told them that he regretted the chaos sparked by the referendum result.But he stood by his decision to call the vote, a move that has been widely criticised by Remainers.Cameron, who campaigned to Remain in the EU, was able to escape the Brexit blues with a family holiday to Costa Rica with we Samantha and his family ahead of the latest January  vote.Previously it was said that David Cameron was back at home writing his memoirs, no longer playing a role in Westminster.According to a friend, Cameron fancies being Foreign Secretary in the next government - but his current unpopularity makes this extremely unlikely.The Suns sources said: David is dedicated to public service, and has often said he wouldn’t rule out a public role one day, domestically or internationally.“But he is only , and still a young man.”The Camerons have properties in the Cotswolds and in Cornwall.Their lavish Cotswolds cottage cost a reported £.m, while their Cornwall getaway was bought for £million last year.They also own a London home in Notting Hill.They reportedly took out a mortgage on the home just days before the EU referendum.Speaking to the BBC on January , , Cameron said: Obviously I regret that we lost that referendum, I deeply regret that - I was leading the campaign to stay in the European Union.And he said he obviously was sorry for the utter chaos that the vote has unleashed on Britain, adding there were dficulties and problems we’ve been having trying to implement the result of that referendum.As well as writing his memoirs, Cameron has reportedly advised Theresa May on how to break the Brexit deadlock.The former PM has lobbied Mrs May to put a string of dferent options to a vote in Parliament.He has teamed up with at least eight Cabinet ministers to argue for so-called indicative votes in the House of Commons.Mr Cameron told the PM she should get on with getting Parliament to work through the options, according to ITV.Quizzed on their talks, the Prime Minister said: He is not giving advice - the last time I spoke to him was when we actually agreed the withdrawal agreement.Mr Cameron has publicly supported the current deal, but its understood his priority is to avoid a No Deal outcome.He last wrote on his Facebook page on December , , urging MPs to back Theresa May after she faced a vote of no confidence.He said: I hope Conservative MPs will back the PM in the vote today. We need no distractions from seeking the best outcome with our neighbours, friends and partners in the EU.The father-of-four had also been due to publish his memoirs in autumn  but decided to wait until September  “to avoid his comments on Brexit undermining Britain’s crunch negotiations with the EU”, according to The Sunday Times.Cameron has enjoyed trips to Glastonbury festival, chowed down on some fish and chips at Polzeath Beach in Cornwall and sported a Peaky Blinders flat cap at the races.He has also been giving advice to we Samanthas designer clothing business.Aside from writing his memoirs, Cameron has also been involved in overseeing the expansion of the National Citizen Service , the skills programme for teenagers he set up while in power, as chairman of NCS Patrons.The scheme is open to young people aged between  and  and involves outdoor activity trips, where young people learn le skills and plan and fundraise for social action projects.Cameron will bring together politicians from all parties, as well as industry experts, to help it reach more teenagers.As well as being on the board of several other organisations, the rest of his time is taken up predominantly with the UK-China Fund, which he has vice-chaired since December .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this. Think about what it says about the state of British politics.The people vote in historic numbers to leave the EU. Yet the political class plot and conspire to make sure we do not.It is hard to think of another time in living memory when politicians have been so ­spectacularly out of touch with public sentiment — and so ­sinisterly cavalier about overriding our democratic wishes.There are honourable exceptions, of course. From Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Tory camp to Kate Hoey on the Labour benches, some MPs will opposeMay’s deal precisely because they believe in Brexit and plan to carry on fighting for it.But a majority of MPs fall into one of the two Brexit-phobic camps — whether it’s May’s “Remain by another name” or those who would stop Brexit entirely.Some MPs are terryingly upfront about their distaste for the democratic process and their disgust with us, the pesky ­electorate.In an unhinged online rant, Labour MP Clive Lewis branded Brexit a “racist endeavour” and said “we need to end it, now”. Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Winds will be rather brisk.And the snow could keep coming down for as long as a week.Richard Miles of the Met Office told The Sun Online: Where any precipitation falls there is a chance of it coming down as snow or sleet, especially in Scotland.So theres a possibility of snow on any of those days falling somewhere.On Thursday much of eastern parts of England and Scotland will see wintry showers and for many western areas it will be snow on Friday.There could even be a chance of snow on the North York Moors and maybe a few flakes in Norfolk by Thursday morning, according to John Hammond, chief meteorologist for Weathertrending.He added: By Friday, as a low pressure system spreads rain from the west, there’s a chance of it turning to snow over the Western Highlands, Cumbrian Fells and the Welsh Mountains.This cold spell is not directly related to the recent Alpine snow.Our cold snow is coming from the north, not the east.However, there are signs that later in the month and into February we may start to tap into some of that much colder Continental air.It comes after Continental Europe was hit by a once in  years big freeze as ten feet of snow brought chaos and at least  were killed.Wednesday - Heavy rain across much of England and Wales, with colder weather following and bringing snow over northern hills.Thursday - Frosty start with icy patches for many along with wintry showers, mainly in the north and east.Friday to Sunday - Cold with overnight frost, with rain and hill snow moving towards the southeastThe UK has dodged that Eastern chiller killer — but now a separate blast is on the way from the frozen Pole north of Iceland.Wintry showers set to hit the North of England and Scotland from Wednesday to Friday could also sweep further south along with bitter gales.The Weather Company even predicted a deep freeze of -C some time after the weekend.Brian Gaze, director and meteorologist for The Weather Outlook, told The Sun Online: The cold spell in Europe has been caused by an area of high pressure close to the UK blocking the flow of Atlantic weather systems into Europe.That pattern has opened the gates for very cold Arctic air to plunge southwards over much of the continent.During the coming days the UK will get a taste of the colder weather as the high pressure areas become centred further west in the Atlantic.In the longer term there is a chance of a more prolonged period of cold weather becoming established in the UK."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000462054269.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"goat meat food trend 2019","story":"BBC’s Good Food magazine has listed it among its top trend predictions for this year amid the clamour for “ethical meat”.Also on the list are wonky fruit and veg, meat-free food like Gregg’s vegan sausage roll and recyclable packaging.Supermarkets are testing recipes for goat sausages, meatballs and ready meals.Campaigners say around , young male goats are killed each year.This is because they cannot be used to produce dairy products, which are already popular, and farmers say there is not enough demand for their meat.James Whetlor, founder at goat meat firm Cabrito, said: “These products are in the final stages of development.“Finally people are realising it is right that goat meat should be eaten, as these animals are being euthanized and going to waste.”Currently, goat meat in Britain is mostly used in Caribbean and African food.But London restaurants have offered goat on their menus — including some of top chef Mark Hix’s establishments.He said it was superior to lamb.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To allow Brussels,it wanted, to keep us bound hand and foot forever in the Irish backstop, unable to forge our own independent trading policy.It would rapidly have become clear to the Leave majority that their decision, while nominally honoured, had been sold down the river. That we had not truly left the EU and maybe never would.More practically it all but guaranteed the collapse of the minority Tory Government since,it had somehow passed, the DUP would have withdrawn their support.The Government was always going to lose heavily. The discredited Commons speaker John Bercow ensured it by refusing to select any amendments to the Bill that might have helped narrow the margin of defeat.It was another low for a man who has already brought disgrace to his historic office by abusing his powers to help engineer the destruction of Brexit. Parliament will be a better place without him.But let’s not pretend it would have made much dference. The deal was fatally flawed.Mrs May’s response to the vote last night was feisty — challenging Parliament to find a viable alternative that could win a majority and honour the ­referendum. No one has a clue what that would be.And her call for MPs to “listen to the British people” was dead right.Outside Westminster, the public just wants Brexit done. They are aghast at the political games.The Sun reluctantly believes we must head for a clean break, finalise preparations as best we can and batten down the hatches.We never wanted a No Deal. It would mean a tough and probably damaging few months. But it would be the only solution left which defends what should now be paramount and most precious to us all: Our democracy — and the public’s faith in it.None of the alternatives does that.  They neither honour the referendum, nor are possible to sustain.They are all damaging in their own way. Yet our Remainer-dominated Parliament will fight tooth and nail to secure one of them and thwart a clean break, in direct conflict with millions of voters.The Norway-Plus proposal, however its champions spin it, is EU membership without the voting rights. No independent trade ­policy. No end to free movement.It is a short-term Remainers’ Brexit which would lead to only one ­conclusion: A new and irresistible clamour to exit properly.Another Tory idea is to lure Labour support by offering the permanent customs union they want with the EU, abandoning all thoughts of independent trade. It is a potentially suicidal idea which could destroy their Party and put Corbyn’s Marxists in power.Then there’s the toxic second referendum which would upend our democracy, shatter trust in politicians for all time and burst fully open our national isions.Its only upside is that Leave would probably win again. Plenty of the more sensible Remainers have seen through the EU now — and dislike the blatant unfairness of overriding a democratic mandate before it has been enacted.But what would the question be  Remain versus a deal already now rejected by a monstrous Commons majority as bad for Britain And whatRemain DID win  It is staggeringly naive to imagine that would settle it. Why should Leavers accept it  The wounds would never heal.Labour appears almost ready now to buckle to its europhile members and back that second vote — and its betrayal of millions of left-leaning Leave voters will finally be complete.Shadow Cabinet ministers are already teeing it up, laughably attempting to deflect blame by claiming Tory failure gives them no option. Don’t believe a word.The Tories have dedicated nearly three years trying to see Brexit through while Labour have tried to thwart every effort and their Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer has secretly lobbied relentlessly for a ​new referendum. Labour will own every ounce of the betrayal their working-class voters will feel — and will richly deserve the ballot box backlash.Mrs May has had the hardest task of any Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, trying to fulfil the Brexit mandate with no majority in a Parliament stuffed with Remainers, some colluding with the EU to sabotage her position.Even so, her handling of it has been a woeful failure.She is clinging to power by her fingernails. And only a fool would predict now what happens  to her, her Government, Brexit or Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and all were made public apart from two, which have now been seen by Sun Online.In one bombshell file, radar experts state: ...we cannot rule out entirely the idea of extra-terrestrial observation visitation, either covert or overt.“Our current policy to retain an open mind on these matters is therefore probably correct.In another  report MoD intelligence officers state: The only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not knowUAPs [unidentied aerial phenomena] represent a threat to the defence of the realm.We cannot eliminate the possibility.The files show how relations became strained between the open-minded Defence Intelligence Staff- the MoD’s intelligence faction - and the sceptical Sec department, which handled UFO policy issues.Following one meeting between the opposing sides, one member of DIS writes about a female member of Sec: ...she believes that all sightings are explainable“When asked on what basis of logic or analysis this had been done there was none.Another document reveals how Sec staff angered intelligence staff by only forwarding to them UFO reports they deemed credible.According to the files, DIS wanted to do in-depth research into the UFO phenomenon including going back through the archives and looking for patterns.The documents, which span the years  to , show Sec were worried about this, stating they had “some concerns about what is planned”.They were concerned that by researching UFO sightings, the MoD would contradict what they had told Parliament, which is that the UFO topic had no defence signicance and wasn’t being studied in depth.How are we able to maintain the line that the Governments policy is not to examine reports [of UFOs] further and that we have nothing to hide a  letter from Sec, included in the files, reads.Nick Pope, who headed up the UK’s UFO project - as part of Sec- was sent the documents by the MoD before their public release and shared them with Sun Online.He said: “These files show how dferent isions at the MoD were at war with each other over the UFO issue.“I had an excellent working relationship with colleagues in the Defence Intelligence Staff and because I had a high security clearance and the same open-minded views on the phenomenon, our positions were seamless.“Sadly, things broke down after , when I was promoted and moved to another job.“For whatever reasons, my successors clearly didnt enjoy the same good working relationship with the DIS that I had, and things went wildly off-track.“It was ridiculous for my successors to try to filter reports by forwarding only those they deemed credible, because they had no clue how intelligence works, and were clearly regarded with contempt by the real experts.“I dont knowit was scepticism, laziness, or even religious belief - some government officials oppose serious UFO research because they believe the phenomenon is demonic - but for whatever reason, some of my successors wanted to get out of the subject altogether.”Although the UFO project officially ended in , Nick believes the phenomenon is still being investigated by intelligence chiefs.“While they may think they won the battle in  when the MoD terminated its UFO project, intelligence officers dont stop being interested in anomalous sightingsthey think there are threats and opportunities in terms of technology acquisition.This is irrespective of whether they believe the good-quality UFO sightings are generated by foreign military aircraft or drones, exotic atmospheric plasma phenomena - or extra-terrestrial visitation.“Im sure theyre still looking at such things, but outside the scope of a formally-constituted UFO program. As seems to have been the case in the US with the Pentagons AATIP program, the UKs current UFO project is probably hidden by virtue of being embedded in an intelligence program looking at future aerospace threats.The documents are due to be released later this year and Nick hopes they will be placed in the National Archives as soon as possible, digitized and available free of charge so the public can see for themselves the dramas and disagreements the UFO subject caused. “This is a fascinating part of the official history of the most bizarre subject the MoD ever handled and I think people would be surprised, amused and intrigued to find out that MoD officials got drawn into just the same believer versus sceptic arguments about UFOs that one sees anywhere ,” he said. “The only dference was that the stakes were higher: the prize was the chance to set government policy on the issue.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000462085071.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit delayed 2019 amazon tesco no deal","story":"A new coup is proposing a shake-up that would force Theresa May to extend Article  until Decembershe cant win support for her EU plan, The Times reports.Conservative MP Nick Boles is spearheading the proposals after Theresa Mays EU plan was spectacularly dismantled in the Commons.He explained plans on his website, in an article called Stopping No Deal Brexit.Mr Boles wrote: Some of the MPs working on this are strong supporters of the PM’s deal.

Alfie was kicking the chair, asking him to move it forward.Waterson said no because he said he had to stretch his legs right out, Miss Williams said.She added: He had enough room but he wanted to stretch them out because his legs are quite long.He moved it forward once but only for a few seconds, only a little bit but it gave Alfie more room.Adrian just kept telling him to be quiet and they would be home soon.

five main possibilities for what happens next, including a second vote on the PM’s Deal, No Deal, a second referendum, a Customs Union Deal with Labour or the EEA option.THE likeliest option , as expected, Theresa May wins the no-confidence vote tabled by Labour.Most Tory MPs opposed to her deal want her to get back to Brussels to win more concessions — despite the EU’s refusal to re-open talks.One No source previously said the vote would be put back to MPs  times until they voted it through.Bookies have much higher odds of the PM getting her vote through on the second ask.This was fuelled by Scottish Secretary David Mundell saying MPs might reflect again on their “mistake”they get a second chance to vote on the Deal.Mrs May said she would start cross-party talks with MPs after the confidence vote.She said she would stay on and try to find “genuinely negotiable” solutions which she can take to Brussels.The PM has until January  to set out a Plan B, with the clock ticking on the scheduled date of Brexit in just  days’ time on March .European negotiator Michel Barnier said it was “time for the UK to tell us the next steps”.EU President Jean-Claude Juncker has declared “time is almost up”.JEREMY Corbyn was urged to back a People’s Vote by the end of the week — as furious MPs demanded he “get off the fence”.Sources claimed up to  of his MPs would today “pivot” to back a second referendum — and urged the Labour leader to back them.Labour Remainer Chuka Umunna told The Sun Mr Corbyn had to stand by the party’s agreed policy and support a second referendum “by the end of the week”.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer had earlier broken ranks and admitted a People’s Vote “had to be discussed”.Labour has so far committed only to consider a People’s Vote as an “option”the party cannot secure a General Election through a no- confidence vote.The move came as Ian Blackford, head of the SNP at Westminster, tore into Mr Corbyn’s dithering over whether to back a new poll.Speaking in the Brexit debate he told MPs: “I’m appealing to the Labour party — for goodness sake, get off the fence.”More than  MPs have publicly backed another Brexit vote, including former Tory ministers Justine Greening and Jo Johnson.Tory MP Dominic Grieve also supports a re-run of the referendum.Many Brexiteers — and Brexit voters — believe a “managed” No Deal is the best option for the UK because it would involve no £billion bill and the chance to strike global free trade deals.But those close to the PM believe she would never willingly commit to No Deal.There is also no majority in Parliament for it.MPs insist they will take any measure necessary to prevent it with some Tories saying they will resign the whip to vote against the Government.Last week anti-No Deal MPs voted in favour of a motion blocking the Government from spending money to prepare for No Dealit happened.More votes of this nature are certain to take place over the coming weeks.EUROPHILE Tory MPs have urged Theresa May to try and build bridges with Labour MPs.They were most recently joined by her Cabinet Remainers Amber Rudd, David Gauke, David Lidington and Greg Clark.The PM even put in calls to union bigwigs last week to try and get support for her deal.But the danger lies in the fact there are more Tory critics of her deal than Labour backers.Membership of the Customs Union permanently is official Labour policy.But eventhe PM did offer this — as not just an olive branch but almost an entire tree — it would infuriate Tories.And it’s not remotely certain that Jeremy Corbyn’s party would back the deal because their so-called six tests were always designed to be failed — and ultimately what theLabour leader wants is a General Election.TORY ex-ministers Nick Boles and Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Stephen Kinnock lead the “Norway Plus” movement saying Britain should consider joining the European Economic Area.It would mean being outside the Common Agriculture Policy as well as Fisheries, Justice and Home Affairs.But it would see the UK staying in the EU’s single market — one of Theresa May’s red lines.Big business would welcome it but Brexit voters would be unhappy as it would mean Britain accepting open borders and Free Movement of people and following European rules without any say.Supporters see a chance of an “emergency brake” on movement of people and some consultation on any new Single Market rules.One possible mechanism for the plan is a bill tabled by Boles Morgan handing control of Brexit to the Commons “Liaison Committee” of senior backbenchers. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies.

The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream. How do we know He told us all, on Saturday night.“I’m living the dream,” he boasted, “in a really cool penthouse apartment, in the centre of Manchester. Duplex, with a pool table.”He also told us he performed “baby-making music,” though the world had been surprisingly slow to acknowledge Dean’s “triple threat” potential.“I went to LA, Paris, Liverpool, as a choreographer dancer, and one day a music producer said, ‘You need to be the front guy’.“The next stage now is to release the beast of my showmanship and have my craft appreciated.”So, on Saturday, he unleashed it in the direction of the four Voice judges and, honestly, the reaction was almost perfect.Hardly a serious button flinch or a twitch or a hint one of them was going to bite. In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know. Close your eyes and you could almost be there. And s***.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “On a computer ­keyboard, the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”Gerry: “Up.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote Handel’s Water Music ”Lindsey: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What name links a chocolate bar and a ship on which a mutiny occurred ”Lauren: “Cadbury.”And Ben Shephard: “In which century did the Second World War take place ”Vicky: “st.”An epidemic of head-tilting right-on morons telling us: “It takes a whole village to raise a child.”Loose Woman Gloria Hunnord conjuring up a horric mental image when she told ice-dancing Saira Khan: “I worry about you when the one-hand job comes in.”And Icons presenter Chris Packham boldly comparing himself to Marie Curie and Einstein with the observation: “I’m a bit of an outsider too.”Though, just so we can put their achievements in proper perspective, neither Marie Curie nor ­Einstein ever got their own episode of Celebrity Cash In The Attic.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I believe in fat-shaming.

In total  MPs voted for the deal -  Tories, three Labour MPs and independents. A whopping  voted against including  Tories. Outside of the payroll vote, ministers and others, just  Tory backbenchers backed the PM. From Labour, Leave supporter John Mann came out for the PM after meeting with Mrs May and receiving assurances on protections for workers’ rights.

As did former Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd who quit his Remain supporting party to vote with the Government. The third Independent vote in favour came from Lady Sylvia Hermon who represents North Down in Northern Ireland. Remain-supporting former Chancellor Ken Clarke voted for the Prime Minister’s plan.  Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretaries Dominic Raab and David Davis all carried out their threats to vote against. Tom Pursglove quit as vice chairman for youth of the Tory Party to vote against the deal. The only MP not to vote without an immediately obvious reason was Labours Paul Flynn, because he is ill and away from Parliament.

The Prime Minister faces a vote of no confidence today after suffering a massive parliamentary defeat over her controversial EU withdrawal agenda. Labour launched a bid to oust the Government after Mrs Mays Withdrawal Agreement was overwhelmingly rejected by  votes to . Now Parliament remains fundamentally split over what form of Brexit would be best for Britain. But how do the options dfer   Despite the huge defeat the agreement may still be on the table in an amended form as Mrs May seeks cross-party talks for genuinely negotiable solutions she can take to Brussels. From the start of the Brexit process, Mrs May had insisted that she wanted a bespoke deal tailored specically for the UK and not an off-the-shelf model shaped around arrangements offered to other trading partners. The Withdrawal Agreement reached in November guarantees the rights of UK citizens currently living in the EU states and European nationals in Britain, settles the UKs outstanding liabilities to Brussels budgets for a payment of around pound billion and takes Britain out of the EU single market and customs union, the common agriculture and fisheries policies and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. It offers a -month transition period after the official Brexit date of March   to prepare for the new arrangements. Alongside this is a Political Declaration agreed by the UK and EU, setting out a common determination to forge a close future relationship in areas such as trade and security. If this cannot be secured by the end of the transition in December , the period can be extended by a further two years. If the transition concludes without a deal, the so-called backstop must be triggered, keeping the whole UK in a customs union with the remaining EU to prevent a hard border in Ireland.  If no alternative to Mrs Mays deal is agreed, the default option is for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on March . This would mean there would be no transition period, and iniduals and businesses would have to adapt immediately to new arrangements. The UK would leave EU structures such as the single market and customs union and would fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, which require tarfs on many imports and exports. Experts and businesses have warned that an abrupt withdrawal could cause chaos, with speculation over gridlock at the Channel ports, empty supermarket shelves, a collapse in the value of the pound and even aeroplanes being stopped from flying. But advocates of no deal say the warnings are exaggerated and the UK would benefit by being able immediately to strike new trade deals around the world. Brexiteers argue that the UK could save its pound billion orce bill by leaving without a deal, but this could be challenged by the EU in the courts.  The holy grail for some Eurosceptics is an ambitious Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU, removing tarfs from almost all imports and exports of goods, offering co-operation on standards and allowing mutual recognition of professional qualications. A Canada-style agreement would allow the UK to leave the EU institutions, end freedom of movement and strike new trade deals where in the world. Critics say that the model would severely restrict access to European markets for the UKs vital service industries - particularly the financial sector. But the options fans say services could be included in what they term a Canada-plus-plus-plus deal. Ministers warn that it would not resolve the backstop problem, as Brussels would still demand the North remains in the EU customs area to avoid a hard border.  Some supporters of a soft Brexit argue that the UK should take its lead from the members of the European Free Trade Association- Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland - and seek a close relationship with the EU short of full membership. As a member of the European Economic Area , Norway enjoys full access to the internal market for most trade in goods, but must implement the bulk of Brussels regulations without having a say in its decisions. It also pays substantial sums into the EU budget. Switzerland, which is outside the EEA, has a more remote relationship with the EU, based on dozens of bilateral agreements which must be constantly updated. The Swiss are required to follow EU laws in areas which give them access to the single market but make much lower contributions to Brussels budgets. Crucially, the arrangements do not cover services. Proposals for a Norway-style option often envisage a single market and customs union relationship with the EU after Brexit, but the Efta states are actually not part of the customs union. It is far from clear that existing Efta members would accept a UK application to join.  If the UK chose to abandon Brexit - either through a second referendum or by simply revoking its Article  notice of withdrawal - before March , it would retain its membership of the EU under existing terms. Trade with EU neighbours would continue to be free of tarfs and non-tarf barriers under single market rules, and UK and EU nationals would retain the right to work and settle in one anothers countries. The UK would keep its seat in the EUs decision-making bodies and hasty arrangements would have to be made for the election of MEPs in May. The UK would be subject to ECJ rulings and would continue to make contributions to Brussels budgets, currently running at around pound billion a year net, but the orce bill would no longer be payable. Future trade deals would be made as part of the EU bloc and not bilaterally. If the UK applied to rejoin after the Article  deadline has passed, it would have to go through a y accession process which would almost certainly involve giving up the rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, as well as opt-outs in areas such as justice and home affairs. It could be required to join the Schengen free movement area and the euro as part of the price of readmission.

Last night the Prime Minister claimed she would discuss a way forward with senior parliamentarians from across the House after her Brexit deal suffered the worst defeat in Commons history. She also promised to come forward with an amendable Plan B by Monday. But within minutes No officials indicated she would not rip up her plan - and appeared to suggest senior MPs could mean backbench MPs. Today Mrs Mays representative in the Commons stuck the boot in. Not only did Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom slam Corbyn - she also reiterated key red lines like refusing to rule out no deal or delay Brexit. Labour backbencher Yvette Cooper said she was making a mockery of Theresa May’s proposal for cross party talks.   The chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee added: PM has to accept she failed by  votes - she can’t just keep digging in. MPs in Commons bars were left baffled by the PMs response to last nights vote. One told the Mirror: Did she even notice it had happened  Ms Leadsom was questioned today as the government faces a historic no confidence vote at Mr Corbyns hands at pm tonight. She repeatedly rubuffed questions from the BBC on whether Mr Corbyn would be approached. She said: Jeremy Corbyn had the opportunity yesterday to put to the house exactly what his alternative proposals were. He clearly has none. Instead what he seeks to do is disrupt the country [with a general election]... He needs to come to the table and tell us what he wants to do.   Labour hit back on Twitter: Disappointed @BBCrtoday failed to correct @andrealeadsoms obviously inaccurate claim that Labour doesnt have an alternative plan. We have been promoting it for months: a new Customs Union, a close relationship with single market, no race to the bottom on rights. Ms Leadsom indicated the government STILL isnt ruling out a no deal Brexit, despite a vast majority of MPs being against it. She said: No deal is better than a bad deal and of course its still the legal default.   She rejected suggestions that the government could delay Brexit . She said: “We’re clear we won’t be delaying Article , we won’t be revoking it and we are determined to deliver on Brexit on the th of March. That’s what we are seeking to do.” And she indicated Theresa May is trying simply to re-work her existing deal with the EU.  She said: The prime minister will then not necessarily be looking for brand new ideas that no one has thought of before, but actually seeking a consensus, actually a fresh initiative to find a solution that is negotiable with the European Union and that would command a majority in the House of Commons. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said today he and Mr Corbyn have not been approached for talks. And after Number  made clear that Theresa May remained committed to securing an independent trade policy after Britain leaves the EU, he warned she was in danger of negating any talks before they started.  She is now laying conditions down about those discussions which look as though they will prevent any discussion of a permanent customs union, he told BBC Radio s Today programme. That is what most of the other opposition parties support so she seems to be negating the discussions before they have even started. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn left his home in Islington, north London, at around .am.  He refused to answer questions from reporters on whether the vote of no confidence is a distraction orhe will win it, and simply wished everyone a good morning. Meanwhile with just  days left to Brexit, EU chiefs have demanded she make the next move. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned: I dont think the EU is in any mood to change the Withdrawal Agreement signicantly at all. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this morning told MEPs he will respond favourably - but onlyBritish red lines change.

And Jeremy Corbyn has decided to test that theory - by tabling a motion of no confidence. Heres everything you need to know about what will happen and when - and whos likely to win. What is a no confidence vote in the government   A no confidence vote is the main way of toppling the government of the day. It involves all MPs voting on a motion in the House of Commons that says they have confidence or no confidence in Her Majestys Government. Since  there has been a specic system for the main type of no confidence vote. How does a vote of no confidence work  Jeremy Corbyn tabled the motion last night, and Theresa May agreed for it to be debated today.Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, a no confidence motion is passed like any other vote in the Commons - by a simplemajority.That meansLabour , the SNP , smaller parties, Mays DUP allies and a small clutch of Tories team up, they can pass one.If this vote is passed, it starts a -day countdown clock to the governments doom. The PM can stay in office for these  days. But they must win a second vote with support from at least half of MPs within two weeks, otherwise a general election is triggered automatically. Other MPs can try and hold and win this vote too - but they would all need to win the support of half the House too. If its still deadlocked, we get a general election.   What time will the vote take place  Tonights vote will take place at around pm, with the result expected at around .pm. Will Theresa Mays government win a vote of no confidence   Quite possibly.That is because her DUP allies have indicated they will not side with Labour against her - unless her Brexit dealpasses.Labour are saying theyll force a no confidence voteTheresa Mays deal isdefeated. So its quite possible the DUP will side with the government or abstain. Without the DUP against her, it will be quite easy for Mrs May to survive. Would Theresa May be forced to resign  Legally, no. But the political pressure might well be too greatshe lost the vote.  Yes.Unlike a Tory leadership challenge, which can only be called once a year, Jeremy Corbyn can call multiple no confidence votes. He can even call a second no confidence vote a day after the first one fails.But this would be politically damaging because Labour could be accused of crying wolf. And insiders argue multiple votes would stretch the convention that they are only used when really necessary. Despite this, a spokesman for the leader refused to rule out multiple votes and Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said: If we dont win this no confidence vote this time, then we can bring it again and again and againnecessary.  Technically yes. If the Conservative Party finds a way of winning round enough MPs in the -day period, there is no general election. So the government could cling on , for example, the DUP side with Labour in a no confidence vote - but only to remove Theresa May as leader. DUP MPs may then back the government again within  days on the promise that May is leaving and a leadership election is under way. Eventhere is a general election, the Tories might just win and get back into office. Is it the same as a TORY no confidence vote   No. This is a completely dferent process. A Tory leadership challenge is triggered by  Tory MPs submitting letters to the chair of the backbench  Committee. Unlike government no confidence votes, which can be called multiple times , Tory no confidence votes can only be called once a year. Because Theresa May survived a Tory no confidence vote in December, another cant be called until December .  Technically yes, but the road to this is unclear. Its thought it would need the Leader of the Opposition to be sent for by the Queen to try and command support. There is no duty for this to happen automatically. And Labour have been clear their preference is to force a general election which could easily happen by letting the clock run out. Is there any other way to have a no confidence vote  Yes. The Commons Constitution Committee has decreed that the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act is NOT the only way to hold a confidence vote. If the government makes something a confidence issue, theres no -day clock - but its still treated as a confidence vote all the same. In both cases, the government either has to give up and allow a general election, or to retain the confidence of the House through a further, second vote.

Because the long-demanded meaningful vote Parliament had last night has managed the momentous change of putting us in precisely the same position as before, with the same problems and the same Prime Minister whos been cocking things up the same way for ages. Its all very well for  Tory MPs to rebel against Theresa Mays Brexit plan, but their failure to rebel properly before Christmas means her leadership is safe for another year. Jeremy Corbyn can call a no confidence vote, but all those who dont have confidence in HER have even less confidence in HIM, so will find enough confidence to vote for Theresa. The current Corbyn plan is apparently to keep calling no confidence votes until she loses. Which requires two thirds of the House of Commons to become more confident in a man who keeps doing the same thing without success: otherwise known as not happening.  And when we have no plan for Brexit, no change in leadership, no general election and absolutely no idea how to get agreement on a thing we havent been able to agree on for , years, a growing number of people will look about them and say: Well, bugger me. What was the point of all this  Theres talk of renegotiation, guarantees, widdly bits and doodahs on the deal, Parliamentary process and amendments and a second referendum. If you were a used car salesman and someone was having this kind of inter-family chaos on the forecourt, you wouldnt drop your price. And nor will the EU. Its impossible to guarantee something in the future, doodahs diddle nobody, andyou threw an indecisive vote back to a public so indecisive they could only decide on  out of the last  governments, you would get, guess what, an indecisive result.  Now, everything staying pretty much the same is by definition what a Conservative is all about. But its the opposite of what Brexit is supposed to be, which is why a change is demanded. You wont get a Conservative to change - not their minds, not their shoes, not the country. That inescapable personality trait, combined with inbred laziness, is probably why David Cameron ditched his harness the morning after the referendum and stuck his head deep in a nosebag. Labour LIKES changing things. Which is why youll never get Tories voting for a motion of no confidence that could get Labour in power.  But Article  has been activated. The date of March  has been set in stone as the point when EU law ceases to apply. Surely, some say, this means we are exiting without a deal under World Trade Organisation rules in just  weeks  Well, no. Because Article  may be unilaterally revoked, or delayed with the agreement of the EU, which it has already offered. No deal would be so economically disastrous that no PM would ever allow it to become their legacy and no party would survive the century of loathing it would cause. More importantly, theres not a majority for it in Parliament or the country. And also because things carved in stone are eminently smashable. Look, ye, upon Section of the European UnionAct :  Quite simply: a minister can rewrite the leaving date, without asking Parliament. Theresa has said shell never revoke Article  - she could, nevertheless, change the date. If no deal looks imminent, this is the only sensible option. WTO rules would require a hard border in Northern Ireland, % tarfs on food exports to the EU, and dont cover financial services or air transport. Sorry, wingnuts, but WTO wont happen even under a PM with their head screwed on against the thread. All talk of deadlines is just that - a ploy to force things through a democratic bottleneck, when everyone at the table knew the target date was just a guideline. But nothing is impossible. There are  fundamental problems with Brexit, and therefore  possible ways through it. . Get rid of Northern Ireland  Its the political demands of this troublesome province which caused most of the Tory rebellions. The only way of fixing it is either a come up with a solution for Northern Irelands relationship to the UK which has evaded our finest minds for centuries or b get rid of it. The problem is Northern Ireland doesnt want to be got rid of. The Republic of Ireland doesnt want it back, either. And there are .m British citizens living there who,they decided not to start bombing stuff again, would have the right to move to the mainland. We could always build them a city in David Camerons Oxfordshire garden, but the planning appeals would probably drag. In other words, were stuck with it. . Produce unicorn The PM therefore must present a way of leaving the customs union and single market without the economy noticing, then take back control of our borders without building a wall along any of them, and finally limit immigration while not looking racist and letting plenty of migrants in for the economys sake. A professor of astrophysics would have dficulty figuring that out seeing as its Theresa Mays job for at least the next year, theres more chance of Nigel Farage being voted Miss World. . Get a better deal  Theresa May has  days to come up with Plan B, which will almost certainly involve asking the used car salesman for a lower price. The Labour policy is also to renegotiate, promising a customs unionthe EU will throw in a set of new mudflaps. There is, however, an even better deal possible. This is one that includes  trade deals ready to go, zero tarfs, border co-operation, democratic involvement in the creation of rules, regulations and budgets, and   cashback on our membership fees. It guarantees the supply of medicines, international police databases, farm subsidies, a happy Northern Ireland and that thing that Conservatives love best - continuity. With the same PM, the same party of government, the same indecisive electorate and the same immutable economic needs, that deal is the best we can ever hope to get. The change that is demanded, and which wont be long now, is the point at which enough people realise the bleeding obvious.

With just  days left to Brexit, Theresa May has promised cross-party talks to find a way forward and amend her -page plan. But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said this morning: I dont think the EU is in any mood to change the Withdrawal Agreement signicantly at all. We dont even know what the ask is, well have to wait and see what theyre asking for. French president Emmanuel Macron insisted that Brussels was not prepared to move much further.He said the EU would look into improving the deal but suggested it had already reached the maximum compromise possible.We won’t, just to solve Britain’s domestic political issues, stop defending European interests, he said. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this morning told MEPs he will respond favourably - but onlyBritish red lines change.  Mr Barnier said he profoundly regrets that the deal he agreed lost by the biggest Commons majority in history. But he complained the failure was based on the red lines of the British Government. Addressing the European Parliament this morning, he said: If the United Kingdom chooses to let its red lines change in future, and that it takes this choice for its advantage of the ambition of going beyond a simple but not negligible free trade accord, then the European Union would be ready immediately to ... respondfavourably. Yet the EU has repeatedly said it wont reopen the actual -page deal or the backstop contained within it for fresh talks. The backstop is a key clause which would trap the UK under EU customs rules from theres no agreement to keep the Irish border open.  Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker said there was no way the backstop would survive a vote in the UK Parliament. Mr Barnier said the ball was firmly in the UKs court. It is up to the British authorities today or tomorrow to assess the outcome of this vote and up to the British Government to indicate how we are going to take things forward on March  to an orderly withdrawal, he said.   Theresa May has promised to speak to senior parliamentarians and make a statement on next steps by Monday night. In the meantime she is expected to survive a no confidence vote in the government at the hands of Jeremy Corbyn thanks to her DUP allies. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said time was running out.   I urge the United Kingdom to clary its intentions as soon as possible, he said last night. Time isalmostup. Yet Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom today insisted she still didnt want to extend the March  date of Brexit. What we need to do is to find a way thatdeal or some part of it or an alternative deal that is negotiable can then be put to the European Union so that we will get this Brexit through by March , she told the BBC.

The humiliated PM lost the vote on her EU plan by a staggering  majority that leaves Britain staring at a catastrophic no deal. After the crushing defeat – which followed two and a half years of botched negotiations with Brussels – Mr Corbyn launched a motion of no confidence in her shygovernment. It will be voted on at pm on Wednesday. But the stubborn PM refused to quit, despite the blow to her Brexit plans that left her stripped of all authority as MPs finally buried her deal.   Instead, she plans to resurrect it and try yet again to win over MPs before the next vote on Monday. Mr Corbyn branded Mrs May’s defeat “catastrophic” and said it represented an “absolutely shydecisive” verdict on her handling of Brexit. He added: “She is only attempting to reach out now to try to keep her failed process and deal alive after it’s been so roundly rejected by Parliament on behalf of the people of this country. “At every turn the Prime Minister has closed the door on dialogue. In the last two years she’s only had one priority…the Conservative Party. Her governing principle of delay and denial has reached the end of the line.”   Mr Corbyn’s no shyconfidence motion could force an early general electionit wins the support of more than % of MPs. But his hopes of winning were undermined when the DUP’s Sammy Wilson said the party’s  MPs will back Mrs May in her fight for survival. MPs voted  to  against her Brexit plans, which critics warned would leave us tied to the EU without any say on it. The huge Tory rebellion of  Tory MPs included fervent Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg as well as leading Remainers Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve. Her two former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab also voted against the deal. The -vote margin of defeat was the worst suffered by any government and in normal circumstances would be enough to force a PM from office.  But Mrs May made clear she plans to cling on, holding talks with MPs to find “genuinely negotiable” solutions she can take back to Brussels. She pledged to open cross-party talks with senior Labour MPs over the next few days to help save Brexit. But the invitation did not initially seem to extend to Mr Corbyn. And the PM appeared to rule out any dramatic changes to her deal with aides insisting it would form the basis of her Plan B. But she was last night looking increasingly boxed in with her Cabinet, her party and Parliament all urging her to change tack. Mrs May said: “The House has spoken and this government will listen. It is clear this House does not support this deal, but tonight’s vote tells us nothing about what it does support.” As noisy crowds gathered outside Westminster she promised to approach talks Tory backbenchers, the DUP and Labour MPs “in a constructive spirit” but Downing Street immediately set out her red lines for talks. No  sources appeared to rule out discussing a customs union, a key Labour demand thought likely to command a majority, saying the PM wanted an independent trade deal. They also played down expectations of her compromising over a second shyreferendum or extending article . Mrs May insisted she was not running down the clock to no deal. She added: “Every day that passes without this issue being resolved means more uncertainty, more bitterness and more rancour.”  But Labour MP Yvette Cooper said: “This was the biggest government defeat in over  years. “The PM says she now will listen and work cross-party but she had  months to do that and she repeatedly refused. “She cannot just carry on asnothing has changed.” Hilary Benn, Labour chair of the Brexit committee, added: “The PM says she is now going to reach out across the House of Commons, she could have done that two and a half years ago”.  But Attorney General Geoffrey Cox confirmed minimal changes were expected. He said: “This agreement will have to , in much the same form, with much the same content.” Remainer Tory minister Amber Rudd, backed by several Cabinet colleagues, led calls for the PM to reach out to Labour MPs to try to reach a compromise. Senior Labour figures indicated to the Mirror they could be open to shynegotiation. It emerged PM’s chief Brexit advisor, Olly Robbins, has been working on secret contingency plans for cross-party talks. Mrs May was urged her toto shyBrussels to demand more concessions EU chiefs warned the PM to “urgently” set out her plans as the clock was ticking down to Brexit. Eurocrat Jean-Claude Juncker said: “I note with regret the outcome of the vote in the Commons this evening. “I urge the UK to clary its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up.” EU Council president Donald Tusk added: “If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is ” "},{"url":null,"title":"thousands watch brexit vote unfold","story":"NewsopinionThousands watch Brexit vote unfold outside Parliament - and they agree on one thingTheres a festival atmosphere on Parliament Square, where some of the angriest people in the country have come together to agree Theresa Mays deal is rubbishShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  JAN Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video brexit-blast-its-commons-vote-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs Theresa May hurtles unstoppably towards a humiliating defeat on her deal, she has had at least one success. Despite all the talk of a nation ided, furiously riven over what to do about our membership of the EU - she’s actually managed to unite Britain’s most ardent Leavers and Remainers on one thing. They all hate her deal. I’m referring, of course, to the people gathering outside the Houses of Parliament to protest about Brexit - one way or another. In what is rapidly becoming the political equivalent of Henman Hill, hundreds of Remainers are gathering in the cold on Parliament Square across the road, to watch the result of the meaningful vote come in. It’s like a rubbish Eurovision.  Meanwhile, a bit further down the road, more EU flags are waving, but they’re peppered with the odd pro-Brexit banner. I spoke to Leavers and Remainers, backers of a People’s Vote and folk who fancy a hard Brexit on WTO terms. And I couldn’t find a single person who was there to back Theresa May’s deal. Kate, who works in the NHS, and Pete, a retired journalist, have been standing on the corner all day with a sign that says “Hoot for Brexit”. Kate says they they’ve had “hundreds” of cars passing them and honking their horn since they’ve been standing there - including what looked awfully like a ministerial car, which passed while we were chatting. Pete doesn’t like May’s deal because it doesn’t take us out of the single market or EU rules. “I’d be happy with no deal, so we can make our own deals as we go along,” he said. He reckons the problem was that the EU have been playing hardball, and Mrs May hasn’t.   Meanwhile, across the square, Charlie Rone, a -year-old from Charlton is dressed up as Jacob Rees-Mogg, complete with top hat and tails. He’s a regular protester outside Parliament, and alternates between the Mogg costume and a Robocop outfit. He changes daily because press photographers have confided that they wouldn’t snap himhe was in the same costume every day, because they still have the previous day’s photos for sale. And he’s not a fan of the PM’s deal either. He said: “I hope that the deal gets thrown out, because it’s a very, very bad deal because it cedes all our control away to the EU and it puts us into their hands.” As we were talking, a gentleman in a van slowed down at the pedestrian crossing to advise Charlie to take his top hat and “stick it where the sun don’t shine.”   There’s also a fellow walking around the area dressed as a plague doctor, complete with a black hook-nose mask, shouting “THE BELL TOLLS FOR THE DEATH OF BREXIT.” He declined to be interviewed, but gives off the distinct impression he wasn’t a fan of the PM’s withdrawal agreement. The atmosphere in Westminster tonight is noisy, but relatively amicable. People are arguing about Brexit in the street - but they’re doing it quite politely. There’s little evidence of the sinister, borderline fascistic displays of intimidation that has been much discussed in recent weeks, but it hasn’t entirely gone away.   Tucked away in a corner, next to a small band of pro-Brexiteers hammering drums and ringing a bell, I spotted a placard bearing the slogan “CUCK YOUR VOTE”, and telling “CONSPIRATORS” they were “CHEATING BRITAIN FOR BROWNSHIRT POINTS”. Alongside a picture of Theresa May, there’s a small tree with a noose in its branches. But largely it’s a festival atmosphere, where some of the angriest people in the country have come together to agree that the Prime Minister is rubbish.

Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said Alfie died from crush asphyxia in February last year. He said: “It was caused by the passenger seat, Waterson’s seat, being moved further into the rear passenger-side footwell.  “In effect, he was squashed by the car seat and suffocated. “This was a deliberate action by Waterson who knew Alfie was there and was angered by the noise and fuss [he made].”  Medics and police were called in Croydon, South London, and Waterson and Hoare allegedly lied about what happened. Mr Atkinson said it was obvious Alfie had been dead for some time and CCTV showed all of them travelling in an Audi.   Hoare allegedly told medics: “We got in a taxi. He fell asleep. We tried to wake him and found him unresponsive.” She said the driver “kicked us out” and left. Mr Atkinson said it was “only the beginning of the lies”. Hoare and Waterson have also since attacked Miss Williams and Mr Lamb respectively, he added.  Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault. Waterson denies manslaughter and intimidating Mr Lamb. The couple, of Croydon, and Williams admit conspiring to pervert justice. The Old Bailey trial continues.

It doesn’t necessarily suggest that they are under a structural element of the vehicle. They are under the vehicle but it’s basically impossible to tell from the video whether they were under a structural element of the car.   “The image on the camera is of the jacked up [Ford Escort] and [Mr King] going around the side of it, the far side away from the camera. “The next time the CCTV is triggered, the car has fallen off the stands and is laying on the ground.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how meghan markle transformed party","story":"NewsHow Meghan Markle transformed party-loving Prince Harry with daddy detoxThe Duke of Sussex reportedly revealed he now practises meditation every day - a hobby that appears to have been inspired by we Meghan MarkleShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsMeghan revealed she is six months pregnant on a day out with Harry this week \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOnce a party-lover, Prince Harry appears to have transformed somewhat since meeting Meghan Markle - even revealing this week that he practises meditation.

Harry, , has also reportedly become a yoga fan after being introduced by his we last year. And cigarettes are a thing of the past. According to reports, the father-to-be has started meditating every day, and people think this new pastime may have been inspired by his we. On the Duke and Duchesss first official engagement of the year on Monday, in Birkenhead, Prince Harry revealed his new hobby.   People claims Prince Harry chatted with a -year-old Buddhist monk named Kelsang Sonam in the Merseyside town, telling him about his daily meditation habit. Kelsang reportedly presented him with a copy of a book called  Steps to Happiness. Meghan, who announced shes six months pregnant on the day out, is also known to be a big fan of meditation. The former Suits actress once posted about it on her now defunct lestyle blog, The Tig. On the blog she admitted she had been daunted by the prospect of meditation at first and worried she would find it boring.  However she stuck with it and claims it made her much happier. She previously wrote: Last week marked the one year anniversary of my relationship with meditation, something I found endlessly daunting at first , but soon became the quietude that rocked my world. I cant put my finger on the why or the how, but I will tell you this much, for me...I am just happier. And meditation has so much to do with that. I urge you to give it a shot. The worst thing that can happen is that you gave yourself ten minutes of quiet in an endlessly loud world. Shhhhh......it feels good.

Stella Brown, , suffers from achalasia which affects the oesophagus and can mean the muscles cant contract properly. Swallowing can become near impossible with food and drink unable to pass through to the stomach and often being brought back up. Stella, from Leicester, said her disorder left her unable to swallow properly and in constant pain. Thankfully, after surgery her diet has been expanded, but Stella says for two years the only thing she was able to eat was Cadburys Creme Eggs. She told Leicestershire Live: To be honest, laugh or not - Cadburys Creme Eggs saved my le. They were the only food I could eat - odd I know but it is true. I had one one day and for some reason I could eat it and it just stayed down.   Speaking about how it all began, she said: It was really weird because I just woke up one day and I couldnt swallow. It got worse over the next two weeks and eventually I went to the hospital and they thought it was just a reflux and gave me some Gaviscon. Three weeks later, Stella said she was finding it almost impossible to keep water down, and was struggling to swallow anything at all. Everything started coming up, and I started to panic, she said. Theres not really any medication to ease the pain and I lost weight so much that Ive literally gone down to size  clothes. I was starting to get really depressed because of the weight that I had lost. I have had two operations to dilate my oesophagus just so I can swallow - which I struggle with every day.  At this point Stella claims doctors told her she only had a year to liveher condition did not improve. NHS guidelines say there is no cure to the disorder but certain treatments can help sufferers. These include medicine, surgery to stretch the oesophagus muscle, and botox injections into the ring of muscle to help it to relax. Stella has had two operations which have helped her. This surgery is called balloon dilation, and involves a balloon being inflated inside the oesophagus to help stretch the muscle so that people can swallow more easily. But Stella thinks herback to health is also down to the Cadburys Creme Eggs. She said: Before I started eating them I would faint a lot because I wasnt getting the energy I needed from food and would blackout. They saved my le. I carried one around with me wherever I went for two years. The symptoms, according to the NHS, are:choking and coughing fits heartburn chest pain repeated chest infections drooling of vomit or saliva gradual but signicant weight loss. Since having surgery, Stella says she can eat a bigger selection of foods, however she is still sick every day. Its dficult,I got to a restaurant, for example, I have to sit as close to the toilets as possible, just in case. And its not just her social le that has been affected. I want to go back to work, but because of my sickness it affects my ability to work, she told. I have volunteered at the council working in kitchens cooking for elderly and also on Goldhill Park a year ago, helping out in school holidays. But after my latest results in February I will see what lies ahead and try and get back into work when Im fully fit and healthy.

The young girl is strapped into the buggy as it rolls off the pavement and in front of the car approaching a queue of vehicles at a red light. As driver Bodrul Islam hits the brakes, a pedestrian runs across the road and pushes the child to safety in Longsight, Manchester. Mr Islam claims the toddlers parent had no idea the child had rolled into traffic, telling the Manchester Evening News the girl was just like a deer in headlights.   The -year-old engineer, from Burnage, was already slowing down for the red light when he spotted the child and slammed on the brakes at about .pm on Tuesday. He initially thought it was a trolley, and said the girl was unaware of the danger she faced. After the child was wheeled back onto the pavement, a woman appeared from a shop nearby and shoved off and ran, Mr Islam claims. He said she didnt say a word to him or the Good Samaritan who pushed the child out of harms way in Stockport Road. Mr Islam said of the incident: It is always rammed at that time.    I think I had already started braking for the light. There was a van, and just as I passed, I saw it and thought it was a trolley. I slammed my foot on the brake, I thought I was going to cause an accident. He added: I stopped and I was shouting and swearing as I got out my car and I realised it was a kid. I put my hazards on and a guy ran across the road and grabbed the kid. It was a little girl, she didnt know what was going on, she just like a deer in headlights. Related video: Shocking moment a child flies out of car still attached to her car seat  In the moment, I was just shocked and concerned. He claimed: It wasnt the parent, the mother who came first, it felt like ages. This woman came out the pound shop and just walked off, she didnt say anything, she just shoved off and ran. Mr Islam went home and reflected on the incident. He said: I just got angry. I just thought where the hell was the parent  It was just ridiculous. Earlier this week, shocking dashcam video emerged showing a toddler tumbling out of a moving car while still strapped to her car seat. The car continued on as the girl was in the middle of the street in the US city of Mankato, Minnesota. A man who was driving behind the car hit the brakes, jumped out and rescued the girl.

Dawlton, six, and Kayleigh, one, have been named by a distraught family friend as two of the tragic youngsters involved. They were playing with another four-year-old - who has not been named - when they all climbed inside an unplugged chest freezer left in a garden in Suwanee County, Florida. It is thought a hasp lock fell shut, meaning they could not get out and they were left fighting for their lives. They had been left alone while their babysitter went to the bathroom, police said.  When the woman could not find them she alerted another female in the house and they began a frantic search. Their worst fears were confirmed when they found the three children not breathing inside the freezer. A police official said: Unfortunately, all efforts to resuscitate the children were unsuccessful and all three children died. A GoFundMe page has been set up by Scott Whisnant for the siblings who had a tragic ending to their lives too soon.   It reads: I babysat these two children I bonded with them. Their family is like my family and Im wanting to help ease the burden. These funds are going to be used to help with final expenses and whatever bills there is. I would like to be able to hand this family the funds within two weeks. Lets help this grieving family but more importantly lets help show kindness to Kayleigh and Dawlton. A police official confirmed earlier this week that initial investigations revealed for unknown reasons they climbed inside of a chest freezer that had recently been brought to the residence, but was not yet plugged in or brought inside, when the adult female went inside of the residence to use the restroom.   They added: When the female ed to the yard, she could not locate the children so she woke up the other adult female who was at home, sleeping, preparing to work the night sht, and they began to search the property and an adjacent vacant home for the children. When they opened the chest freezer, they discovered all three children inside of it, not breathing, and began resuscitative efforts and called . Upon further inspection of the freezer, an after-market, hasp had been installed on the lid in order to secure a padlock on it.  It is believed at this time, that when the children entered the freezer, and the lid closed, the hasp fell shut, trapping the children inside. There was no padlock on the freezer. The Florida Department of Children and Families has also been notied. The investigation is still ongoing, but at this time, foul play is not suspected.

The naturally occurring ice circle, believed to be  yards wide, has been attracting onlookers from far and wide to the Presumpscot River in Westbrook, Maine, USA.Doug Bertlesman, who works in a building overlooking the water, said the bizarre formation is wild. He told the Press Herald: It kind of looks like a crop circle. It’s pretty wild to look at.  “It’s certainly not every day that you can watch a spinning circle of ice in the river. Rob Mitchell, who owns a nearby office building, was one of the first to spot the circle on Monday. He said: There were ducks sitting on it. The ducks were rotating on this big Lazy Susan. It was a big duck-go-round. It’s stuck right there. It’s not going anywhere.

Jake Thomas Patterson is also accused of murdering the -year-olds parents with a shotgun before hiding the teen in his house for months. Now a former partner, named only as Briana, has spoken out to reveal more details about the scumbag she date for four months. Speaking to Radar Online, she claimed the suspect had revealed the obsession to her after a dead dog was found in local woods. She said: “That’s when he told me he was ‘experimenting’ with animals.I was like, ‘What the f*** ’ ”   Briana, who dated Patterson, of Gordon, Wisconsin, for four months in high school, also claimed he had a fetish with roadkill. She added: “It was an insane obsession of his. “His cabin was full of animal heads, but I don’t think people understand that he found those animals on the side of the road and stuffed them himself.” Recalling an argument that the pair had, she said she was terried when Patterson appeared in a mask. “I saw his true colors that night, he was so full of rage,’’ she said.   “He literally scared the hell out of me. I was at the cabin, and he came out with this weird-looking masquerade mask. It was scary as hell.” She also claimed that the alleged killer slashed the tyres of her mums car after the pair broke up. Prosecutors claim Patterson killed Jaymes parents - James and Denise - and abducted the schoolgirl at the familys house on his third attempt. He had abandoned two previous attempts because cars were parked outside the house in Barron, Wisconsin, and lights were on. Patterson told police he targeted Jayme at random after seeing her board a school bus near her home, and he didnt know the names of his victims until afterwards as he followed media coverage of the case, according to a criminal complaint.   Jayme was held under the bed for up to  hours at a time without food, water or bathroom breaks, it is claimed. She escaped last week when Patterson told her he would be out for about five to six hours. The teen pushed the bins and weights away from the bed, crawled out and ran out of the home wearing a pair of Pattersons shoes, the complaint said.  Patterson has been charged with two counts of intentional homicide and one count each of kidnapping and armed burglary. He appeared briefly in court via videolink on Monday and was remanded in custody on millionbail. He has not entered pleas to the charges.

Rahaf - who has renounced her last name, al-Qunun - alleged she suffered horric abuse at her familys hands, which they deny. She arrived in Canada on Saturday after the country granted her asylum - and she was pictured at Toronto International Airport wearing a hoodie with the word Canada on it.

Virginia Tapscott, , said she stopped using the products last year after becoming concerned about the amount of toxic chemicals she claims to be in mainstream beauty products. The mum-of-two, from New South Wales, Australia, has also quit using, perfume, conditioners, face cleansers, body washes and moisturisers. Thrty Virginia has even ditched her makeup, fake-tan and hair dye. In the process of cutting down on the toiletries and beauty goods, the freelance writer says she has saved almost ,AUD - around pound,. Virginia cut down using soap and completely stopped washing her three-year-old son Oscars hair - while her daughter Elke, one, has never been exposed to any products other than water and oil.   She said: When I was pregnant with my daughter, I started to really think about what toxic chemicals are in all the beauty and household products that I was using every day. The chemicals are not just terrible for our health, but they have a huge impact on our overall environment footprint. I also wanted to stop the amount of waste and plastic that was going straight to landfill. So it all made sense to me. I decided to cut out washing my hair with shampoo and conditioner, while also stop using soap on my body in the shower. I didnt know what would happen but wanted to give it a go. Now I just use warm water and a washcloth, and it makes for a really quick shower. Our skin produces all these natural oils that keep it clean and healthy anyway. Water is a powerful solvent in itself so that is going to get off any dirt or grime, especially when you use a washcloth.   As for my hair, its never felt better. It does feel dferent and its obviously not like it was when I was washing it, but it doesnt smell. Its far less knotty than it was. The natural oils make it easier to brush. I will scrub it with bicarb sodait feels oily, but that is very rare. I also sometimes just rub tapioca flour in my hair and brush it out, which is like a natural dry shampoo. My skin has also never looked better. It used to be on the dry side but now it feels amazing. Now the only products Virginia uses on her skin is pure jojoba oil and a mineral sunscreen, which only costs her pound [AUD] per year. The mum still uses a bar of hand soap for hygiene, but has ditched commercial deodorant and toothpaste altogether - saving her around  [pound] in the last  months. She now makes her own toothpaste from bentonite clay and calcium carbonate - while her homemade deodorant is simply coconut oil, bicarb soda and essential oils. Virginia said she used to be addicted to bleaching her hair and applying fake tan to achieve that year-round glow - and added those were the hardest things to give up.   But after ditching home hair dye, monthly salon appointments and giving up the fake tan, it has saved her a whopping , [pound,] a year. Virginia said: Hair dye and fake tan were the most dficult things to give up. I loved getting my hair coloured. But in the end I couldnt do it anymore. I couldnt justy all the bleach going down the drain and polluting the waterways, and it was also is was irritating my skin. I know its nice to do nice things for yourself as a woman, but there is freedom in not dying your hair for a year and realising that this is actually what my hair looks like. I dont feel like Im missing out on anything. I feel better than I ever have. A minimal approach can save you thousands of dollars. Its not ridiculous and it doesnt mean that you have less personal hygiene, its just cutting out less. Its a huge misconception that we smell bad, because we honestly dont at all. Virginia - who is married to electrician husband Paul,  - said her children have only benefited from the minimisation of mainstream beauty products. Virginia hopes that her daughter Elke will grow up without feeling the usual pressures placed on females to conform to a certain standard of beauty.   She added that by being a role model for her daughter, it may help curb issues like low self-esteem and poor body image. Virginia said: My daughter has never been exposed to soap or shampoo. She has had nothing on her skin except oil since she was born it has made a world of dference. I give her a good wash in the tub and sometimes Ill put some oil in there. My son doesnt get rashes anymore, and people tell me all the time how beautul his curls are I think by doing this it will also help my daughter develop good self-esteem and a positive body image. What is even better than saving money is that weve stopped so many chemicals from going into both our bodies and the environment. It was the best decision Ive ever made.

Disturbing images, taken in Bishnupur, show the panicked animals fleeing as residents hurled flaming sticks and chased them with batons to deter them from damaging properties. Reports claim that deforestation has forced the confused animals into areas inhabited by humans. Other heartbreaking photos show a group of elephants attempting to navigate a railway line which runs straight through their habitat. In another image, the herd are pelted with rocks. The shocking pictures have angered animal rights activists around the world. They have called for more to be done to protect elephants from encroaching deforrestation.  Photographer Biplab Hazra, who captured the attack, has demanded an end to the destruction of the elephant habitats in the area. He told Caters: “This happens because the villagers have to save their crops. “There are many elephant corridors in human habitations. I’m trying to show this and spread my photos to increase public awareness on the matter.”Last year, footage emerged of a man being trampled to death by a wild elephant in Sri Lanka as his distraught family watched on.The man jumped out of his car in Kataragama, near Yala National Park, in a bid to stop the elephant and hypnotise it. But his trick spectacularly failed when the huge animal turned and ran towards him, knocking him to the ground as he tried to get away.The elephant then lts one of its rights leg and tramples him, crushing him to death immediately.

After last season, everyone expected a struggle but when they came in expectations changed to possibly a top-seven finish.“Up until October that was probably on the cards but they’ve dropped like a stone since, though that’s not to do with Davies. When he’s played he’s been excellent.”Quickly after signing for his boyhood club Pools in the summer, Davies was made club captain – a role he performed with distinction at Ross County, too – but Kennedy says Hartlepool’s loss will be Dundee’s gain.“He’s played for some good clubs and Dundee fans can look forward to him putting his head or whatever in where it hurts,” he added.“He’s somebody who plays for the badge and is a real battler, aggressive and whole-hearted.“Getting  games from him might be the dference between staying up and going down for Dundee.“Going away to a tough place like Aberdeen or Hearts or Hibs and you need somebody to head away every ball and give everything to win, he’s your man.“That’s something Hartlepool never had last season and I’m disappointed they’ve lost him for his leadership.“He’s a real leader and they’ll miss his presence around the place.“He was brilliant at times in the National League. It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":null,"title":"andy dales to join dundee but another signing needed after andrew davies blow","story":"Jim McIntyre was boosting his Dundee squad with the arrival of English winger Andy Dales yesterday but is set to resume his search for a centre-half after injury fears over another new signing Andrew Davies was confirmed.Twenty-four-year-old Dales was due at Dens for training yesterday morning after the Dark Blues agreed a deal with Scunthorpe.The former Derby kid can play on either flank and also in a central role.After  years in the youth ranks at the Rams, Dales stepped down to non-league football before moving to Scunthorpe last summer.

The sole motivation of the owners is to offset the losses of the club against any gains made by Dark Blue Property Holdings.#The club met with the appropriate solicitors to discuss this matter over the following months in order to move the process forward.#In July  the Supporters Society enquired whether within this process they could move their class rights associated with the ‘A’ shares into a shareholding agreement.#The owners of the club took into consideration this request, as taking on the Society shares would save time and money needed for the share issue process, and therefore began negotiations in good faith to purchase the ‘A’ shares from the Society.#The acquisition of the ‘A’ shares has potential benefits for both sides, and while the negotiation of the finer details has yet to transpire, one such benefit is that the club could operate in a more commercial manner, which would allow for idends to be paid.

That’s a worry.Seven goals in his first  games after arriving from Danes Aalborg in August suggested the man to get the goals to fire them to promotion had been found.The last seven games, with just one strike to his credit, have dampened such expectations.And while that work he puts in when up front, often on his own, means he continues to be a vital cog in the wheel for the team, there is little question he’d benefit from a regular strike partner.Of course, the arrival of Nesbitt and Smith should help ease the burden on whoever is right up front but only to a degree.Both are capable of chipping in with goals but a good chunk of the work they do is likely to be in creating chances as opposed to taking them.Putting more goals in the team would also ease the pressure on the defence.While the back four have been leaking too many goals this season, they’ve too often taken to the pitch knowing the loss of just one goal may well see a point or points dropped.That’s why the next couple of weeks will see Neilson, presumably backed by new owner Mark Ogren’s money, pull out all the stops to find another quality striker.Particularly in this transfer window, that’s usually easier said than done.If he succeeds and United are back in the top flight come the end of the season it would have been well worth the effort."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian

this curious looking head-gear be the worldrsquos earliest surviving example of a Glengarry-style bonnet once worn by Highlander clansmen after the act of Proscription banned Highland dress That is the belief of relentless researcher Robert Harbord who is spurring-on staff at Inverness Museum to help solve the mystery.Being Oxford-based and an avid Highland visitor, Mr Harbord is perplexed by the bonnet which nestles inconspicuously behind glass in a cabinet in the museum building.And his task in hand is no mean feat: He wants to track down the inidual who unearthed it more than  years ago ndash or at least speak to one of their surviving relatives.Because he believes the bonnet is unique.He said: ldquoDespite their very best efforts, and their best record-keeping going back to , Inverness Museum does not have any other information on this particular item other than it was found in a peat bog in Fort Augustus pre-s.\"Its origins are a complete mystery.ldquoMy hope is that an article in the Courier might stimulate someone who does know more about its origins to come forward.Research shows bonnets in the lead up to the Battle of Culloden were knitted affairs, large, wide and flat.Insight into the crucial role they once played has been handed down by many historical sources but none so colourfully than the thcentury government roads contractor Edmund Burt who was sent to Inverness from London in the s.Remarking upon the Highlanderrsquos hardened stance to the wet weather in his letters to a friend, Burt, in his book Letters from the North of Scotland said their bonnets were ldquofrequently taken off and wrung like a dish-clout, and then put back on again.Mr Harbord said his research suggests that following the Act of Proscription in  banning Highland dress, clansmen pushed the sides of their bonnets upwards \"and at a stroke created an entirely new shape of bonnet\".And he strongly suspects that the Glengarry-style bonnet in Inverness Museum could be the earliest surviving example.He added: ldquoWhile the word bonnet was not actually mentioned in the Act, it can well be imagined that a clansman from Glen Garry, travelling to the strategically sited Fort Augustus six miles away, might think thathe was spotted by an Army patrol wearing a Highlanderrsquos traditional flat blue bonnet, he could very well be arrested, and jailed for six months, on the spot.Museum curator xxx apologies her name is in the caption of the pictures xxx said no information exists to argue otherwise.She said: ldquoWe think that it came to us before . Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible. If it does turn out to be the oldest one then that would make it a very signicant object. We would be delightedthat could be confirmed in some way.Wednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119131.jpg","title":"Inverness cafe closure purely a commercial decision","story":"A CAFE occupying one of the most prominent sites in the city for the past five years is to close, but the owner has refused to blame steep rates for the decision to sell.The -plus staff of So Coco at  High Street were given redundancy notices last weekend, and it is likely the popular restaurant, famed for its Spanish-style chocolate and churros, will close on January .However the owner, the Caledonian Coffee Co Ltd, is actively seeking a new business partner and other premises, and So Coco could rise again after a period of ldquohibernation.Director Roy Dinnes said he was sad to see the business close, especially for the staff who were ldquoa credit to the business, and he was amazed at the social media reaction that saw more than  dismayed customers post comments within  hours.It was purely a commercial decision said the Forres hotelier, and a deal with the new owner of the premises is at an advanced stage.

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13859701.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171103908.jpg","title":"ayr united fans chance sleep","story":"NewsAyr United fans have chance to sleep on Somerset Park in homeless fundraiserThe fundraiser, being staged by Ayr United and homeless charity SeAscape, will be held under the lights at Somerset Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAyr stars Robbie Crawford, Andy Murdoch, Craig Moore and Declan McDaid join Ky Kane of SeAscape \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United fans dream of playing on Somerset Park’s hallowed turf.

The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"sleazy pensioner took pictures schoolgirls","story":"NewsSleazy pensioner took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirtsA court ruled there was ‘a substantial sexual element to his breach of the peace offence, writes Edwin Lawrence.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  JAN NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sleazy retired architect took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirts.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

her office then repeatedly refused to name who was involved.Mr Hamiltonrsquos presence was revealed by Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, who said Ms Lloyd told him before the meeting, in late March, that she suspected that a misconduct complaint had been levelled against Mr Salmond, but she did not know any specics, and had not told Ms Sturgeon.When the conversation was relayed to Mr Salmond it was interpreted as an attempt by Ms Lloyd to put him off trying toto frontline politics, adding to his tensions with Ms Sturgeon.Ms Aberdein said he was also at Ms Sturgeonrsquos home on April , but that Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond talked alone.Mr Carlaw said it stretched credulity that Ms Lloyd had discussed a complaint against Mr Salmond with Mr Aberdein, then arranged a meeting between Mr Salmond and the First Minister without telling her what was coming.He said: ldquoIf itrsquos true, the chief of staff was failing in her duty, anditrsquos not true, the First Minister was even more reckless in proceeding with the discussion.Ms Sturgeonrsquos spokesman declined to elaborate on Mr Aberdeinrsquos statement or Ms Lloydrsquos role, maintained April  was a ldquoparty meeting, and said Ms Sturgeon continued to have full confidence in Ms Lloyd and Ms Evans.A spokesperson for Mr Salmond said: ldquoAlex will be happy to co-operate, in principle andasked, with a parliamentary inquiry which seeks to examine how the administration of the Scottish government could get itself into a position where the Court of Session had to rule that it had acted unlawfully, unfairly and tainted by apparent bias.Welcoming the Holyrood inquiry, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: ldquoThis is the right decision and a positive step forward. Full transparency in this matter is essential in order for the public to have confidence in the First Minister and the Scottish government."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-the-snp-needs-to-face-up-to-the-political-reality-of-disunity","story":"The Salmond affair has collided with a dispute in the party about the future of independence. Mr Salmond has made no secret of his enthusiasm for an early referendum, and made clear last spring that he intended toto active politics to help lead it. Not everyone in the Scottish Government was entirely relaxed about this prospect.The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has been intensely cautious about any future referendum, not least because of her failed attempt to launch one in . But many activists are instinctively with Mr Salmond, and believe a historic opportunity could be lost. The issue has been rumbling in the undergrowth since October when Ms Sturgeon once again delayed her long-promised timetable for indyref. She said shersquod deliver it when the fog of Brexit had cleared ndash but many in the party, even her strongest supporters, are giving up hope that there will be a referendum before the current mandate expires in .:Nicola Sturgeon facing second inquiry over Alex Salmond as feud worsensLast week, the First Minister yet again promised a statement on the referendum timetable, but that was overtaken by the Scottish Governmentrsquos defeat in court, when it admitted it had acted unlawfully and unfairly over the Salmond inquiry. Now, the prospects of any announcement this year must be close to zero.Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to parliamentrsquos standards , which could take three months to report. Parliament also agreed a special committee to investigate her series of private meetings with Mr Salmond. The  will probably exonerate her from any serious violation of the ministerial code. Therersquos nothing in the rules that says the First Minister canrsquot speak to her predecessor, though it is likely to say there should have been a written record of any meeting in which her chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, was present.But this will not be the end of the matter. There is also a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner into the leaks of the Salmond ldquosex pest allegations to the Daily Record, which could be highly damaging. The journalists will of course protect their sources. Ms Sturgeon, on behalf of the Scottish Government, will deny all knowledge of a leak. But there will be a wealth of speculation and a running commentary from both sides.Already, wersquove had Ms Sturgeonrsquos spokespeople accusing ldquoTeam Salmond of ldquosmearing her. This is the first time I can recall such a serious accusation being made between such senior SNP figures in public. Mr Salmond claims that Ms Lloyd made contact with him in March, before he was informed of the allegations against him, and advised him not toto active politics. Ms Sturgeon denies that her chief of staff had prior knowledge of the specic complaints, though she concedes that Mr Salmondrsquos future had been discussed ldquoin the context of #metoo ndash which rather suggests that he was being warned off.Read More: Sturgeon accuses Team SalmondThis takes us into another ongoing aspect of this case: the presumption of innocence. The First Ministerrsquos many supporters on social media have been condemning Mr Salmond for making le more dficult for the ldquocourageous women, as the Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described the civil service employees who made the complaints. This public speculation about Mr Salmondrsquos presumed guilt actually does no service to those women. As the former President of the Scottish Law Society, Ian Smart ndash a long-term critic of Mr Salmond ndash pointed out this week, such prejudicial commentary could undermine prospects for a successful prosecution. ldquoIfthis matter should ever proceed criminally, he wrote, ldquothese are remarks upon which any competent defence team will undoubtedly seize.The police have been examining Mr Salmondrsquos conduct over recent years and questioning employees and colleagues of the former First Minister to establish whether there is any evidence of similar sexual harassment. This is standard practice in such cases. But it is dficult for details of an investigation into such a high-profile figure as Mr Salmond not to leak into the public domain.No one knows whether Mr Salmond will be found to be innocent, I certainly have no wish to speculate on this. But many of his supporters believe that the most likely outcome is that the police will find insufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution. This could be the worst of both worlds for the SNP, because some would declare Mr Salmond guilty by default, others would condemn the Scottish Government for investigating him in the first place, and for making the allegations public.Whatever happens, Mr Salmond has made clear he will claim damages from the Scottish Government, which will rack up the already-substantial legal bill being paid by the taxpayer. That will renew the attack on Ms Sturgeonrsquos handling of the affair. Opposition parties may eventually support the call from the former SNP minister, Alex Neill, this week for a full judge-led inquiry into the procedures and practices of the Scottish Government that led to last weekrsquos Court of Session fiasco.So, this story could run and run ndash but will it destroy the SNP Government  I doubt it. In the end, Ms Sturgeon is not directly implicated in the mishandling of the Salmond inquisition ndash that was her civil servants. Moreover, Brexit and the aftermath to last nightrsquos vote will dominate politics for the next year. Scottish voters are quite capable of looking beyond questions about Mr Salmondrsquos personal conduct to the bigger issues.However, a bit of ision right now might be no bad thing. The SNP is far too averse to controversy, and it is about time it had a proper debate about its future and its leadership structures. Making a fetish of unity, and ignoring political reality, is almost as dangerous as a split."},{"url":null,"title":"how-did-european-media-react-to-crucial-brexit-vote","story":"In France Le Monde says Mrs May was subject to a \"humiliating defeat\" that left the future of her Government and Brexit \"more uncertain than ever\".The Prime Ministers loss is on the front page of El Pais in Spain, which says the \"crushing defeat\" make the \"crisis\" over Brexit worse.: Brexit crisis just got much deeper ndash who,anyone, will take control In Germany Der Spiegel says Mrs Mays Brexit plan has been \"shattered\" and asks: \"Must she go now \" - while a commentator for Bild describes the situation as \"Brexshit\".In Belgium LEchos headline reads \"The shadow of a hard Brexit\", while La Libre Belgique mulls \"the jump into the void of the British parliament\".The Brexit vote is also on the front of two papers in Sweden, the Svenska Dagbladet, which leads with Mrs Mays \"historic loss\", and the Dagens Nyheter, which says: \"After the historic setback - Mays fate can be decided today.\"In Denmark the national Jyllands-Posten leads with the \"big defeat for May\", saying it leaves Brexit facing \"maximum insecurity\".:Theresa Mays Brexit deal suffers historic Commons defeatDescribing the loss as a \"humiliating defeat\" that has \"thrust Britain further into political chaos\", the New York Times picks up on Mrs Mays warning before the vote that the decision will \"set the future of our country for generations\".The paper says: \"Like most others, though, the prime minister had no easy answers about the way forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-to-scrap-free-sunday-city-centre-street-parking","story":"The move comes after the council says free parking was having a damaging effect and a lack of availability as drivers park for free for longer.The council is proposing charging on a Sunday the same as Monday to Saturday with a pound per  minutes or pound an hour with a maximum stay of two hours, meaning there will be parking charges seven days a week in the city centre.Currently, there are no charges on SundayPoor air quality and increase pollution are thought to be one of the reasons free parking is considered being removed with drivers looking around for a space thought to be a contributor to congestion and air quality.Good vehicles and deliveries being able to unload are also being affected by free parking on Sunday according to the council.The Councils plan is to introduce restrictions to encourage drivers to move on and ensure there is a sufficient supply of short term parking spaces in the city centre for shoppers, tourists and businesses.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council told The Evening Times: ldquoThe current situation leads to a number of problems such as congestion, frustration for motorists struggling to find somewhere to park, dficulties with loading and unloading vehicles, all underlined by unacceptable levels of pollution.ldquoThe proposals are about ensuring the best and most even use of the limited space for street parking in the city centre.ldquoBut they are also about encouraging better use of under-utilised car parks and encouraging a sht to more sustainable forms of transport.ldquoThe recent Connectivity Commission report highlighted the need for radical change in the cityrsquos transport system.

Cllr Anne Stirling, Chair of the Communities Committee, explained: “Since the publication of our ten-year strategies for Culture and Sport in April , we have been working hard on a new model of delivery which will allow elected members and staff to best ensure the needs and demands of Aberdeenshire residents are met and our strategic aims achieved.“A considerable amount of work is ongoing by staff across several council services to make this possible and residents will reap the benefits in the improved quality of service that will be achieved.” As part of the new way of working, a sub committee of the Communities Committee has been created to drive the new delivery model and help investigate ways to remove barriers to participation.David Cook, recently retired Assistant Principal of Banff and Buchan College, is one of the externally recruited industry experts volunteering their time to drive forward Live Le Aberdeenshire.David, who has held distinguished roles in the charity and business sectors, for which he won the UK Manager of the Year title in , Chairs the Sub Committee. He commented: “I have always been passionate about the contribution that sport and culture can make not only to quality of le but also to people’s fundamental health and wellbeing.“I am pleased my experience, which includes marketing and funding, will be put to good use and I look forward to helping lead the development of Live Le Aberdeenshire and the benefit this will bring to local communities.”Cllr Anne Stirling added: “Aberdeenshire Council has stated in its Key Priorities that it will encourage active lestyles and promote wellbeing with a focus on obesity and mental health. We have also recognised the valuable contribution sport and culture make to raising levels of attainment and achievement in our children and young people. We look forward very much to working with our industry experts and benefitting from the many skills they have generously agreed to share with Council Members and staff.” John Harding, Head of Service for the newly created Live Le Aberdeenshire, is committed to empowering local staff to deliver services which best meet the needs of their local communities. He said: “We have had a long, hard look at the ways we work together across services and how we can act jointly to ensure we can improve the experiences of service users. This is an ongoing and sometimes challenging process but one that is very rewarding and productive.” data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The event has been organised by make up artists Julia Stronach and Alana McCrae\"  Beauticians to host ‘Make Off’ viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Live Le Aberdeenshire was launched with the signing of a Statement of Ambition which articulates how council services will strive together to make this new, more flexible service work.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Wednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

The following autumn links were formed with Moray Firth Radio and a restricted service licence was applied for to enable a temporary broadcast in the area.In October , the first broadcast took place. The station was based in a portable building in the garden of a local councillors house. Caithness community radio took to the airwaves for the first time.

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles. I also want to make sure that Michael Ross’s family get the right to reply.”If you have information which could be valuable to Mr Clarkson, you can contact him on  , or by emailing wensleyclarkson@yahoocopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument.

It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride.

I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress.

He said: “In the college sector there is no prospect of them finding additional resources for any cost-of-living increases for their staff.”However, Mr Swinney defended the funding for further education in the proposed budget.He said: “Resources clearly are there because the employers have offered that.“The colleges sector finds itself in a position able to harmonise the contracts of further education lecturers across the country, which I’m very pleased the Government has been able to secure as a policy objective and which is now being implemented over a three-year period from funding by the Scottish Government.“In addition to that, college employers are able to make cost-of-living increases available to members of staff into the bargaining.“I don’t think it’s defensible to separate harmonisation and cost-of-living as two separate things.”Members of two teaching unions voted by  per cent to  per cent in favour of the strike action in December – on a turnout of  per cent – after rejecting the pay offer Colleges Scotland claims would have raised average salaries from £, to £, over the past three years.Picket lines have been formed outside colleges throughout Scotland. Dozens of lecturers gathered outside the Scottish Parliament to protest.Urging Colleges Scotland to “ to meaningful negotiations in the hope of agreeing a resolution to this dispute”, EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: “Lecturers have been forced into this strike action by an intransigent management group that has refused to even attempt to reach a negotiated solution ahead of today’s strike.“Scotland’s college lecturers have not received a cost-of-living pay increase since  and are asking for only the same type of cost-of-living increase that has been awarded to many other groups of public sector workers.“Our revised claim, submitted in December, is wholly consistent with Scottish Government public sector pay policy.“Yet Colleges Scotland has not yet responded to this revised claim and is continuing to use the delivery of equal pay as a barrier to negotiation, using conflated figures in publicity to obfuscate the pay claim.”Colleges Scotland chief executive Shona Struthers said: “It is extremely disappointing that the EIS-FELA is taking disruptive strike action for the third time in four years, especially when the colleges’ pay offer, combined with salary rises from the ‘same pay’ settlement, would see lecturers’ national average pay increase over three years by . per cent, which is a cash increase of over £,.“This offer on the table is the best overall pay rise for public-sector workers anywhere in the UK, but the EIS-FELA want even more.“They also want more pay for cost of living, but a pay rise is a pay rise, irrespective of whether it comes from the ‘same pay’ agreement or the additional cost-of-living offer.“Finances are extremely tight for colleges and all of the modest £. million revenue increase in the Scottish Government’s   draft budget is ring-fenced to pay for the ‘same pay’ rises already agreed so colleges must make cuts where to pay for an additional cost-of-living offer.“This is unaffordable and unsustainable for the sector and the EIS-FELA should suspend its strike action and recognise the instability their unwarranted strike action is causing to college students, who lose out the most from strikes.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857072.1547586318!/image/image.jpg","title":"alexander mccall smith all this talk about british identity is turning people irish","story":"Irish passports seem to have become rather popular for reasons that have something to do with current political issues around British identity, writes Alexander McCall Smith.In an age of identity politics, we are told that identity has once again become important. Francis Fukuyama – he who announced, prematurely, perhaps, the end of history – is certainly of this view, as he explains in his recent book, Identity. But it is not just in the political arena that identity has been a much-discussed topic: philosophers have long been concerned with the problem of personal identity and what makes us the same person across time . As a philosopher might put it, is pthe same entity at t as at t  To which Joxer Daly, the inimitable bar-room philosopher of Seán O’Casey’s Juno and the Paycock, might say: “That’ s the question, Captain! That’s the question!”Joxer Daly was quintessentially Irish, as was O’Casey. And that ties in with my theme of Irishness, in that I have been thinking recently about how many people have suddenly become Irish. An old friend of mine, whom I had always believed to have been Welsh to begin with, and who then became Scottish by habit and repute – to use the old term of informal marriage in Scots law – suddenly announced that he was Irish and acquired an Irish passport to prove it. This, of course, was something to do with the recent political uncertainties surrounding British and indeed Scottish identity, into which we do not currently need to go. Suffice it to say that he had identied an Irish grandmother and acquired his new nationality on the strength of that.Irish grandmothers are very useful. Many people who did not know that they had an Irish grandmother are now discovering that they have one, and writing off for their new Irish passports on the strength of that. Others who may not have ready access to an Irish grandmother have been investigating the possibility of acquiring one, and have, in many cases, succeeded in finding perfectly serviceable Irish grandmothers at very little cost. This process reminds one of the wonderful scene in di Lampedusa’s novel, The Leopard, in which the wealthy parvenu to Sicilian society is introduced as a man who has many distinguished ancestors, or,he does not currently have them, will surely have some soon.: Brexit: Voting down Theresa May’s deal is in national interest – Ian Murray MPIrish grandmothers come in the living or dead category. There is a strong argument against acquiring a living Irish grandmother, as this may involve future expenditure in terms of birthday presents and so on. Deceased grandmothers are more convenient in every respect, and cannot in any event challenge your assertion that you are their grandchild. This is important when you are applying for your Irish passport, as it can delay mattersthe grandmother on which you base your claim appears to have no knowledge of your existence. You can try putting this down to forgetfulness on her part, but that may be dficult to establish.How do you establish your Irishness for passport purposes  Many people, without a great deal of Irish ancestry in their past, are put off from applying because they fear that documentary evidence will be required, and they have none. This is unnecessarily defeatist: Irish Consulates are usually very agreeable places, staffed by charming persons of impeccable Irishness, and usually more than happy to help. I’m sure, in most cases, they will take you at your word, andyou insist that you are Irish and do so in a reasonably credible way, they will come up with the passport bypost . But do not overdo it. Some applicants go to the consular authorities dressed entirely in green. This is not advisable, as Irish consular officials can usually see through that sort of thing. All is required is the occasional phrase that indicates Irishness, such as “Would you look at that sky now. Sure, aren’t we in for a spot of rain, so we are.” That will do it. Do not attempt to speak Irish to the officials, nor to fill in your form in Irish, unless you are skilled in the language. You may end up applying in Early Irish, which is quite dferent from the modern language, and being given, as a consequence, an Early Irish passport, which is of very little use.: Brexit: Huge poll shows % favour second referendumOn the subject of grandmothers, the question might be asked: “If an Irish grandmother is so useful, of what use is a Scottish grandmother ” This is a very interesting question, the answer to which is that a Scottish grandmother will entitle you to play rugby for Scotland. Many people are unaware of this rule, which is applied with generosity and admirable consistency by the Scottish Rugby Union. If you have such a grandmother, then you are entitled to play rugby for Scotland and, furthermore, entitled to be selected. This rule applies whether or not you have any knowledge of the game, although caution should be exercised before putting yourself on the national team. Rugby is a contact sport, and not everybody enjoys that sort of contact.Going back to the newly Irish.

But we are not.As the leader of the UK Government, she has spent the last two-and-a-half years developing a plan to fulfil the result of the Brexit referendum and leave the European Union. And, on this most important issue, she has failed. And failed spectacularly.Her Brexit deal met the biggest defeat for a British Government in more than a century, eclipsing the record of  held by Ramsay McDonald in .But the crises of recent times utterly pale in comparison to the situation Britain faces today. And, regardless of The Scotsman’s view, it appears likely that May will win a confidence motion in the Commons today, a bizarre prediction in keeping with the growing bizarreness of the situation.Ahead of last night’s vote, May told the Commons that her deal was the only option. After the vote, she said she would hold talks with MPs, thento the EU, suggesting she would look for another option. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, noted the vote “with regret” and urged the UK to “clary its intentions as soon as possible”. One of the first things May should do – assuming she does survive today’s vote – is seek an extension of Article  because, as Juncker said, “time is almost up”. We need more of it. And the EU should accept that request. It would be in the economic interests of both parties, and also their political interests.: Theresa May’s Brexit deal overwhelmingly rejected by MPsSigns that the UK, one of the world’s biggest economies, is struggling to leave will act as a warning to other EU states thinking of doing the same.During that extension, May will clearly try to find a solution to break the impasse, but it seems unlikely the EU will make any signicant concessions.The  referendum was a hugely isive event, but the Government has done its best, in dficult circumstances, to honour the result. Unfortunately, there was always an element of fantasy about the promises of a “have our cake and eat it” deal from the likes of Boris Johnson. Regrettably, Jeremy Corbyn appears to have joined the fantasists’ ranks, claiming the UK could have a deal of that ilkonly he were Prime Minister.So it’s understandable that the vision which persuaded  per cent of people to back Brexit has not been turned into reality. And that means the Brexit question has now changed and, therefore, it requires a new answer from the people, expressed in a second EU referendum.: Brexit: Time for wishful thinking is over, Irish Government warns UKHowever, there are dangers associated with this course of action. Brexiteers who believed the issue was settled in  may feel aggrieved – and with some justication. There is a risk that some will boycott the vote, undermining the result. Others may decide that democracy has been betrayed and may – wrongly –conclude that unrest is therefore justied.Make no mistake, a badly handled second referendum would pose a serious threat to law and order in this country. Faith in democracy, a most important thing, could be badly damaged.In order to minimise the chaos involved, the question would have to be agreed with leading Brexiteers. Given a clear majority of MPs are opposed to a no-deal Brexit, hard Brexiteers may actually be sympathetic towards a second referendum that offers this choice as it seems like the only way this could happen. Speaking last night, Nigel Farage appeared open to the idea and suggested Leave would win a second referendum.Any ‘People’s Vote’ could not be a Remain stitch-up – or be seen to be one.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857068.1547586294!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland faces loss of a modernist masterpiece martyn mclaughlin","story":"The demise of St Peter#s Seminary near Cardross would rob Scotland of an architectural wonder, writes Martyn McLaughlin.It was never intended as a great secular pilgrimage – quite the opposite, in fact – butyou veer off Carman Road, a country lane which ekes its way up the north bank of the Clyde, you can still discover one of the country’s th century marvels.When I first visited the former St Peter’s Seminary two decades ago, the path was less certain. Overhanging branches of yew trees obscured the route, with the invasive species of contemporary Scotland – glass Buckfast bottles and empty Tennents cans – dubious navigational aids. Along the way, however, there were abundant hints of wonder: sandstone gorges spanned by moss-flecked stone bridges, the ruins of a th century castle, and walled gardens which nature had long since robbed of their Victorian order.Yet nothing quite compared to the final reveal, when the unruly woodland seemed to thin out and bow in quiet reverence before the seminary itself, a building so out of place and time it makes Cardross feel like Scotland’s answer to Roswell.It is a journey that has been made over the past three decades by countless artists, designers, and writers intent on savouring a contested architectural masterpiece in person. How sad it is we can offer future generations no guarantee of following in their footsteps.The news coverage of St Peter’s earlier this week will be wearily familiar to those who have championed the building’s merits over the years. Its owners, the Catholic Church of Scotland, conceded it was in a state of limbo and faced an “impossible situation” in trying to secure a future for the site.: Church warns it is in impossible situation over seminary ‘albatross’Such a quandary has defined St Peter’s almost from its opening in . At its peak, it only ever housed little more than half the number of trainee priests it was intended for. By the time the Second Vatican Council decreed that the community, rather than isolated cloisters, was the best place for their education, the building’s fate was sealed.A short-lived rebirth as a drug rehabilitation centre offered some respite, but a building designed to do God’s work eventually went to the devil. In the years that passed, a host of unrealised solutions for St Peter’s were floated, but they were either drearily lumpenor fancul .Only in the past decade did a thoughtful and pragmatic blueprint emerge courtesy of Angus Farquhar’s NVA, one of Scotland’s most energetic and ambitious arts organisations. It moved mountains to turn St Peter’s into an arts and community facility through partial restoration and consolidation of the abandoned and careworn structure.Having secured millions of pounds in backing, it restored scores of the seminary’s vaults and rid it of hazardous material, even offering a hint of what might be possible with Hinterland, a spectacular  art installation which harnessed St Peter’s desolation as well as its energy.: Joyce McMillan: The closure of NVA is immensely sad, but the company leaves a lasting legacySadly, such promise went unfulfilled with NVA’s collapse last summer. The reasons for its demise are numerous, but included increased costs within the capital funding package and uncertainty over whether a Scottish Government loan could be repaid over the next quarter of a century. The nail in the coffin was being turned down for long-term funding by Creative Scotland, which put paid to any alternative plans for the site. Now, with St Peter’s abandoned once more, the church has described it as a “huge albatross around our neck”.Ronnie Convery, communications director at the Archdiocese of Glasgow, explained: “We can’t sell it, we can’t give it away, we can’t demolish it. We are in a Catch  situation. We would literally give it away for nothing but we can’t find anyone to take it off our hands.”On the one hand, the church deserves sympathy for its reluctant stewardship of the A-listed white elephant. It has indeed tried to give away the building, only for potential suitors to realise the extent of their obligations.Yet the church must also realise that even the promise of handing over an internationally signicant treasure for free is not enough. It will cost several million pounds on top of what NVA spent simply to make St Peter’s safe, and there are few bodies with that kind of money to spare. One of them, however, is the Archdiocese of Glasgow. It is currently sitting on more than £m in funds, as well as fixed assets and investment properties with a net book value of nearly £m. It is not duty bound to delve into its coffers to come to St Peter’s aid, but perhaps investing a modest sum towards its preservation is the only way it can finally be freed of its burden.There are glimmers of hope. Argyll and Bute Council has designated the land surrounding the seminary as an “area for action”, while Historic Environment Scotland is currently considering viable options for the building’s future at the behest of Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop.Granted, the local authority barely has two pennies to rub together, while the quango is not in the business of saving derelict shells for the nation.Butthey and the church can work together, it may help broker some kind of compromise.

A Holyrood inquiry is to be established into the case that has rocked Scottish politics as revelations continue to emerge over secret meetings between the SNP#s two most senior figures about the claims.Relations between Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor have degenerated into open hostility amid claims of a “smear campaign” by the former leader, who alleges some iniduals are out to remove him as a political threat. A special committee of MSPs will be set up to look into the collapse of the government investigation after allegations by two women about Mr Salmond. He denies the claims. A separate police investigation in ongoing.The inquiry will examine the meetings between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond while the Holyrood inquiry was under way and the process used by the civil service in handling the complaints. The new Holyrood investigation comes on top of an inquiry by an external  of advisers into potential breaches of the ministerial code of conduct after Ms Sturgeon referred herself to this body. A \u2028spokesman for Mr Salmond said: “Alex will be happy to co-operate, in principle andasked, with a parliamentary inquiry which seeks to examine how the administration of the Scottish Government could get itself into a position where the Court of Session had to rule that it had acted ‘unlawfully’, ‘unfairly’ and ‘tainted by apparent bias’.“We believe the Permanent Secretary should already have accepted the responsibility for that expensive farce, which has cost the Scottish people an estimated £,.“Everyone, those who complain and those complained about, has the right to the protection of a procedure which is fair, balanced, confidential and above all lawful.”The First Minister has previously made it clear she would co-operate with any inquiry held by MSPs into the case. The investigation was agreed by all parties on Holyrood’s business bureau yesterday, including the SNP.The SNP hierarchy has been plunged into open warfare after the collapse last week of a government internal inquiry into Mr Salmond over claims from female civil servants of sexual harassment relating to his time as first minister. Holyrood officials will prepare options on its remit and membership, which is likely to include measures to ensure it does not conflict with an active police investigation that is under way. The government conceded defeat last Tuesday after a legal challenge brought by Mr Salmond at the Court of Session when it emerged the head of the investigation, before being appointed, had been in contact with the women making the complaints about their cases.Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said: “An investigation has been botched, two complainants have been let down and hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money has been wasted.“These are clearly matters for the Scottish Parliament to investigate and the inquiry must be able to examine what went wrong and why this was allowed to happen.“The setting up of the inquiry does not mean that legitimate questions cannot be asked – or answered – in the short term.”He added: “This scandal cannot be swept under the carpet. Parliament must, and now will, get the chance to probe this matter fully, learn lessons and ensure it can never happen again.”The affair has seen relations between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon nosee, with the First Minister accusing her predecessor of a “smear campaign” over the meetings.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described news of the Holyrood inquiry as a “positive step forward”.He said: “Full transparency in this matter is essential in order for the public to have confidence in the First Minister and the Scottish Government. That means full public and parliamentary scrutiny.“At all times it is essential to remember that at the centre of all of this are two courageous women who put their faith in a system that has badly let them down and we must never lose sight of that by safeguarding the duty of care to them and their access to justice.“We must restore trust and confidence in the system.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the police investigation must be the priority. “These complaints deserve to be thoroughly investigated by the police without political interference,” he said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857402.1547647635!/image/image.jpg","title":"higher fares could be introduced on scottish ferries to manage tourists","story":"Ticket prices on some ferry services could be increased to help mitigate high demand at peak times, the Transport Secretary has said.Speaking at Holyrood’s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee on Wednesday, Michael Matheson said peak-time pricing could be introduced to better manage capacity.Increased tourist numbers during the summer period have been highlighted as a key concern for island residents, who have previously indicated dficulties in acquiring a ticket to travel during busy spells.Scottish Conservative MSP for the North East Peter Chapman asked Mr Matheson what measures are being considered to help ease dficulties during periods of high demand.Mr Chapman said: “We know that there’s been huge pressures on services, particularly during the summer with increased tourism.“And that’s fine, but it has meant that sometimes locals have been unable to get a ticket to get off the island at short notice.“There has been some talk about consideration of demand management measures to help alleviate pressure at peak times.

So for example, it could be the option of higher fares at peak times or it could be the option of incentives at off-peak times, where there’s capacity on the ferry.“Is there a way in which we can try to sht some of that demand to utilise the resource much more effectively “So there’s a iety of dferent things we could look at there to try and help to deal with some of the additional demand.”Mr Matheson added that any move to introduce peak-fare pricing would not necessarily apply to all routes and would be done in consultation with communities impacted by ferry services. - Met Office issues yellow weather warning for Scotland as snow and ice set to hit“One of the things I think is particularly important here is that it’s not something that may be necessary on every route,” he said.“It may be just on some specic routes at specic times, there’s a need for some sort of demand management arrangements to be put in place.“Anything around this will be looked at on that basis.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8768911.1547477230!/image/image.jpg","title":"antrim emergency department under extreme pressure","story":"The Northern Health and Social Care Trust has issued advice to residents as  people continue to wait for beds at Antrim Area Hospital.

The North Antrim DUP MP told the News Letter that the “continuous campaign of terror” waged by the IRA had “stunted the economic growth” of Northern Ireland.“It is convenient for nationalists to ignore this as their ideology benighted from its consequences,” he added. “Despite the  years of terror, NI has survived, now boasts the lowest levels of unemployment in our history, the highest levels of inward investment outside of London and is a hub for many key businesses.

The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Why  Because De Gaulle called it right. England doesn’t belong in Europe, remains Atlanticist, attached to imperial preference, consumed by the ‘great-game’ of ide-and-rule, of balancing powers in Europe, never committed to “ever closer union”, focused on financial chicanery over agriculture and manufacturing. Was De Gaulle wrong  After the illusion of the Edward Heath era, Britain was only ever in Europe to disrupt it. That game is now up.Whether through opt-outs or rebates, through Maastrict and Lisbon, England’s subsequent conduct in Europe has been as drag-weight and chief saboteur. On reunication, Francois Mitterrand sought to bind Helmut Kohl’s Germany to deepen the European core. British diplomacy embraced Eastern Europe to widen, make shallow and reduce it to free-trading nations. England weighed in under Ireland’s Pat Cox’s cloak to undermine the Commission, the EU’s centre of gravity. And the Jacques Delors social-Europe of the s gave way, under English influence, to free-market liberalism.Things turned with the creation of the Euro. Decisions, increasingly, were taken by the Eurozone. The capacity to disrupt waned, the mileage for further meddling ran out. Whether Little-England or Global Britain, Brexit was the means to get out, to save its soul, or lose the sense of itself. Will England’s dficulty be Northern Ireland’s opportunity I hope so. Northern Ireland is a profoundly dysal polity. Alone in Europe we cannot elect thegovernment. We can’t vote Labour. Conservatives don’t seek a mandate here. We can’t elect the government and more importantly, we can’t chuck a bad government out.Voting in the Northern Ireland entity is like going into the bookies and being told you can back any horse you want – except the horses that might win. We can vote for losers all day long, but not winners. After  years of Northern Ireland, we remain a quarantined zone, the UK’s political slum. Local government is through a Stormont-based native-council, or what apartheid-era South Africans called a Bantustan. Well subsidised, maybe, but a Bantustan nonetheless.As a long-time campaigner to normalise politics within the UK, that avenue is long closed, over, dead. The Brexit vote has allowed us to throw the balls in the air. ‘Creative-chaos’, the policy wonks call it. Or Tony Blair’s prophetic words, to shake the kaleidoscope, and re-order our world. After a change of government, a hard Brexit will allow us to re-join Europe through a border-poll. A hard Brexit will allow us to join an independent Irish state, whose government we can, at least, elect. A border poll, for people like me, is a vote to get the vote # for the first time ever. I’d do that in a heartbeat.The Deltapoll online poll published in September  asked the question: “Imagine now that the UK decided to leave the EU. Under these circumstances how would you vote in a referendum on the constitutional arrangements of the island of Ireland ”More than half, %, said they would vote for a united Ireland, while % said they would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. In the event of a ‘hard’ Border, % said they would vote for unity, with only % voting to remain in the UK.The most recent Lucidpoll, published in December found, in the event of a ‘No-Deal’ Brexit, % would vote for unity, with only % to remain in the UK.These polling figures are unparalleled since partition.A hard Brexit will hasten the break up of the UK in other ways. Scotland will have a second independence vote, a second penalty kick to drt off, politically, towards Scandinavia. Whether they have the cojones to do so remains to be seen, but my vote for creative chaos gives them the chance.Hard Brexit will see the City of London diminish. The apex of an imbalanced economy, the ‘City’ is, effectively, a criminal paradise facilitating money-laundering, tax-evasion and the myriad dodgy financial products of predatory casino capitalism. Economists like the ’s Larry Elliot believe the shock-treatment of EU withdrawal could force Britain to focus on developing the real, productive, manufacturing base required to re-balance the economy. What’s not to like Whether Little England or Global Britain, the UK is splintering.And we, locked in the Northern Ireland entity, may soon be admitted to the franchise.

Mrs May has called for politicians to back her deal or risk letting the British people down. But with many of her own MPs expected to join opposition parties to vote against the deal, it is widely expected to be defeated.MPs will also be able to suggest amendments that could reshape the deal before voting commences this evening.Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald TD has said the EU backstop cannot be set aside or diluted.Speaking from Stormont after she and Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O’Neill met leaders of the north’s main political parties, Mary Lou McDonald said: #Whatever transpires at Westminster it is essential that Irish interests are protected that the economy is protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected in all its parts.#We have commitments from our partners at an EU level that the needs of this island north and south have been recognised and will be protected. Sinn Féin expects those commitments to be honoured and that is what we have been making clear to the Irish government and the EU.#There is no such thing as a good Brexit but the backstop is the bottom line. Anyone who imagines that can be unpicked or diluted or set aside isn#t dealing with the political realities. The DUP position on Brexit is reckless and irresponsible. It certainly is not in the interests of the people of the north of Ireland. I would urge all political leaders to act in the interests of workers, of communities, of society and political stability.”DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said that Mrs May should ask for and deliver changes to a Withdrawal Agreement. Despite a letter of supposed reassurance from the EU, he saidthere are “no legally binding assurances” as the Prime Minister talked about in December.“In fact, there is nothing new, nothing has changed,” he said. “Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns by confirming that everything the Attorney General said in his legal advice regarding the backstop, still stands, there has been no change to the Withdrawal Agreement and Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels. We would rely on the Dublin government to speak up for us. I stead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"patricias latest work set to banish january blues with latest work","story":"MONDAY morning and a trip across the city to the old Belfast politan College on Tower Street ,whose beauty and hair salon is proving the perfect rehearsal space for Patricia Gormley’s latest work ‘Is That Too Hot ’Set in the world of hairdryers, rollers, straighteners and all things beauty, the hilarious sequel to ‘I’ll Tell My Ma’ is heading to The MAC stage this month to lt our spirits during the post-holiday slump.West Belfast scribe Patricia, who has performed her work across the city on many stages from the Cultúrlann to the Lyric, in her new play traces the antics of Granny Eileen, Davina Carina and Cha Marie as they stumble their way through another year in their ever turbulent lives as they pop in and out of their local hairdressers for a cuppa, a ‘curly blowdry’ and a catch-up.Starring Christina Nelson, who brought Patricia’s work and characters to le on the Lyric stage last year, and Roisin Gallagher, both actors told Daily Belfast how audiences are in for a treat when curtain comes up.“I play the character of Olive, in whose salon the stories of each character unfold in,” explained Roisin. “Olive has her own drama going on which the audience find out about throughout the piece. It is based on a real le person and hairdressers in the heart of West Belfast. It’s a brilliant observational piece and it’s a story about what happens at the heart of any community that has people who are lonely, struggling, having relationship problems and maybe don’t have anyone to speak to and are coming to this place for their own needs once a week. As Olive says in the play, “This place is like a psychiatrist’s couch, only they get to sit in a swivel chair. The character of Olive hears more about what is going on than the priest,” she laughed.Fresh from her stint as the white rabbit in the Lyric’s Alice the Musical, Christina Nelson is preparing to transform once again into a iety of roles for this sequel. “Granny Eileen, feisty as ever, is back, bless her, back from Turkey where she had a great old time. Cha Marie is back and Patricia has written a new character, Mrs Hughes, who is a bit of a prickly one and worth a watching.”Christina continued: “The energy with Roisin is brilliant, we are working brilliantly together and we are working our socks off to make sure those coming to see us will be laughing in their seats.“So much of everyday le is heard and discussed in the hairdressers, some people even just go to sit under the dryer to get a bit of heat, get a cup of tea brought to them. It’s very much a social thing and they are very much embedded throughout communities.”When asked about plans for a trilogy, Christina revealed that Patricia is “writing as we speak.” “Granny Eileen will definitely be back and there is more to come for these characters.”The new production will reunite Roisin with her recent Bah, Humbug! co-star Alan McKee, who this time will be sitting in the director’s chair. The former St Genevieve’s High School pupil will also be bringing her own work to The MAC stage in March with the self-penned Natural Disaster. “I wrote this piece, it’s what I would call a creative documentation, after my daddy passed away last Christmas. It’s like a journey through grief and I had documented things during that time that were said whether they were funny and sad. It’s not all doom and gloom, though, it’s how we look at grief, how we carry it with us and it will be great to perform it at The MAC following our run with this show.”“You can’t help but fall in love with these characters,” said Roisin. “It’s the perfect tonic for people needing a lt in January to put their worries away for an hour or two and come and see the show.”Is That Too Hot runs at The MAC from January  until February .

A total of  Tory rebels, including staunch Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg and former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab, joined Remainers Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve in voting against the Government.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the \"catastrophic\" defeat represented an \"absolutely decisive\" verdict by MPs on Mrs Mays handling of Brexit.He then moved to table a motion of no-confidence in the Government - but without the support of the DUP it is set to fail.Mrs Fosters party last night confirmed it will be supporting the Prime Minister in todays vote.

The DUP leader insisted that Parliament had \"acted in the best interests of the entire UK\" when it voted against the Withdrawal Agreement.\"The House of Commons has sent an unmistakable message to the Prime Minister and the EU that this deal is rejected,\" Mrs Foster said. \"Mrs May will now be able to demonstrate to the Brussels negotiators that changes are requiredany deal is to command the support of Parliament. We will work with the Government constructively to achieve a better deal. That is our focus.\"Mrs Foster continued: \"Whilst some may wish to use this defeat to boost their political ambitions, we will give the Government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal. \"Reassurances, whether in the form of letters or warm words, will not be enough. \"The Prime Minister must now go back to the EU and seek fundamental change to the Withdrawal Agreement. \"We want an orderly exit from the European Union with a sensible deal which works for Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\" DUP MP Sammy Wilson confirmed his party would be backing the Government today. \"We will vote against the Labour Partys confidence motion,\" he told the BBC.\"We want to see the Conservative Government continuing to deliver on Brexit ... we never wanted a change of government.

In a statement, the Dublin administration said: \"The Irish government continues to believe that ratication of this Agreement is the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK, which avoids a hard border and respects the single market and Customs Union, while also delivering on the UKs objectives for withdrawal. \"Regrettably, the outcome ofvote increases the risk of a disorderly Brexit. Consequently, the government will continue to intensy preparations for such an outcome.\"The Irish government said its cabinet discussed preparation for a no-deal Brexit in detail yesterday. \"Cabinet took a number of signicant decisions, including the preparation of essential legislative measures as part of this ongoing work,\" it added.\"This work will intensy over the next few weeks.\" In the statement, Dublin insisted it was \"not too late\" to avoid a disorderly Brexit and called for the UK to set out how it will resolve the impasse \"as a matter of urgency\"."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster urges pm to seek better deal from eu","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But she appeared to leave the door open to an extension to buy more time for negotiations.Asked by Tory grandee Ken Clarke whether she would “mody her red lines” and extend Article , Mrs May said: “The Government’s policy is that we are leaving the EU on March , but the European Union would only extend Article actually it was clear that there was a plan that was moving towards an agreed deal.“That is the crucial element of ensuring we deliver on Brexit.”Following the vote on Tuesday evening, the Prime Minister said she wanted to hold talks with senior parliamentarians to try to find an agreed way forward ahead of a fresh statement to the House on Monday.However shadow chancellor John McDonnell complained that she had not invited Mr Corbyn or any of the other party leaders for talks.After Downing Street said she remained committed to securing an “independent trade policy” – effectively ruling out a customs union which Labour supports – he warned the discussions may not even get off the ground.“She is now laying conditions down about those discussions which look as though they will prevent any discussion of a permanent customs union,” Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“That is what most of the other opposition parties support so she seems to be negating the discussions before they have even started.”The Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said Mrs May was committed to meeting with MPs who were committed to “constructively” delivering on the EU referendum vote.However she said Mr Corbyn had failed to produce any positive proposals and was simply seeking to “disrupt” the Government by trying to force a general election at a crucial time for the country .“I don’t think she has written him off at all but he needs to come to the table and tell us what he wants to do,” she told the Today programme.“He has not put forward any specic constructive proposal and that is a problem, which is why the Prime Minister will be engaging right across the House with those who do have very sincerely held views but want to constructively deliver on what the vast majority of parliamentarians voted for.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Andrea Leadsom has said Jeremy Corbyn’s approach is ‘a problem’ Mrs Leadsom indicated the Prime Minister was still hoping to build support for a Brexit plan which preserved key elements of the existing deal.“What we need to do is to find a way that that deal or some part of it or an alternative that is negotiablecan be put to the European Union so that we can get this Brexit through by March ,” she said.However, former minister Sir Oliver Letwin – one of the architects of plan by senior Tories to give MPs a greater say in the process – warned she would have to be more flexible.“She put down right at the beginning of this process what she called red lines,” he told the BBC.“This is not a terrain in which you can have things you will definitely never do. You have to sit down and talk and come up with a consensus. That means being much more flexible than we have been so far.”Steve Baker, one of the leaders of the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, said Mrs May must now abandon the controversial Northern Ireland “backstop” intended to prevent theof a hard border with the republic.“We are not going to be able to agree to the backstop. It is obvious when you look at the vote last night. There is no getting away from it. That was an absolutely devastating blow,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Michel Barnier said it is up the UK to explain how it wants to proceed The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he “profoundly” regretted the Commons vote and that it was now up to the British Government to say how it intended to proceed.“An orderly withdrawal will remain our absolute priority in the coming weeks,” he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg.He said there would be a “favourable response” from the EU sideMrs May was prepared to re-think her red lines and seek a more “ambitious” deal with Brussels, but he was adamant the backstop had to remain part of any agreement.“The backstop which we agreed to with the UK must remain a backstop. It must remain a credible backstop,” he said.That view was echoed by Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney who said Dublin was not prepared to consider alternatives to a backstop which it had taken two years to negotiate.“We’re not going to allow physical border infrastructure to reappear,” he told RTE.“I don’t think the EU is in any mood to change the Withdrawal Agreement signicantly at all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"artist creates installation to play totos africa for eternity in namib desert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The artwork consists of an MP player containing only Africa, which was first released as a single in , linked to six speakers.“The song is put on loop and the installation runs on solar batteries to keep Toto going for all eternity,” Siedentopf wrote on his website.Siedentopf said the artwork was inspired by the ever growing popularity of the song, which was recently covered by both Weezer and Pitbull and has become a staple of bizarre internet cover versions and memes.He told NPR: “I was very intrigued by this and wanted to pay the song the ultimate homage and physically exhibit ‘Africa’ in Africa.“The Namibian desert — which is, with  million years, the oldest desert in the world — seemed to be the perfect spot for this.”Should fans wish to track the artwork down, Siedentopf has included a map to its approximate location on his website.That approximate location seems to take in the entire Namib desert, but the fact that Siedentopf grew up in Windhoek and installed the work while visiting family in Namibia might give a clue to a starting point for any search.This isn’t the first time that hard rotation of the Toto single has hit the headlines.Just a few weeks ago, DJ Michael Savage organised a charity club night in Bristol in which he played Africa on a loop for  hours."},{"url":null,"title":"nike unveils selflacing shoes controllable from a smartphone","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour. Jousting is a distinct possibility and so are a number of other unusual dimensions.Although it will be called St Patrickrsquos Festival, the steering committee believe that a Maytime date would be better favoured by the weather than one on March  and would allow them to provide a much wider range of outdoor and indoor attractions.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Stormont Minister is to be asked to prevent the extension of a caravan park near Killyleagh.The unprecedented step is being taken by Down Council in protest against a recommendation made by planners to allow the development at East Down Yacht Club.

She always kept a respectful distance unless you had some Nutella.Describing the vixen as very friendly, Aileen continued: ldquoOne of the ladies I play with always kept food in her bag. She would lt out a banana and tried to feed Donny but she only turned her nose up at that.ldquoI happened to have a Nutella wafer bar so I gave it to her and she ate it right out of my hand.Donny was discovered nursing a badly infected wound. Animal rescuer Debbie Nelson from Debbie Dolittle Wildle was called in and quickly realised the fox had a raging infection.Debbie said: ldquoI managed to get her to the vet before it closed.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with.

Part of Irish Street was sealed off, spaces in the nearby car park were temporarily unavailable, contractors were working in Market Street and much of the Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water.ldquoThere were ious causes for these issues from early delivery of stone pavements for Irish Street works, flood water in the town and emergency work to kerbs, but we must have better coordination between authorities and there must simply be better communication with businesses in the town.Mr McGrath said he has written to businesses and forwarded his contact details should there be further issues as a temporary one-way traffic system comes into operation in Irish Street during work on the environmental improvement scheme.ldquoI have also written to the districtrsquos isional roads manager outlining my concerns. Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas. Why should Downpatrick Mr McGrath said he wanted assurances that communication with the business community will improve and that work which has the potential to disrupt businesses will be kept to the absolute bare minimum over the coming weeks in Irish Street.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the environmental improvement scheme which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the work to facilitate the contractor.The work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year and is designed to help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents.Politicians are also confident the scheme can help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment over many years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Jane Coyne’s The Suitcase comes to Down Arts Centre  ","story":"DOWN Arts Centre is hosting The Suitcase next month.The highly acclaimed production by Jane Coyle takes to the stage on Sunday, February , at pm and tickets are now available.The play was premiered at the Belfast synagogue for the  Belfast International Arts Festival and won the Audience Award.Now, in response to popular demand, it is being revived and toured around Northern Ireland during this yearrsquos Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations.The storyline moves between s Vienna and modern day Belfast.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers. We need to ensure there is enough resource to accommodate ferry traffic flow and demand to minimise the impact on Strangford residents.Cllr Billy Walker suggested the provision of a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry should perhaps be considered.Cllr Enrightrsquos motion was also supported by Cllrs Willie Clarke, Jill Macauley and John Trainor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Mahon Cup success for disciplined St Michael’s  ","story":"THE final of the long-standing Mahon Cup was played out before an appreciative crowd in the Drumaness clubrooms just before Christmas.In the final were holders St Michaelrsquos from Downpatrick and Queenrsquos Hall from Newtownards.League sponsor Gary Rodgers conducted the draw for the match pairings, which saw Gareth McKeever up first against Alastair McDonald and Bobby Douglas taking on Keith Lemon.McDonald got into his stride the quicker and soon built up a good lead over Gareth at  points to .

There was no school reputation, no building, no funding, no resources. They were unbelievable and were really pioneering.Naturally delighted with the honour mdash the first in her family mdash Mrs Roulston says that she shares it with a lot of people.ldquoThroughout my career, I have worked alongside so many wonderful and dedicated people, committed to making a dference to the lives of the children and to ensuring that they received the very best possible education in the widest sense of the word mdash teachers, assistants, dinner ladies, caretakers, volunteer parents and members of the board of governors, etc, she said.ldquoSo, on the day that I receive my MBE, I will be paying honour to all the people I have known and worked with and all those from other schools and sectors who show dedication and commitment to the children in our schools.The little people who she had the pleasure of teaching until she retired in  will always have a special place in  year-old Mrs Roulstonrsquos heart.ldquoI would like to thank all the children, those I have taught and also those whom I had the pleasure of knowing for all that they have taught me, for the pleasure they have given me throughout my career, for all the funny things they said or did which brightened up my day, for their kindness to me in all the drawings and little hand-made crafts they made for me.Originally from outside Manchester, Mrs Roulston has lived and worked in the south Down area from the late s after marrying her husband, Mervyn.After teaching practice in England and teaching in two very dferent schools in France, Mrs Roulston taught for some years in Greyabbey and Portavogie Primary Schools, as well as the Rupert Steiner School in Belfast, before taking a career break while raising her three sons mdash John, Peter and Timothy mdash in Kircubbin.ldquoI did a lot of cross-community work at that time as chair of the parent and toddler group, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoI also formed and chaired a community association and did a lot of work together cross community to get facilities for Kircubbin. It wasnrsquot a paid job but it was an important part of everything and I believe itrsquos where I first understood that cross-community work was so important.While working in Portaferry Primary School in the late s, she was fascinated on learning about a group of parents in Carryduff campaigning for an integrated primary school.ldquoI was reading all about it in the local newspaper and it was very interesting to me, but it was hot and heavy as well as there was lot of objection to the school, she said.ldquoI never dreamt that I would apply for it or have anything to do with it. But I did apply as it was a teaching principalship and it was working with both sides of the community as all the work I had done with cross-community work just kept saying to me, lsquoThis is really important work, this needs to be done to break down barriersrsquo.The road to establishing Millennium was far from smooth, however, as the grandmother of three can testy.ldquoYou just wouldnrsquot believe the terrible trouble we had and itrsquos hard to believe now what happened, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoDays before we were due to open, I had  primary ones and no funding and no site as there was a lot of opposition to establishing the school where we had originally planned to in the Carryduff area.ldquoWe ended up down at Breda Park, close to Forestside in Belfast in an old heath trust building. We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

The House of Commons has sent an unmistakable message to the Prime Minister and the European Union that this deal is rejected.“Mrs May will now be able to demonstrate to the Brussels’ negotiators that changes are requiredany deal is to command the support of Parliament.“We will work with the Government constructively to achieve a better deal. That is our focus. Whilst some may wish to use this defeat to boost their political ambitions, we will give the Government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal.”Taking to Twitter after MPs voted, Ms O’Neill posted: “Brexit crisis has deepened further tonight. No Deal crash out is completely reckless  not in our peoples, households or businesses interests. Backstop is the bottom line and is not up for negotiation.”Mr Swann said the result of the vote in the House of Commons had been “inevitable and entirely predictable.”“The Prime Minister and the team around her have been trying to resurrect their doomed withdrawal agreement for weeks. They weren’t listening despite the will of Parliament, in opposition to this agreement, being clear for weeks,” he said.“Attempts to manipulate this vote to be a decision between a bad deal and no deal were desperate in the extreme and have clearly backfired resulting in an emphatic defeat for the Government.“Instead of more preication and reckless negotiating tactics the UK Government needs to recalibrate its negotiating position, grab this process by the scruff of the neck and seek an extension to Article . Then get the EU back to the negotiating table. The debate has clearly shown that there is no desire amongst the majority of MPs for a no deal Brexit.“The EU’s claims that they want to defend the Belfast Agreement must now be backed up by actions that reflect their responsibility. The backstop needs dealt with and they know it. If they continue with their present intransigence, everyone will end up in a place where no-one wants to go.”MPs reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mrs Long said the margin of defeat for the government was “surprising”, adding: “Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit. The Brexit process has been defined by a flawed concept, incompatible red-lines, unrealistic expectations and imaginary solutions. Even today,  months on, there is still no clarity on what the UK wants in terms of Brexit.“Parliament last week rejected a no deal Brexit, recognising it would be disaster for the UK, and a catastrophe for Northern Ireland.“Now they have rejected the Withdrawal Agreement, despite the fact any negotiated Brexit will require a Withdrawal Agreement, including an open-ended, all weather backstop. This reality cannot be escaped or avoided. They have also comprehensively failed to offer any single alternative which commands a majority.“It is now clear the only coherent way forward is to have a People’s Vote. Democracy is an active process, and given what we now know and the ongoing deadlock, the people of UK must have the right to have their say.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood commented: “There is no such thing as a good Brexit butwe are forced to leave the EU then Northern Ireland must to be protected through a backstop.“The naive belief in Westminster that a better deal can be negotiated with Brussels is merely postponing the inevitable. That fact remains - there is no way to avoid a hard border in IrelandNorthern Ireland leaves the Customs Union and Single Market. That is why a backstop is essential. The SDLP have said this from day one. “Northern Ireland’s economy and stability can’t be sacriced because politicians in London have failed to recognise the obvious.”Reacting to the result of the vote on Twitter, TUV leader Jim Allister posted: “Mrs May’s treacherous deal gets its just deserts. It deserved no better. PM needs to present EU choice of ditch the Backstop or face No Deal. No more rollover.”try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownPrisoner on the loose in N.I.N.I. manwith dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help with dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help\"          ..

Pic by Arthur Allison, PacemakerThe admission came as British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered a historic defeat in the House of Commons on her Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.Mr Coveny’s comments came after Irish Transport Minister Shane Ross told journalists that he expects border checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.An independent member of the Irish Parliament, he had been asked about a situation where a lorry carrying food produce from Scotland arrived at the Irish border.Speaking during a briefing on the country’s contingency planning, he said: “I would anticipate that there would be checks.”...all of a sudden wersquoll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.Simon Coveney, Irish Deputy Prime MinisterSenior Irish politicians have said whatever the circumstances, the border would not be hardened.“Well no,” said Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney, intervening after Mr Ross answered, saying that the border would be dealt with through the orce deal.Mr Coveney said that the Government had “deliberately not” gone into contingency plans for dealing with the Border in a no-deal scenario because the UK had not voted on the plan.“If Britain leaves without a deal well, then we obviously have to dficult discussions with the European Commission and with the UK in terms of how we protect the EU single market,” he said.However, during a subsequent private conversation with Mr Ross, Mr Coveney confirmed that a form of checks will be introduced in a no-deal “but we can’t get into where they’ll be at this stage”.The admission came after Mr Ross bungled a question from the Irish Independent on whether in a no-deal scenario a truck coming from Scotland to Northern Ireland and then on to the Republic without any checks.Mr Coveney and Mr Ross were talking privately at the end of the press briefing without realising the microphone was still on:Colin Horner killing: Drama as four men are jailed for le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Shane Ross: “Yeah.

But once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we’ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.”Shane Ross: “Yeah, but I didn’t know what to say.”Asked by the BBCMr Ross had “let the cat out of the bag”, Fianna Fail Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers said Mr Ross was an independent TD who was outside the main parties and was “prone to gaffes”. Good Morning Ulster also asked herthe EU will now press the Republic to put physical checks on the border to protect the single market. Ms Chambers sidestepped the question and replied thatthe UK reverts to World Trade Organisation Rules “they will equally be under pressure to apply border checks” but added that aside from the Irish backstop “I don’t have an answer for you”.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson responded that it is “little wonder Simon Coveney might fear a no-deal backlash, because they will have been a primary architect of such an outcome arising,” he said. This could be avoidedDublin accepts minimum friction technological border checks, and political agreement, the DUP MP added.TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Coveney’s comments “reveal the truth that the threat of border posts comes not from the UK but from the EU forcing Dublin to do so”.He added: “If Dublin wants to avoid that then it is incumbent on them to press Brussels for Special Status for the Republic, which will allow it to keep the border open and protect its trading relationship with its most important partner - the UK”.The Irish government has been invited to comment.try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.N.I. manwith dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help with dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help\"          ..

Coming from a messenger which the party doesn’t respect, the message carried little weight.As the prime minister talked about Northern Ireland from the despatch box last night, the DUP’s MPs muttered and shook their heads.Without radical changes to the backstop, there was never any prospect of the DUP recanting on its opposition to this deal.But in recent days there have been glimpses of the internal debate which is now going on within the DUP as to what may happen now.Last week chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said that the party would consider “with interest” a proposal to commit the government to end the backstop within a year. But the party’s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said that such a pledge was so pointless that “you could sign it in blood and it wouldn’t mean anything”.Yesterday both Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster repeated their opposition to a no-deal Brexit, yet a year ago DUP MP Ian Paisley talked bullishly about leaving without a deal.A cannier prime minister would have sought to exploit the DUP’s dferent wings, which take in everyone from closet Remainers to ardent Brexiteers.But throwing money at them, as was in December reported to be one government line of thinking, won’t work.If the party sees this as a constitutional threat to the Union – the defence of which is the DUP’s raison d’être – then the acceptance of money or peerages or any other practical ‘gt’ would make an already dficult sell to the party’s supporters almost impossible because it would look like they had quite literally sold out on their central principles.Despite Theresa May’s deal being routed, DUP will still back herDublin minister expects border checks after no deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.N.I. manwith dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help with dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help\"          ..

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ob_1.jpg","title":"leaders in business owen brennan","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Owen Brennan, Devenish Nutrition In , Devenish Nutrition was an agri-feed business, established in Fermanagh, with around two dozen staff.In the  years since its takeover, Owen Brennan, executive chairman with the now global company – which has its headquarters in Belfast – has grown the business from a firm with annual revenues of £m, to an international business now doing that in a week.“By the time we got there it was well-established for over  years. The shareholders were looking for somebody to take the business to the next stage.“While the company was smaller at the time, they were really keen to see it grow from the Northern Ireland base.“The business has grown substantially. At that time, the Northern Ireland revenues were over % of the entire sales. Today they are less than %.”However, Northern Ireland revenues are around five times larger than when Owen took over the business.Devenish has round  staff – across  nationalities, which is roughly the size of the entire workforce  years ago. But it counts Northern Ireland as its main base, and remains a key element of the business. The company sells into more than  countries.“The most important metric is that we spend around £m a year on innovation projects,” he said.“The big focus in  was seeing a niche opportunity for a specialised, innovative nutrition product, full-service business.”It deals in animal feed supplements – specialised high-value nutrients in a small pack. It also makes diets for small animals at the early stage of their lives, along with specialised nutritional products.And Owen says while the public hears about the negative impact of livestock, the positive impact isn’t heard.In his time at Devenish, Owen has been handed several accolades, including winning the BelfastCup  at the Ulster Farmers’ Union annual dinner.  “I’ve always taken those awards very seriously, and it’s the reflection of the work of a lot of people. I might happen to be the person that ends up being the recipient, but that’s only possible because of the success of the overall business.”He says, while sounding like a cliche it’s “genuinely a team effort”. “Part of my interestis that I see the parallels between sport and business.“Who is the most important person on the rugby field … actually, it’s everybody. If you have one weakness in that  or match-day .“If you take that analogy into the business area. I was once asked by a mentor, who did I think were the most important people in the business at that time. I said I didn’t know.“But he said ‘the telephone receptionist and the lorry driver’. He said those two people, between them, have by far and away the most customer contact in our business. I’ve never forgotten that. And  years later, I find that to be true.”On Brexit, Owen says the position among businesses has remained consistent, with a majority opposed to the UK leaving the EU.“The three things which have emerged to date include the diminution in the value of sterling – that has been a very bad thing for business, generally.“… the second effect has been uncertainty… le is uncertain, as is business. But anything that adds a large uncertainty in a business environment is not good.“The third is maybe a little harder to define. I think the debate around this leaves a lot to be desired. “People have said to me that the focus on immigration has made a lot of people, that would be described in those debates as immigrants, feeling very uncomfortable.“We are an international business, and had got to used to thinking of that international dimension as a good and wholly positive thing, so to hear a debate with that emphasis, with that sort of connotation for people of an international background.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gibsn_1.jpg","title":"outlook  the year ahead has forecasting ever been harder","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Professor Neil Gibson, chief economist at EY Ireland says in two decades in the field, predicting the future has never been harder Forecasting is always a challenge but, in  years as a professional economist, I have never had less confidence in predicting the year ahead than I do now.  At the time of writing, the nature of the UK’s departure from the EU remains unclear. Estimates of the economic impact of ious exit scenarios ranged from -% in a catastrophic exit .Notably, all of the iants suggested a loss of GDP in the UK, though it also worth noting that GDP means virtually nothing to most of the voting public.  The prediction of % loss in house prices in the disorderly scenario is much more likely to focus minds. Moreover, Brexit is far from the only uncertainty ahead.  Trade wars are continuing, oil prices are slumping and stock markets are incredibly volatile. Many of the global warning lights have flicked from green to amber and it is entirely possible that  will be a very challenging year indeed. Despite the gloomy introduction, the base case forecasts continue to suggest a year of modest growth ahead. EY predicts a small contraction in the local labour market but most other forecasters disagree. This base case projection assumes a transition period is in place and that a global slow-down does not materialise:  two rather large assumptions to make. The optimism is partly borne out of what has been a remarkable period of job growth in Northern Ireland. The workforce jobs measure reports , net additional jobs have been created in the year to Q . This continues a trend that started in  and has seen the overall employment level rise by , since Q . This is despite very modest levels of recorded GDP growth and, finally, it has taken the region back above the total employment levels reached in . This performance is a credit to businesses throughout the region as, remarkably, all council areas have enjoyed job growth and all sectors outside of public administration have increased their headcounts since Q . The consumer is, perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the economy heading into . Inflation is running very close to UK average salary increases, which means that, on average, people are not getting richer. However, overall consumer spending has been rising – partly because there are more people in work and partly because people have been willing to run down savings or take on debt.The data shows NI to be particularly vulnerable in this regard, with higher proportions of people without savings . The fragile state of the economy means,  probably, that interest rate increases are unlikely, especially with falling oil prices easing inflation, but the impact of a change in consumer sentiment and spending behaviour would trigger a marked slow-down. Consumer confidence measures are inherently volatile but there are reasons to be concerned. Confidence surveys have been edging downwards – the UK credit conditions surveys suggest a tightening amongst lenders in  and savings ratiosare at historic lows. Consumer trends should be watched closely in early  as they will prove critical to overall economic performance. TRENDS TO WATCH IN There are a number of economic trends I would expect to see in :Continued retail transformation: it has been a dficult time on the high street as consumers move increasingly to on-line shopping. A number of high profile closures have taken a toll and we expect this pattern to continue.  This will, as all periods of change do, create winners and losers and will  place pressure further on an outdated rates system that relies heavily on retailing. Embracing digital: the potential that new forms of technology presents has been clear for some time. Articial intelligence, blockchain, software as a service , data analyticshave long been touted as potential game changers. There has been a marked pick-up over the last  months in firms making investments in these areas. Maturing of the technologies and a tighter labour market are factors in these trends and we expect that to continue in . Pockets of growth: regardless of the wider economic conditions, there will continue to be pockets of very fast growth throughout Northern Ireland. The pipeline of professional services inward investment remains strong, in particular with US firms seeking talent a noticeable trend. Media and film continues to boom and, even on the high street, there is no sign of a slowdown in the proleration of coffee shops, personal wellbeing businesses and take away outlets. Volatility: share prices and exchange rates are likely to be incredibly ‘spikey’ given the turbulence in the world economy. Summary – beating the forecasters The Northern Ireland economy’s labour market has surprised me over the past  months. I hope that it continues to outperform expectations in .  Hopefully, there will be a transition period in place with a clear roadmap to a future free trade agreement between the EU and UK which may prevent the scale of slow-down I worry may be coming. While on the subject of wish-casting, let us hope that the Executive is back and operating too in . If all these pieces fall into place then next year’s outlook for  will be much easier to write.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
