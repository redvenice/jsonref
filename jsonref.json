[{"url":null,"title":"Hero age MPs werent pygmies Biography Airey Neave","story":"    War hero Airey Neave, in a fake German uniform - the photo was taken after his capture at Colditz and remains on displayEven at the age of 63, and with a lifetime of bravery and adventure behind him, Airey Neave had much to look forward to. Handsome, charismatic and popular, Neave was one of our most distinguished and romantic figures – a decorated war hero, the first British officer to escape from Colditz, and a spymaster who went on to organise vital escape routes for air crews and prisoners of war from the terrors of Nazi-occupied Europe.Later, he became known not just as a Conservative MP but as the scheming consiglieri who used the dark arts of political management to mastermind Margaret Thatcher’s historic election as the first woman to lead the Conservative Party.Now, in the spring of 1979, and with a General Election looming, Neave – Thatcher’s Northern Ireland spokesman – was about to taste real political power for the first time.On Friday, March 30 at 9.30am, he left his Westminster flat for the Commons. With the weekend approaching, Neave had told his wife, Diana, that he would collect her in the afternoon so they could drive to their constituency home in Oxfordshire.Shortly before 3pm, his work completed, Neave headed to Parliament’s underground car park to collect his Vauxhall Cavalier. He turned the key in the ignition and drove up the ramp that led to the cobbles of New Palace Yard and the exit gate. At 2.58pm, the Palace of Westminster was shaken by a thunderous explosion. As the smoke cleared, the smouldering remnants of Neave’s Vauxhall could be seen immediately beneath the windows of Mrs Thatcher’s office.The Cavalier had been blown to smithereens by a car bomb – planted, it would later be confirmed, by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a faction of the IRA.Neave’s injuries were so severe that initially no one recognised him. It took almost half an hour to free him from the debris and load him into an ambulance bound for Westminster Hospital a mile away. He died eight minutes after arriving, just before Diana could reach him.When Margaret Thatcher gave her first tributes to her friend, grief and shock were still etched on her face.          Even at the age of 63, and with a lifetime of bravery and adventure behind him, Airey Neave had much to look forward to. Handsome, charismatic and popular, Neave was one of our most distinguished and romantic figures – a decorated war hero, the first British officer to escape from Colditz, and a spymaster who went on to organise vital escape routes for air crews and prisoners of war from the terrors of Nazi-occupied Europe‘He was one of freedom’s warriors,’ she said. ‘He was staunch, brave, true, strong. But very gentle and kind and loyal.’‘Some devils got him,’ she later added, with personal force. ‘And they must never, never, never be allowed to triumph.’As the Conservatives’ Northern Ireland spokesman, Neave had voiced trenchant views on Republican paramilitaries – he wanted the death sentence for convicted terrorists – and it now seems extraordinary that he didn’t have a police bodyguard. In fact, he had been pressed to accept protection, but he had rejected the offer. For, as Sir David McNee, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner said at the time: ‘He made it clear that if as an Englishman he could not walk the streets of London freely, life for him was truly not worth living.’Freedom and the impulse to escape are at the heart of Neave’s story and his extraordinary, Boy’s Own adventures.He had a conventional, if privileged, upbringing, the son of a noted naturalist, with two governors of the Bank of England among his forebears. Educated at Eton and Oxford, it was with the outbreak of the Second World War that his appetite for bravery and daring came to the fore.          Shortly before 3pm, his work completed, Neave headed to Parliament’s underground car park to collect his Vauxhall Cavalier. He turned the key in the ignition and drove up the ramp that led to the cobbles of New Palace Yard and the exit gate. At 2.58pm, the Palace of Westminster was shaken by a thunderous explosion. As the smoke cleared, the smouldering remnants of Neave’s Vauxhall could be seen immediately beneath the windows of Mrs Thatcher’s office. The Cavalier had been blown to smithereens by a car bomb – planted, it would later be confirmed, by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a faction of the IRAIn May 1940, Neave found himself in the Royal Artillery, fighting a desperate rearguard action as German Panzers advanced on the burning ruins of Calais. The odds were overwhelmingly stacked against him and Neave was lucky to survive when a bullet hit him on the left side, missing his heart by only half an inch. Captured by German troops because he was too weak to escape, he was taken into the heart of Nazi-controlled Europe and imprisoned.It was early the following year, when he was moved by train to Stalag XX-A near the Polish city of Thorn (modern-day Torun), that Neave showed his true colours again. Within weeks he had hatched a painstakingly thought-out escape plan. Stalag XX-A was like a small town, with outposts and suburbs and a labour force made up of prisoners who the Germans put to work. Central to the escape plot was a visit to the dentist’s wooden hut in the centre of the compound.The Germans allowed British officers to have their teeth examined every Thursday and it was Neave’s good fortune that he suffered from inflamed gums. His plan went swimmingly at first. After his session in the chair, Neave made way for Flying Officer Norman Forbes, a Hurricane pilot, and was allowed to go unescorted to the latrine next door.Inside, he retrieved some lengths of wood hidden in the ceiling by accomplices to be used as props. Neave was soon joined by Forbes and, at a signal from a sergeant who was keeping watch outside, they stepped out, carrying the timber, ostensibly just two ordinary soldiers engaged on some errand.They spent the next three days hidden by their fellow prisoners then, at 6am on the morning of April 19, after a cup of ersatz coffee, Neave and Forbes left the camp concealed amid a gang of 150 prisoners bound for a farm, where they were put to work in a barn. On a signal that the coast was clear, Neave and Forbes climbed into the loft and burrowed into the hay.

I went into the middle of the crowd and started drawing. I walked to Trafalgar Square with all these people in costume singing and chanting. \u0027It was also interesting because people weren\u0027t just holding placards made from cardboard. They were holding up iPads and phones that read \u0027F*** Trump\u0027.\u0027But Mr King said it was not just the big events of the year that are worth memorialising in pencil.

It was not until the 47th hour of their 48-hour hold on the pair that police say their investigation shifted and put Smollett in the frame.  On Monday, an interview Roberts had landed with the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department who tore through Smollett will air. Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson reserved no mercy for Smollett as he announced the police\u0027s case against him on Thursday morning. During an extraordinary press conference, he made reference to Smollett\u0027s tearful GMA appearance and condemned it, saying he could not watch the whole thing because it \u0027angered\u0027 him.           Their interview was the first time Smollett had answered questions about the case publicly \u0027To be quite honest, it\u0027s shameful. It painted this city that we all love and work hard in in a negative connotation.\u0027To insinuate an to stage a hate crime of that nature when he knew as a celebrity it would get a lot of attention, it\u0027s just despicable.   Jussie Smollett is shown in his mugshot on Thursday morning\u0027It makes you wonder what goes through someone\u0027s mind so yes, I did see part of the interview and I was angered by it,\u0027 he said. He also said that Smollett helped their investigation into him along by confirming to Roberts that the two men in the video - who they knew were Abel and Ola Osundairo - were the attackers.\u0027He identified who those two iniduals were. We knew that then but he didn\u0027t know that we knew.\u0027But yeah he helped us out when he identified them,\u0027 he said. During the interview, Smollett reacted to suspicion over his cooperation with the police investigation by insisting he was telling the truth. \u0027You do such a disservice when you lie about this kind of stuff,\u0027 he said.   Elsewhere he described himself \u0027fighting the f*** back\u0027 when he was jumped, screaming as he realized there was a noose around his neck and then calling the police with his 60-year-old friend Frank Gatson.He blamed the fact that he was being doubted on the political climate and said: \u0027The camera, facing north, how is that my issue? It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.\u0027 He also raised his voice when asked by Roberts about the fact people were suspicious he had gone out in subzero temperatures at 2am to get a salad from Subway.    Roberts will interview Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson on Monday. He eviscerated the actor on Thursday morning and mentioned the ABC interview in his remarks, describing it as \u0027shameful\u0027 that Smollett would go on television to allegedly lie \u0027Subway is open for 24 hours. People kill me when they say stuff like that because Subway is open 24 hours for a reason so that when you\u0027re hungry at night and you ain\u0027t got no food, you go to Subway!\u0027 he said.He said he was frustrated that Chicago Police had not yet found surveillance footage of the incident and revealed his disappointment after learning that a camera at the very spot of the attack was turned in the opposite direction when it took place. Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: \u0027There is a level of pride there.\u0027We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.\u0027  Smollett was bailed out of Cook County Jail on Thursday afternoon after posting $10,000 in bond money, ten percent of the total $100,000 that was set by a judge. His attorneys insist he is innocent and say he has been treated unfairly by the police and the prosecutor\u0027s office."},{"url":null,"title":"The true cost Meghans baby shower","story":"    At a tricky crossroads: Meghan in New York with Suits actress Abigail SpencerThe Duchess of Sussex was in New York this week, catching up with friends, having lunch and doing a little light shopping. It was a private visit so there was no additional cost to the British taxpayer.She is already back at work, flying the flag for Britain on a high-profile official visit to Morocco, where she and the Duke will promote diplomatic relations, boost UK interests and support humanitarian causes.Just another week in the everyday story of royal folk? Hardly. As Princess Diana’s private secretary, I learned to recognise that the line between official and private travel is never just about the money. It’s a code that opens a Pandora’s box of unintended consequences.Rich people’s jets — in this case a Gulfstream reportedly paid for by George and Amal Clooney — always come with a bill attached, even if it’s not the kind you can pay with a Duchy of Cornwall credit card.Favours must be returned, obligations quickly multiply and pretty soon royal free-riders are handing over their most precious assets: credibility and dignity, if not, please God, their lives.The uproar created in some quarters by Meghan’s brief, but undeniably extravagant, Big Apple excursion could hardly have been greater if she had run naked down Broadway and burned a Union Jack in Times Square.But let’s keep a sense of proportion here. A high-profile former actress, she happens to have rich celebrity friends and, if they behave as rich celebrities usually do, then good luck to her, surely.Anyway, other members of the Royal Family, notably Prince Charles and Camilla, have often been known graciously to accept favours from the mega-rich, especially if there’s a jet, a yacht or a private island on offer. Just don’t tactlessly mention the environmental damage.This whole subject is a high-hypocrisy zone, so instead, relax, enjoy the exotic pictures and remember the words of Jimmy Stewart’s character, the cynical hack Macaulay Connor in The Philadelphia Story: ‘The prettiest sight in this fine pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.’Royal dramas of this kind tend to fizzle out pretty quickly, fit only for tomorrow’s recycling bin.There will surely be some courtiers this morning (not least in Casablanca with the Duke and Duchess) who are trying this explanation on for size. Perhaps it will all blow over, they hope, and the British public’s love for its excitingly-disruptive American newcomer will resume undiminished.After all, it seems only yesterday that Her Royal Highness was winning hearts with her ‘bananagrams’ for sex workers in Bristol, recipe-sharing with women in the Grenfell community kitchen, and speech-making on women’s education and women’s suffrage on a hugely successful tour Down Under in October.

Five nights in a one-bedroom suite at The Mark Hotel costs $9,982.05Yet the excesses of the baby shower now threaten the benign indifference of the British public — an accident of history that is the Windsors’ most precious, but also most volatile, asset. Unfortunately for Meghan, in Windsor World it doesn’t require wicked intent to set the centuries-old edifice a-tremble: not knowing what you don’t know will do the job just as well.In this context, it’s hard to remember Meghan’s eager determination to ‘hit the ground running’ in her new royal career and not compare it with her sister-in-law Catherine’s less exciting but, in retrospect, wiser intention ‘to learn the ropes’.All Meghan’s running has brought her, at private-jet velocity, to a lonely crossroads. It’s a stark choice between the path of celebrity versus the path of duty, service and sacrifice.Did she recognise this dilemma before Prince Harry slipped that engagement ring onto her finger? As a gifted, intelligent and worldly woman, the answer is, surely, of course she did. She will also know that in marrying the Queen’s grandson, she has allied her interests with the Windsors’ instinct to protect their dynasty at any cost.          Duchess of Sussex visits  the Hubb Community Kitchen, LondonMeghan’s crossroads is as old as monarchy itself. A whole tribe of gutsy royal women have been here before her. In the last 100 years, several have been the spine and heart of the British Monarchy.These include: Alexandra, who endured Edward VII’s serial philandering and pioneered a new style of compassionate royal work Mary, who steeled her husband in World War I and Elizabeth the Queen Mother who did the same in WWII and the present Elizabeth, whose reign will likely never be surpassed as the standard for service before self.The common factor was a recognition that royal privilege and perks have to be paid for, not by rich chums, but by a lifetime of service to the people whose bows, curtsies and taxes will always be willingly given in return. Better make that probably willingly.Other women also passed this way. In the present reign, there has been a high failure rate of church weddings of first-rank Royal Family members. Only three, out of seven, have escaped the orce courts.One of those statistics was Harry’s mother, whose experience has hopefully also been carefully studied by Meghan. In comparing the two women, differences quickly outnumber any similarities. Diana’s 16-year royal career was already consigned to history before she reached the age Meghan is now.Meghan is no teen virgin, but a orced, media-smart and ambitious celebrity, empowered by all the arsenal of right-on feminism. Her fate is emphatically in her own hands, as it should be.Recent lurid headlines will fade, hurried on their way by the imminent arrival of what will surely be the most photogenic of babies.But that crossroads will, I predict, obstinately remain.Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to HRH The Princess of Wales 1988-96.

I just don’t think female stars with millions of young female fans should use nudity as a commercial tool. I don’t think that’s feminism, it’s exploitation.’‘No it’s NOT!’ she seethed. ‘A woman should be able to do whatever she wants, without limits and without some man always criticising her.’‘So, women can murder people?’‘Sorry, WHAT? No, of course not. Don’t be ridiculous.’‘So, there are limits then?’‘To committing murder, yes! But there’s nothing empowering about murder.’‘Those doing it might disagree, but you get my point. There are always limits, to everything. And now we’ve established there are limits to feminism, what did you think about Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajowski when they posted topless selfies of themselves flipping the bird? How is that remotely empowering?’‘It’s empowering because they are both free to do whatever they want with their bodies, and if they want to express themselves in that way, that is their choice and their right.’‘Sure, but isn’t it also my choice and right to criticise them for it?’‘Why should you?’          So now here she was, my pint-sized nemesis – standing just 5ft 3in tall, wearing a large sweatshirt and very small shorts, and with her striking brown eyes blazing defiantly at me.

It’s their life, their body. There’s such a double standard – male stars like Justin Bieber go topless all the time but nobody attacks him for it. I’m sure Kim and Emily did that picture because they were sick and tired of people criticising them all the time.’‘No,’ I interrupted, ‘they did it for commercial gain. Their careers are literally built on taking their clothes off and they’ve made millions doing it. They don’t have a world class talent like you.’I mentioned how I mock-tweeted about Kim Kardashian two nights ago when she appeared at a Hollywood beauty awards show in a tacky, cleavage-bulging bondage style black cut-out Thierry Mugler dress.Ariana thought for a few seconds.‘Let me say this: when you criticise women for what they wear like that, you don’t know what else they’ve been trying on to get to that point. You don’t know all the stress, and all the outfits, they’ve gone through trying to decide what will work and won’t work. It can be so nerve-wracking. You also don’t know how much they’ve been body shamed and what effect that has on any woman. It can make you feel horrible.’These were good points, but she needed a better example to illustrate them than the world’s most shameless clotheshorse.‘Kim Kardashian wears this outrageous stuff specifically so we all talk about it,’ I protested, ‘it’s literally her brand.’‘OK, but you were so wrong about Little Mix. I toured with those girls and I understood exactly what they were doing and saying. They were standing up for all girls who’ve been called those horrible names, and saying it doesn’t matter what people call you, you should feel proud of yourself and your body, and strong. I felt that when I saw their photo.’‘You did?’‘Yes. I used to be called all those horrible names myself, long before I was famous or even an adult. So with respect, I can relate to what young girls go through far better than you.’‘I accept that. But I have a 7-year-old daughter, I don’t want her thinking nudity is the route to success. That is my concern.’‘I understand that, I do,’ she said, but you should want your daughter to grow up believing she is free to do what she wants with her body and with her life.’‘I do, but whilst I believe you when you say YOU don’t use nudity or sex as a cynical commercial tool, and that for you it is a form of art attached to your performing, there are some other female stars who I am damn sure do.’‘I agree,’ she replied. ‘See, I AGREE. We’ve reached common ground again. Let’s get another drink to celebrate.’          Two large glasses of a very expensive Californian red appeared in seconds and we toasted each other by clinking them together. But she wasn’t happy when I looked away as I did itAriana turned to a waiter standing nearby.‘Can you get me and my new best friend Piers a glass of wine please?’ she asked him. ‘I’m paying.’Two large glasses of a very expensive Californian red appeared in seconds and we toasted each other by clinking them together.But she wasn’t happy when I looked away as I did it.‘NO!

OK, now we can drink.’‘Fiery little thing, aren’t you?’ I laughed.‘I’m Italian, half Sicilian, half Abruzzese. So I make no apologies for being passionate – it’s in my blood!’Victoria suddenly announced that she wanted to perform a trick with a toothpick and napkin, so we all stopped talking to watch.It was a simple, but well executed trick, and we applauded.‘This is fun,’ said Ariana. ‘I’m glad we bumped into each other.’‘Me too,’ I said, and I meant it. She’s a bright, lively, warm and entertaining young woman.But our F-word debate was far from over.‘I think radical feminism does immense damage to feminists,’ I suggested.‘What do you mean by radical feminism?’ she asked.I took out my phone and showed her a photo I had tweeted earlier in the day of a desecrated statue in Florida.Last Sunday, a former US sailor named George Mendonsa died.He was immortalised by Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous World War II photo on V-J Day in Times Square, which caught euphoric George sweeping dental nurse Greta Friedman – a stranger to him – into his arms and kissing her.They later became friends, and Greta said she had no issue with what George had done, understanding that he was showing spontaneous appreciation for all the work nurses did in the war.But on Monday, the day after George Mendonsa died, the statue depicting the moment was defaced with the words #MeToo in red paint.‘This is where radical feminism damages feminists,’ I said.‘I agree that doesn’t seem right,’ Ariana nodded. ‘There has to be some common sense and balance.’          Mac was the rapper Mac Miller, her boyfriend of two years who died of a drugs overdose last September, just a few months after they split up. Tears were flowing down her cheeks as I began to play the song, which is a beautiful, soulful cover version‘If women hate men, then everyone loses,’ I said.‘Yes, I agree. But women don’t hate men.’‘Some radical feminists definitely hate men.’‘OK, some may do. But most women don’t.’‘No, and most men want to treat women properly, fairly and equally.’‘OK, I accept that too.’We smiled.‘See, we’re really getting somewhere!’ she cried. ‘This is good. We’re finding common ground.’‘You know what else really p****d me off?’ I continued. ‘When “Baby It’s Cold Outside” was banned by some American radio stations for supposedly representing sexual assault. That’s bullsh*t.’Ariana’s eyes promptly welled up with tears.‘You OK?’ I asked.‘Yes, I’m sorry. That song is special to me.’Then she took my phone and hurriedly Googled something.‘There… Mac and I recorded a duet of it together. Not many people know about it. I love that song.’Mac was the rapper Mac Miller, her boyfriend of two years who died of a drugs overdose last September, just a few months after they split up.Tears were flowing down her cheeks as I began to play the song, which is a beautiful, soulful cover version.I suddenly felt incredibly sad for her.For a young woman, Ariana Grande’s had to endure some awful things in her life.‘You’ve been through a lot, haven’t you?’ I said.‘Yes. I don’t want to make out I’m been through any worse than anyone else. Everyone has their problems and their sh*t to deal with. But in recent years, I have…had a lot of pain and sadness.’The Manchester terror attack was an unimaginably dreadful and emotionally scarring experience.‘You know, I really admired your guts when you went back and put on that concert,’ I said. ‘I remember seeing you on stage, alone and tiny, and thinking how frightened you must have felt looking out at a huge stadium full of people and not knowing for sure there wasn’t some other lunatic out there waiting to do something terrible again.’‘I…..I……’ Ariana tried to speak, but tears flowed again. ‘I was scared, yes. But I had to do it.’‘I’ll be honest, I thought you were wrong to fly home after the attack.’‘I didn’t want to,’ she said, ‘I was told to, and it was all so chaotic and upsetting I just did what I was told. I wasn’t thinking straight.’‘I wrote a column attacking you for it.’‘You did? I never saw that.’‘Then you probably didn’t see my second column apologising to you when you flew back?’‘No!’I pulled out my phone again, found the column and urged her to read it.‘I don’t know if I want to, it all brings back such terrible memories for me.’But she did read it, slowly and carefully.The column ended with these words:‘Ariana, we’ve never met and I doubt I’ll be on your dinner party schedule any time soon. But I want you to know this: I seriously misjudged you. I had you down as just another self-obsessed millionaire pop star prepared to put her own safety before that of her fans. I was completely wrong. In fact, you’re an exceptional young woman who last night put on an exceptional show and in doing so, sent a massive two fingers to the disgusting creeps who thought they could bomb you and your fans into submission. That took huge personal courage, yes. But more than that, it took spirit. An indomitable spirit.The Blitz spirit. The kind that says: ‘I don’t care who you are, or how badly you want to hurt me or my way of life, or that of those I love, I’m not having it.’ My army brother says there are two types of people in life: those you’d want in the trenches next to you, and those you wouldn’t.

You’re one helluva gutsy young lady.’As Ariana finished reading this, she wept again.‘That was so kind, thank you.’‘I meant it,’ I replied. ‘I very rarely apologise to anyone for anything but I misjudged you, and I wanted to say so.’‘Well, I appreciate that. It seems I misjudged you, too.’John handed her a tissue.‘I’m so sorry for crying so much!’ she laughed. ‘I’m a very emotional person and these things really affect me.’‘It would be very strange if they didn’t,’ I said.‘Come meet my friends,’ Ariana commanded, so John and I walked over with her to her table and met her group.‘Good news!’ I announced, ‘Ariana’s decided to make her next record about me, it’s going to be called Thank u Piersy.’They looked at each other uneasily, then realised I was joking and laughed, with palpable relief.More wine arrived, and Ariana reprimanded me again for incorrect clinking technique. ‘LOOK INTO MY EYES!’‘Apologies.’I looked into her eyes and then proposed a toast to her and her team for their chart-busting triumph.‘You should all be very proud,’ I said, ‘this is an amazing achievement.’‘I couldn’t do any of this without these wonderful people,’ Ariana responded. ‘I have worked so hard to get to this point, so many shows, so many flights, so many hotels, so many media appearances, I’ve done whatever has needed to be done. I have no other life at the moment. But when you get a week like, you realise what you’ve been working for.’‘Has it been worth all the sacrifice?’‘Yes. It’s what I wanted. I love music. It’s my life. Music and my friends like these guys.’Then she turned to them: ‘I’ve been educating Piers about feminism.’They laughed, and I laughed.‘The most important thing you said tonight is that feminists have to bring men with them in their battle,’ I said. ‘Annie Lennox said the same thing to me, and I think it’s vital.’‘Yes,’ she replied, ‘but you men have to bring women with you too. It’s a two-way street. Remember Piers, this is about EQUALITY, in EVERYTHING… including PAY! We should be paid the same as men!’‘I totally agree,’ I said. ‘And men should be paid the same as women, right?’‘Right.’‘OK, so I’d like to be paid the exact same amount as you. What are you earning these days - $20 million a week?’There was a moment of silence before everyone exploded with laughter.‘You can’t sing!’ she insisted.‘I can sing!’ I retorted. ‘In fact, I regularly sing on TV to millions of people. So I demand equal pay as you.’‘That’s not how this works...’ she chuckled.‘Complicated, isn’t it?’ I countered.‘It doesn’t have to be.’Around 11.45pm, two hours of chat later, I stood up to leave.Ariana sprang up too, ran round the table and exclaimed: ‘Can we hug? Would that be inappropriate?’‘Yes, of course,’ I replied.So we hugged.‘I’m so glad we met,’ she said.‘Me too,’ I replied.‘I think we’re going to be good friends,’ she said, ‘we’re a lot more alike than I realised.’Ariana Grande is an extraordinarily charismatic and talented young lady, right at the top of her professional game.I enjoyed her company enormously, and appreciated her desire – particularly in these highly partisan BrexitTrump times - to engage so enthusiastically in respectful debate with someone she had previously locked horns with on Twitter.John and I left, and as we walked back into the chilly Beverly Hills night air, we both burst out laughing.‘Did that just happen?’ he asked.‘It did,’ I said. ‘Only in Hollywood, right?’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Jewish Labour MP defect Corbyns party","story":"    Dame Louise Ellman was barracked by supporters of the Labour leader during a bruising meeting of her Liverpool Riverside constituency party A Jewish Labour MP who was subjected to a ‘Soviet show trial’ by party members was last night at the centre of claims that she will be the next MP to defect from Jeremy Corbyn’s party.Just hours after Mr Corbyn claimed that there was no ‘widespread’ problem of anti-Semitism in the Party, Dame Louise Ellman was barracked by supporters of the Labour leader during a bruising meeting of her Liverpool Riverside constituency party on Friday evening. The hard-Left activists overwhelmingly passed a motion supporting the activists who targeted fellow Liverpool MP Luciana Berger, leading a friend of Dame Louise to say: ‘Louise will not be in the party for much longer.’Ms Berger, who is also Jewish and required a bodyguard at last year’s Labour Party Conference after receiving death threats, quit Labour on Monday saying the party was ‘institutionally anti-Semitic’ – a day after The Mail on Sunday revealed that she was on the brink of forming a breakaway movement in protest at Mr Corbyn’s failure to tackle the problem. She was one of the seven Labour MP founders of The Independent Group.  This newspaper reported last year that Mr Corbyn and others on his staff had been heard describing Dame Louise as ‘the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv’, a claim which the Corbyn camp denied.Queen to enjoy a rare \u0027secret\u0027 dinner with the US Ambassador...\u0027Walking away from our movement achieves nothing\u0027: Jeremy...Share this articleDuring raucous scenes in Friday’s meeting a motion was passed expressing ‘complete solidarity’ with the executive of Ms Berger’s Wavertree party and depicting the allegations that she was forced out of the party by bullying local activists as a ‘smear’.Former Liverpool Mayor Malcolm Kennedy said he believed Dame Louise was being subjected to a ‘bullying’ campaign. ‘It’s the atmosphere, it’s the attitudes,’ he said.          A fresh row erupted over claims Labour had failed to discipline an activist who suggested that Dame Louise and fellow Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth (pictured above) did not have ‘human blood’Dame Louise has been repeatedly attacked by Left-wing activists since speaking out on the anti-Semitism scandal, who have seized on her support for the Labour Friends of Israel group, of which she is vice-chairwoman.Her friends said that she was ‘agonising’ over her future in the party which she joined over 55 years ago. One said: ‘She doesn’t like the idea of joining other groups but she is re-ally struggling with how the party’s handled the anti-Semitism row.’          Last Friday, Mr Corbyn – when asked about claims of bullying in Labour – told Sky News: ‘I don’t believe it exists on a wide scale.’Speaking in Tory defector Anna Soubry’s Broxtowe seat – a key Labour target at the next Election – he accused the ‘mainstream media’ of being ‘unkeen on relating to day-to-day issues that people faced in their lives’. He said that in a Sky News interview on Friday he had had to intervene to ask: ‘Is there any chance that anybody other than an MP could be referred to in any of your questions and we could actually talk about the homeless, the poverty, the hospital waiting lists?’In the interview, Mr Corbyn claimed the media ‘only ever talk about Westminster gossip’.But last night, Dudley North MP Ian Austin, one of the nine Labour MPs who walked out of the party last week, accused Mr Corbyn of failing to appreciate the scale of the crisis.He said: ‘Labour will never be in a position to do anything about homelessness and poverty unless it faces up to the nature of his leadership and this really unpleasant culture of intolerance and extremism. Jeremy Corbyn still doesn’t get it.’                        A fresh row erupted over claims Labour had failed to discipline an activist who suggested that Dame Louise and fellow Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth did not have ‘human blood’ – five months after the party’s deputy leader Tom Watson filed a complaint.Mr Corbyn was challenged last week to explain why the party had apparently not suspended Arjum Wajid for ‘outrageous’ attacks on them last summer.Ms Wajid tweeted: ‘Don’t know what runs through their veins, not human blood. Their hearts and brains totally devoid of humanity and eyes blind to truth.’Separately at a private meeting in Westminster last week, Mrs Smeeth told Mr Corbyn: ‘I think you would be happy if I left the party.’When he apparently failed to reply, sources say party general secretary Jennie Formby interjected to tell the MP: ‘I want you to stay.’Mrs Smeeth then issued a vow to remain in the party, saying: ‘I am staying. If I am the last Jew in the Labour Party, I’m staying. I’m not going.’In 2016, Mrs Smeeth left Mr Corbyn’s launch of an anti-Semitism report in tears after being taunted by a Corbynista.Ms Berger’s departure has put pressure on other Jewish MPs in the party – including Dame Louise, Mrs Smeeth, Dame Margaret Hodge and Alex Sobel – to follow suit.Ian Austin, an adopted son of a Jewish refugee, announced he was leaving the party on Friday, but said he would not be joining The Independent Group. Former leader Ed Miliband, who is Jewish, has said he has no intention of quitting the party.Last Friday, Mr Corbyn – when asked about claims of bullying in Labour – told Sky News: ‘I don’t believe it exists on a wide scale.’ Last night, when asked about the decision of her local party to express solidarity with the Wavertree Constituency Labour Party executive, Dame Louise said: ‘This is shameful.’ She refused to confirm that she would quit the party.Party sources said they could not comment on inidual cases but insisted Ms Wajid was still being taken through party disciplinary procedures. A spokesman said: ‘The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.‘All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Hero age MPs werent pygmies Biography Airey Neave","story":"    War hero Airey Neave, in a fake German uniform - the photo was taken after his capture at Colditz and remains on displayEven at the age of 63, and with a lifetime of bravery and adventure behind him, Airey Neave had much to look forward to. Handsome, charismatic and popular, Neave was one of our most distinguished and romantic figures – a decorated war hero, the first British officer to escape from Colditz, and a spymaster who went on to organise vital escape routes for air crews and prisoners of war from the terrors of Nazi-occupied Europe.Later, he became known not just as a Conservative MP but as the scheming consiglieri who used the dark arts of political management to mastermind Margaret Thatcher’s historic election as the first woman to lead the Conservative Party.Now, in the spring of 1979, and with a General Election looming, Neave – Thatcher’s Northern Ireland spokesman – was about to taste real political power for the first time.On Friday, March 30 at 9.30am, he left his Westminster flat for the Commons. With the weekend approaching, Neave had told his wife, Diana, that he would collect her in the afternoon so they could drive to their constituency home in Oxfordshire.Shortly before 3pm, his work completed, Neave headed to Parliament’s underground car park to collect his Vauxhall Cavalier. He turned the key in the ignition and drove up the ramp that led to the cobbles of New Palace Yard and the exit gate. At 2.58pm, the Palace of Westminster was shaken by a thunderous explosion. As the smoke cleared, the smouldering remnants of Neave’s Vauxhall could be seen immediately beneath the windows of Mrs Thatcher’s office.The Cavalier had been blown to smithereens by a car bomb – planted, it would later be confirmed, by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a faction of the IRA.Neave’s injuries were so severe that initially no one recognised him. It took almost half an hour to free him from the debris and load him into an ambulance bound for Westminster Hospital a mile away. He died eight minutes after arriving, just before Diana could reach him.When Margaret Thatcher gave her first tributes to her friend, grief and shock were still etched on her face.          Even at the age of 63, and with a lifetime of bravery and adventure behind him, Airey Neave had much to look forward to. Handsome, charismatic and popular, Neave was one of our most distinguished and romantic figures – a decorated war hero, the first British officer to escape from Colditz, and a spymaster who went on to organise vital escape routes for air crews and prisoners of war from the terrors of Nazi-occupied Europe‘He was one of freedom’s warriors,’ she said. ‘He was staunch, brave, true, strong. But very gentle and kind and loyal.’‘Some devils got him,’ she later added, with personal force. ‘And they must never, never, never be allowed to triumph.’As the Conservatives’ Northern Ireland spokesman, Neave had voiced trenchant views on Republican paramilitaries – he wanted the death sentence for convicted terrorists – and it now seems extraordinary that he didn’t have a police bodyguard. In fact, he had been pressed to accept protection, but he had rejected the offer. For, as Sir David McNee, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner said at the time: ‘He made it clear that if as an Englishman he could not walk the streets of London freely, life for him was truly not worth living.’Freedom and the impulse to escape are at the heart of Neave’s story and his extraordinary, Boy’s Own adventures.He had a conventional, if privileged, upbringing, the son of a noted naturalist, with two governors of the Bank of England among his forebears. Educated at Eton and Oxford, it was with the outbreak of the Second World War that his appetite for bravery and daring came to the fore.          Shortly before 3pm, his work completed, Neave headed to Parliament’s underground car park to collect his Vauxhall Cavalier. He turned the key in the ignition and drove up the ramp that led to the cobbles of New Palace Yard and the exit gate. At 2.58pm, the Palace of Westminster was shaken by a thunderous explosion. As the smoke cleared, the smouldering remnants of Neave’s Vauxhall could be seen immediately beneath the windows of Mrs Thatcher’s office. The Cavalier had been blown to smithereens by a car bomb – planted, it would later be confirmed, by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a faction of the IRAIn May 1940, Neave found himself in the Royal Artillery, fighting a desperate rearguard action as German Panzers advanced on the burning ruins of Calais. The odds were overwhelmingly stacked against him and Neave was lucky to survive when a bullet hit him on the left side, missing his heart by only half an inch. Captured by German troops because he was too weak to escape, he was taken into the heart of Nazi-controlled Europe and imprisoned.It was early the following year, when he was moved by train to Stalag XX-A near the Polish city of Thorn (modern-day Torun), that Neave showed his true colours again. Within weeks he had hatched a painstakingly thought-out escape plan. Stalag XX-A was like a small town, with outposts and suburbs and a labour force made up of prisoners who the Germans put to work. Central to the escape plot was a visit to the dentist’s wooden hut in the centre of the compound.The Germans allowed British officers to have their teeth examined every Thursday and it was Neave’s good fortune that he suffered from inflamed gums. His plan went swimmingly at first. After his session in the chair, Neave made way for Flying Officer Norman Forbes, a Hurricane pilot, and was allowed to go unescorted to the latrine next door.Inside, he retrieved some lengths of wood hidden in the ceiling by accomplices to be used as props. Neave was soon joined by Forbes and, at a signal from a sergeant who was keeping watch outside, they stepped out, carrying the timber, ostensibly just two ordinary soldiers engaged on some errand.They spent the next three days hidden by their fellow prisoners then, at 6am on the morning of April 19, after a cup of ersatz coffee, Neave and Forbes left the camp concealed amid a gang of 150 prisoners bound for a farm, where they were put to work in a barn. On a signal that the coast was clear, Neave and Forbes climbed into the loft and burrowed into the hay.

The source said: ‘It was absolutely chilling.

Several women at Henderson Rowe had complained about sexist comments from Mr Aram (pictured) In a separate incident last year, an Arab employee with a Jewish wife had offensive messages written in a birthday card, including a picture of the IS flag, a drawing of a man having sex with a camel and a sketch of the star of David on a penis. Mr Rowe signed the card with an insult.Mr Aram’s use of the n-word came in a conversation with a group of junior male colleagues following a ‘cultural realignment session’ organised by RGA last year.

Henderson Rowe denied this, saying last year a ‘third-party investigation’ was launched into the firm’s trading practices going back six years and ‘no evidence of systematic churning’ was found.Mike Bowers, RGA’s chief operating officer, said: ‘We acknowledge Henderson Rowe has in the past tolerated language and jokes that are inconsistent with Rayliant’s values.

It’s not just concerning – it’s appalling, especially over the issue of anti-Semitism.’Our investigation also shows that Milne has parroted Kremlin propaganda, defending Russian aggression against its neighbours, from its invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 to Vladimir Putin’s ongoing campaign against Ukraine. Our findings prompted the former head of MI6 to warn last night that if Corbyn were to win a General Election, he would have to cut off contact with Milne because of the risk Milne poses to national security.Sir Richard Dearlove, who led the Secret Intelligence Service between 1999 and 2004, said Milne stood ‘no chance’ of passing Whitehall’s system of background checks, known as developed vetting, and so could not be allowed to see classified documents.The Mail on Sunday can reveal:During a university vacation in 1977, Milne visited Lebanon during its civil war, and met Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) terrorists dedicated to destroying Israel by violence Returning to England, he set up and ran a campaign to spread PLO propaganda at Oxford UniversityLater, Milne forged links with Hamas, which remains committed to Israel’s destruction and has perpetrated hundreds of terrorist attacks – and travelled with Corbyn to meet its leaders on a trip to the Middle East funded by UK Hamas sympathisers in 2010After graduating in 1979, he became the business manager for a hardline, pro-Soviet newspaper that backed PLO violence, Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution in Iran, the taking of American hostages and the Russian invasion of AfghanistanThe paper’s star columnist was a long-standing Kremlin moleMilne personally backed the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the trigger for decades of terrorist violence, arguing that it was a ‘progressive’ event that was ‘liberating’ Afghan women and improving human rightsAs a reporter for The Guardian newspaper in the 1980s, Milne acquired a powerful mentor – features editor Richard Gott, who was later forced to resign after admitting that he took a series of foreign trips paid for by the Soviets, during which he met KGB officialsAfter the 1984 Provisional IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference – which killed five people and injured 31 – Milne told Guardian colleagues ‘I think it is a very daring attack’, as maimed victims were still being carried from the wreckageIn 2014 he chaired a conference session in Russia at which the star speaker was Vladimir Putin, with all his expenses paid for by its organisers, a think-tank close to Putin’s government. Afterwards, he was criticised by his colleagues at The Guardian, which had boycotted the event because it took place just months after Russia illegally seized Crimea from Ukraine.Last summer, when the depth of Labour’s anti-Semitism crisis first became apparent, Jeremy Corbyn tried to stop Labour adopting the full and unmodified International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.The IHRA says it is anti-Semitic to claim the State of Israel is an inherently ‘racist endeavour’ which has no right to exist. Milne has supported groups that make this anti-Semitic claim and advocate violence to achieve their goals since he was a teenager. Moderate Labour MPs say Milne’s beliefs have an ‘undue influence’ on Labour policy and its mishandling of the anti-Semitism crisis that has engulfed the party.

But he has absolute, complete influence over Corbyn. I don’t think Jeremy makes a decision about anything without Seumas Milne signing off on it.’A senior party staff member said: ‘Without a shadow of a doubt, Corbyn trusts Milne more than anyone. I actually think Corbyn is a little bit thick. It’s no exaggeration to say that Milne is Corbyn’s brain.’He added that this was why Corbyn resisted the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism until he was finally overruled by his National Executive: ‘Seumas has been supporting groups that deny Israel’s right to exist for many years.’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghans caterer gushes Marie Antoinette approved Duchesss baby shower banquet","story":"    The Duchess of Sussex is unlikely to welcome comparisons to the 18th Century French queenExquisitely hand-crafted from an original French recipe dating back to 1862, they were the crowning feature on a table of sweet treats fit for a queen – or at the very least a heavily-pregnant duchess.Four French macaron ‘towers’ from the famous Parisian bakery Ladurée last week became the highlight of the spectacular baby shower feast enjoyed by Meghan Markle and her A-list friends in New York.While the five-day, £350,000 extravaganza – culminating in a party inside America’s most expensive hotel suite at The Mark in Manhattan – made headlines around the world, The Mail on Sunday can today reveal just how opulent Wednesday’s celebratory banquet really was.It was so lavish, in fact, that Ladurée’s website boasts of how its signature macaron towers ‘evoke the Parisian glamour and elegance that Marie Antoinette would approve of’.The Duchess of Sussex is unlikely to welcome comparisons to the 18th Century French queen who, when told that her subjects were starving and had no bread, replied: ‘Let them eat cake.’But the scale and grandeur of the table which greeted famously sweet-toothed Meghan and up to 20 guests was staggering. Central were the four macaron towers, costing a total of £350 and infused with the delicate flavours of rose petals, passion fruit, vanilla and pistachio.Made from organic almond flour, eggs and sugar, each delicate macaron is handmade using two outer shells with a piped ganache filling. Thousands of yellow vest protesters take to the streets...The look that hooked Meghan’s dad: The charming high school...Share this articleThey contain an average of 80 calories each and are gluten-free – and should not be confused with a a traditional British macaroon made with coconut and almonds.The four custom-made pyramid cakes – two medium-sized and two small – were from Ladurée’s store on New York’s exclusive Madison Avenue, an order which requires two-days’ notice.

The picture showed a gold-rimmed plate with a pale green baby rattle pop cake, a cupcake with a stencilled pram decoration and a biscuit in the shape of a stork carrying a baby.But The Mail on Sunday can today reveal that Meghan, radiant in a white-spotted navy blue maternity dress, had far more than designer biscuits to choose from.The groaning table, covered in a thick cream linen tablecloth, was anchored by a spectacular centrepiece of a huge glass vase containing 3ft high cherry blossom branches. Scattered arrangements of Meghan’s favourite pink peonies and delicate sweet peas completed the elegant look.In addition to the macaron towers, there was more drama in the cakes and confectionery thought to have been made by Michelin-starred chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose eponymous restaurant at The Mark is considered one of the finest in New York. Meghan, 37, who is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant, is a self-confessed foodie and while guests including her former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer, Ms Mulroney, hairdresser Serge Normant and designer Misha Nonoo were serenaded by harpist Erin Hill, the food was the real star. Custom-made cakes including Key lime tarts, cherry tarts, red velvet cakes and carrot cakes, sat beside gold-embellished containers filled with sugar crystals into which stork-shaped biscuits had been artfully arranged.Health-conscious Meghan insisted on items being marked ‘gluten free’ for those with dietary constraints.There were also cotton candy pom poms (candy floss on sticks) – explaining the delivery of a candy floss machine to the hotel during a snow storm on the eve of the party – and a jar of multi-coloured ‘donut holes’ that were gluten-free and just 40 calories each. Sources said Ms Williams’ designer biscuits, including iced storks on lollipop sticks, trays of sweet bunnies with chocolate piping and biscuits in the shape of traditional English prams in blue icing, were a hit.The colour scheme featured multiple hues of blues, pinks, yellows and greens and gave no hint as to the gender of the future Baby Sussex. ‘It was a delicious palate of colours and a very sophisticated table,’ a source said.‘There was no dominant colour theme. It was just opulent, luxurious and completely over the top.’ Cupcakes topped with yellow and orange piped flowers (130 calories each) sat beside mini lemon meringue pies (325 calories) and pink meringues (100 calories).    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are welcomed by officials on their arrival at Casablanca airport, for their tour of MoroccoThe four macaron towers sat on white royal icing bases and the banquet featured a spectacular white ‘pop cake’ pyramid decorated with hand-crafted pink paper flowers that, according to one observer, ‘looked almost too good to eat’.Drinks ranged from vintage champagne to designer teas and £12 bottles of water.The official baby shower cake was a two-tier white fondant confection decorated with paper figures of Meghan, Harry and a pram positioned in front of cut-out paper cherry blossom trees.     The official baby shower cake was a two-tier white fondant confection decorated with paper figures of Meghan, Harry and a pram positioned in front of cut-out paper cherry blossom treesWhile the cost of the five-day celebration, including Meghan’s one-bedroom, £15,312-a-night suite and her ride in George Clooney’s private jet was estimated at £350,000, the food alone may have cost up to £20,000.  Meghan, 37, is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant One Los Angeles-based private chef who works for A-list celebrities said: ‘If you look at the ingredients alone, then you’d probably be looking at two to three grand, but when you factor in The Mark hotel and Jean-Georges, then the sky is the limit. If I was to put a figure on an event like this, in a location like that, I’d say ten to 20 grand.’There have been suggestions that the New York bash was used by Meghan to wrest back control of her own image. It certainly drew huge media attention with scores of photographers camped behind barriers outside the hotel.The duchess arrived in New York on February 15. The following day she had dinner with Ms Williams, Ms Mulroney and close friend Markus Anderson.Guests arrived at the baby shower with gifts including a £326 Babyletto crib and a £470 Trek bicycle. Flowers were provided by a company called Lady Fleur and Meghan later donated the arrangements to charities. However, the fate of any left-over food is unknown. The LA chef said: ‘It’s doubtful that number of guests could possibly have consumed that amount of food.‘It would be nice to think that someone somewhere might be enjoying a rose-petal flavoured French macaron.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Shamima Begums father says governments side","story":"    Ahmed Ali, the father of Shamima Begum, outside his house in the village of Dairai, Sunam Gonj district, in the greater Sylhet region of Bangladesh. Mr Ali has said he backs Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s decision to strip his daughter of her British citizenshipHe last saw his youngest daughter on a visit to the UK two months before she fled to Syria with schoolfriends Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase in March 2015.Mr Ali said he had been shocked by her lack of remorse about joining IS during a series of media interviews at a Syrian refugee camp last week.Begum, who gave birth to a son, Jarrah, last Sunday, pleaded to be allowed back to the UK but caused outrage by failing to apologise for joining the terror group and arguing that the 2017 bombing of the Manchester Arena by an Islamic extremist was justified.‘If she at least admitted she made a mistake then I would feel sorry for her and other people would feel sorry for her. But she does not accept her wrong,’ Mr Ali said.He insisted she had shown no sign of being radicalised.‘I never saw anything of concern in her at the time,’ he added. ‘She was as usual, normal. She never used to pray regularly, she was not that Islamic-minded.’\u0027British women are hiding among us\u0027: ISIS women in refugee...Pregnant at just 10, girl is trapped as sex slave in ISIS...Share this articleMr Javid sparked controversy last week by stripping Begum, 19, of her British nationality on the grounds that she is eligible for citizenship of Bangladesh through her mother.Begum’s relatives in Britain have warned the Home Secretary that they will challenge his decision in the courts and The Mail on Sunday has unearthed a case with striking similarities that may provide them with hope.    Shabina Aslam, 29, and Alireza Sabar, 17, from Didsbury, Manchester, say they miss their independenceThe case involved another jihadi bride, identified only as ‘G3’, who fled to Syria to join IS with her two children, then aged one and two, in November 2016. She was arrested in Turkey as she tried to return to the UK.As with Begum, the Home Office stripped the woman – of Bangladeshi heritage but born in Enfield, North London – of her British citizenship. However, her family won an appeal.Last night an official for Kurdish forces holding the jihadi prisoners at Al-Hole insisted Begum should be repatriated, saying: ‘It is not just Britain but all the countries – we want them to take their prisoners.’  So Mr Javid, what will you do with all of these women once they decide to return?   These are some of the 150 British women who joined Islamic State in Syria and are thought to still be in the region   Shamima Begum is one of more than 150 British women and girls who fled to Syria to join the barbaric Islamic State terror group.The Mail on Sunday has identified 26 women who are still at large, and a further four who have returned home. Jihadi brides are more likely to come back to the UK than their husbands, many of whom died fighting.As IS loses its last stronghold in Baghouz, there have been reports of an exodus of British jihadi brides and their children to Kurdish refugee camps in the north of Syria.The Kurdish authorities have said as many as 12 British jihadi brides are living in Al-Hol, the camp where Begum was found.Home Secretary Sajid Javid has stripped Begum of her British citizenship. Attempts to do the same to other jihadi brides is likely to result in dozens of battles in the High Court over the next few years. "},{"url":null,"title":"Go Pressure mounts Labour MP gives Corbyn shape ship ultimatum","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn faced an open ‘shape up or ship out’ challenge from one of his own MPs over the mounting anti-Semitism and Brexit rows engulfing LabourBermondsey MP Mr Coyle tore into the leader over his handling of anti-Semitism allegations and the lack of clarity on Labour’s policy on Brexit.According to sources, Mr Coyle demanded to know why the party’s conference resolution to be ready to press for a second referendum was not being honoured by the leadership. \u0027Walking away from our movement achieves nothing\u0027: Jeremy...Jeremy Corbyn calls on Tony Blair\u0027s old flatmate Lord...Share this articleHe said: ‘Jeremy, if you’re not prepared to deliver on tackling anti-Semitism, implementing the party’s policy on Europe and involving members far more drawing up policy, I’m afraid you should go and let someone else come in – someone who can both deliver on what you promised and prepare our party for an Election.’Sources say Mr Corbyn was taken aback by the MP’s challenge but failed to offer any direct response.

It was obvious why: her own daughter had died suddenly at the age of six. But this time was different.First, the cortege with its near-weightless casket came across a dead man lying in its path, exposed flesh picked away by vultures. Then, in the cemetery, the sky filled with the birds that had been feasting on the corpse.“I felt as if death had appeared and said, ‘That’s enough! Don’t keep living your suffering in this way. Stop it!’” says Iturbide, on the phone from her home in Mexico City.The contact sheets from that day provide a frame-by-frame account of how a chance encounter transformed Iturbide’s early compulsion to photograph infant mortality into a longer-lasting fascination with birds. They also illustrate how her work constantly throws up new ways of seeing key themes such as pain, dignity and mystery, and how those themes never go away.“The camera for me is a pretext for exploring life and culture around the world, and what usually guides me is what surprises me as I look at things,” she says. “If I am not surprised, I cannot take photographs, because it is missing that emotional dimension.”Graciela Iturbide’s Mexico, a new book that accompanies an exhibition of the same name currently at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, explores those surprises in her native country and includes her best-known work from the extended periods she spent in indigenous communities 40-odd years ago.There is the celebrated image of a regal Zapotec woman with iguanas on her head taken in the southern city of Juchitán, where women famously wield unusual amounts of power, as well as many other photographs featuring faces and bodies that show the strain of hard lives on the margins.And yet Iturbide, who describes herself as “very politicised” and “of the left”, insists poverty and injustice are never her point. “Whether in my country or in other places, I notice the pain as well as the beauty, but I never shoot poverty,” she insists. “I am interested in taking pictures of people with dignity.”Iturbide is similarly keen to protect her more recent pictures of Frida Kahlo’s corset, prosthetic leg and other intimate possessions set against the stark background of her bathroom from being sucked up in the mythification of the artist as a feminist icon. “I am not a Fridamaniac,” she says. “What I photographed was Frida’s pain.”Iturbide draws a quiet satisfaction from the contrast of her images on display in Boston with the anti-Mexican rhetoric coming out of the Trump White House, just as she celebrates the success in Hollywood of the film Roma, directed by her friend Alfonso Cuarón. But she insists there is no political takeaway from her photographs.“My work is egocentric. It is about what Graciela Iturbide saw when she was taking photographs around the world, nothing more,” she says. “I am showing how I interpret things through all the influences in my life.”These include her unshakable fascination with what she calls the “paraphernalia of religion” and ritual, which she maintains despite being an atheist. She says its roots in her childhood as the eldest of 13 children in a strict, religious and well-to-do Mexico City family are just too deep, though long since transformed by her creative independence.The foundations for that freedom lay in her break for liberty at 19 when she married a “relatively liberal man”. Then, after having three children in quick succession, she went to film school and took a class with renowned photographer Manuel Álvarez Bravo.“Álvarez Bravo taught me another way to live,” she says, downplaying what her mentor taught her about photographic technique.Now, at the age of 76, Iturbide, who has been described as “one of the most important and influential Latin American photographers of the past four decades, who continues to inspire a younger generation of photographers”, is spending time revisiting old projects, particularly outside Mexico.These include returning to photograph a group of deaf people within an east LA street gang she first captured on film in her contribution to a 1987 book called A Day in the Life of America. She is currently planning a trip to take pictures of them visiting the grave of a recently deceased female leader.“I like to maintain a relationship with people I have worked with,” she says. “The experience with them has been very lovely.”The ever-present importance of time and ritual in Iturbide’s work is also there in her unflinching loyalty to shooting with film. For one thing, she knows that the mysterious surprises she seeks in the field can also lurk on a contact sheet.That’s what happened with the famed image of a Seri indigenous woman heading down a mountain with the Sonoran desert in northern Mexico stretching out below her.“It’s my favourite photograph, because I don’t remember taking it,” she says with a laugh. “Maybe it was some kind of spirit out there that took it.”Graciela Iturbide’s Mexico is published by MFA Publications (£38.32$49.95)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda3ddb7e922bf2cf1c5f7ee76e55479d24245e8/0_0_1890_1299/master/1890.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9186300bc878ebfc14b3025a63f755fc 700w","title":"images behind the weeks news","story":"Islamic State fighters surrender in Syria, a firefall at Yosemite national park, Central American migrants in Mexico and Karl Lagerfeld’s final collection for Fendi at Milan fashion week – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ddde74f1a6705e982e9e0439e056bfc45b9f518/50_134_4716_2829/master/4716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=156df9ec42b25d3eb9155015ad254fd8","title":"global economy slowing down what can governments do","story":"Central banks are getting twitchy. On average, recessions have come along once a decade since the mid-1970s and the nadir of the last downturn occurred almost a decade ago.The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has predicted that there will be a recession in America by the time Donald Trump comes up for re-election at the end of next year.The darkening outlook for global growth is putting pressure on the US president to resolve his trade dispute with China. When the White House announced its first tranche of protectionist measures almost a year ago, hopes were high that the world economy had at last shrugged off the long hangover from the financial crisis and deep slump of 2008-09. In the months before Trump went toe-to-toe with China’s president, Xi Jinping, it was expanding strongly and the International Monetary Fund was talking about a synchronised upturn. A year later – and with the 1 March deadline for a fresh round of US tariffs fast approaching – the mood has changed. All of which raises three big questions:Official statistics in the US have been delayed as a result of the federal government shutdown, but when the figures for growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 are finally released this week, they are expected to show that the world’s biggest economy has joined in a slowdown that is affecting Europe, China and a slew of other strategically important countries.Spending by American consumers in December was weak, but perhaps of more significance was the sharp pull-back in manufacturing in January, which fits with a picture of declining factory output elsewhere. In the winter of 2008, crashing industrial production and a contraction in trade flows were signs of the depth of the global slump. Ominously, both are again weak.For countries heavily dependent on exports as a source of growth – China, Germany, Japan and South Korea – falling demand for their goods is bad news.Globalisation has increased the tendency of one economy to be synchronised with all the others: there was a generalised upswing in the 1990s when China was a destination for western foreign investment, a growing market for exporters of commodities and industrial machinery, and the source of cheap goods that kept inflation and interest rates low.China has been a key export market for Germany, which has only barely escaped falling into a technical recession – defined as two successive quarters of negative growth. The latest snapshot of manufacturing in Japan pointed to a contraction in factory output.Announcing the International Monetary Fund’s latest forecasts for the world economy in Davos last month, the fund’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said that while a recession was “not around the corner”, the risks of a sharper decline in activity had increased. Policymakers should make greater efforts, Lagarde added, to prepare for a slowdown.Trump’s tweets were deemed to be the work of a bully, and in its determination to defend its independence the Fed ignored the fact that, on this issue, the president might have had a point.When its policymakers met again in January, there was an almost complete U-turn. No longer would the Fed be making three quarter-point rate rises this year. It would also do more to keep intact the stimulus programme it adopted in the wake of the banking crash – a process known as quantitative easing (QE), which the Fed has reduced from $4.5tn to $4tn over the past couple of years.“They will have a permanently gigantic balance sheet,” said Ward McCarthy, chief US financial economist at investment bank Jefferies. “They always said it would be larger than pre-crisis, but earlier commentary suggested it would be significantly smaller.”Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), is staring at the same data as the Fed. His message to the world has been: as someone who was less bullish in the good times, I have less reason to be panicked today.At his January press conference, he said the ECB was not yet ready to reverse its policy, set out in December, of stabilising its stimulus package. He said its stock of loans would stay at €2.6tn. Yes, he was gloomier about prospects for the eurozone economy, but no, he wasn’t ready to change course yet.In Rome, the coalition government comprising the far-right League and radical M5S wanted him to loosen the purse strings and keep pumping out cheap money, while the German government wanted the ECB to follow the Fed’s previous policy. Draghi looked calm taking the middle road.In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan has remained immune to all talk of normalising monetary policy, 10 years after the banking crash. It has continued to expand its lending and in the past week hinted that it might even accelerate the policy to prevent Japan falling into recession.China, meanwhile, has taken a series of steps to boost spending and lending in an effort to counter the forces bringing about a dramatic slowing of consumer spending and business investment.Central banks and finance ministries had better hope that the action taken so far will be enough to avert a recession because they will soon run out of conventional policy options.In 2008-09, the response to the financial crisis was fivefold: the central banks cut interest rates aggressively they pumped cheap money into their economies through QE finance ministries bailed out the banks with taxpayers’ money governments ran bigger budget deficits as a way of boosting growth and international cooperation kept trade flowing.But today interest rates are still either zero or just about zero in most of the developed world QE has been subject to the law of diminishing returns and has proved politically controversial the public appetite for another round of bank bailouts is nonexistent government debt levels are much higher than they were a decade ago and economic nationalism is on the rise.“I think we’re in much worse shape. We probably don’t have a crisis of that magnitude about to hit us – God help us if we do – but we’re in much worse shape to deal with whatever shocks come along than we were 10 years ago.”Central banks and finance ministries would have some options in the event of another severe downturn. Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics, says rates could be cut to below zero, QE could be expanded and governments could run even bigger deficits than they currently have.Serious consideration could also be given to the use of “helicopter money” – tax cuts and public spending that are paid for by a permanent increase in the money supply by central banks, almost as though the government were dropping money from the sky for citizens to spend.But Redwood adds a cautionary note. “Policymakers are not powerless in the face of the next downturn. Indeed, we expect their tools to prove adequate to cope with a relatively modest slowdown. However, if there was a more severe downturn, we think that policymakers would be reluctant to undertake the more radical steps that would be required – with a weak policy response raising the risk of a prolonged slump.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dfb3b5b46e3e532e3a8476ffa24c5c71cd82cc9/0_1019_6839_4105/master/6839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5efb73755a9a31287a406499d179c6a7","title":"phoebe waller bridge fleabag","story":"Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s series moves to BBC One ... and there’s no invite to binge onlineIt is included in the formal contract of every writer here that they must watch Fleabag and discuss how much they love both it and Phoebe Waller-Bridge on a regular basis, otherwise we are denied our annual bonus of discount Birkenstocks.Happily, Fleabag is returning for a second season on 4 March, which at least gives us something to go on.The comedy wrapped its story up so neatly in its first season, back in 2016, that some trepidation about its return is only natural.However, the new series trailer, released last week, suggests that such feelings may be misguided: there is lusting after a priest eye-wateringly candid counselling and the promise of a hot misogynist. Fleabag is back, baby!This time, though, it will air on BBC One, rather than online-only on BBC Three as it did in its initial incarnation, and it will be shown in weekly instalments. Actually, it was released weekly in 2016, too, but these days it feels almost quaint to make people wait seven days to see what’s going to happen next.Killing Eve, which similarly harnessed Waller-Bridge’s brilliance as writer and showrunner, was on television on Saturdays, but was also left online in one big juicy boxset on which one could gorge oneself instantly, should the appetite demand it.It is becoming more and more common for shows to be released all at once. Pure, Channel 4’s very good comedy drama, is still on, but I finished it in a week, because all six episodes were put online on the day it debuted. The series is not dissimilar to Fleabag, at least tonally, and its episodes are short, which made it a manageable binge. But once I had finished, I started to feel a slight sense that I had overdone it, that perhaps it would have revealed its charms more plainly had it been meted out by the week. Besides, I was sad that it was over so quickly. I see it in the television listings now and think, wistfully, about what could have been.There is so much good television that it is simply impossible to get through even a snippet of it, which means that delayed gratification is starting to become more and more appealing. The frenzy over Bodyguard last summer, in which we all – horror of horrors – seemed to watch the same programme on the same screen at the same time, so that we could talk about it together, showed that a reprieve from the “just-one-more” pressure of boxsets is certainly welcome, and perhaps overdue. Much like the second season of Fleabag.As winter comes to an end and spring pokes its sunny head above the clouds, and green shoots begin to appear once again, and life seems just that little bit less grey, along comes a news story that distracts from all the chaos with simple, flippant and silly joy.Nintendo has announced that the successor to its outgoing US president and chief operating officer, Reggie Fils-Aime, will be its senior vice-president of sales and marketing, Doug Bowser. “And I ask you, with a name like Bowser, who better to hold the keys to the Nintendo castle?” said Fils-Aime, in a farewell message to fans.“Literally anyone not named after one of Nintendo’s most famous baddies!” replied the collective voice of the internet, which was then drowned out by the collective voice of headline writers everywhere, who had a ball with “Bowser takes over”.This all happened once before, when Bowser – the man Bowser, not the spiky-shelled villain Bowser – arrived as VP of sales in 2015. He thanked fans by posing for a picture in front of stuffed Nintendo toys, including Mario and Luigi, who had been slyly tied up in the background. Nominative determinism is rarely as fun as this.Reading the words “property developers” in a news story has a similar effect on me as seeing the name of a long-forgotten celebrity you once loved: you steel yourself, take a deep breath and think, what have they done now?Whether it’s turfing out social housing tenants or segregating affordable housing residents, developers have been a ghoulish spectre in modern cities, driving up rent and property prices even while poverty and homelessness spread on their own doorstep.One of the many gruesome effects of gentrification is that it often suffocates what attracted people to an area in the first place. They buy flats built next a famous music venue, for example, discover famous music venues can be noisy, complain, then the venue is closed down.Three cheers, then, for Pauline Forster, who has been the landlady of the celebrated George Tavern in Stepney, east London, since she bought it in the early 2000s. Last week Forster had a rare “deed of easement” proposal accepted by Tower Hamlets council, which will safeguard the pub from future noise complaints. A Save the George campaign has been running since 2008, when a proposed development led to worries it would lose its status as a music venue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4102ee315eb44d4743cb4c05f9d247e703e8f5dd/0_397_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f1b69af74d8b7f071bb5451a1efc37","title":"early spring share your photographs and stories","story":"We want your help documenting the situation as record temperatures bring early signs of spring across EuropeAfter one of the hottest summers ever in 2018 and a mild winter across much of Europe, record temperatures are suggesting spring is once more beginning earlier than usual.Swallows and house martins have been spotted more than a month earlier than usual and temperatures are up to 20C higher than this time last year.

But good taste can only take a person so far. As Diana Vreeland had it: “Vulgarity is a very important ingredient in life.” Vreeland, who edited American Vogue in the Sixties, believed in vulgarity almost as passionately as she believed in red and pink and well-polished shoes. Without it, one might easily die of boredom: “A little bad taste is like a nice splash of paprika. We all need a splash of bad taste …. No taste is what I’m against.”When the death of the designer Karl Lagerfeld from cancer was announced on Tuesday, I thought of Vreeland, his only real rival in fashion when it comes to wit (not that there’s much competition). The two of them had various things in common: their striking, not to say odd, looks their tendency to adjust their biographies their aptitude for dashing, if ultimately meaningless, pronouncements. Above all, they both understood that good taste needs always to be leavened with a dash of bad: a little something to raise carefully manicured eyebrows. Look at a photograph of almost any collection designed by Lagerfeld and, even as you admire this jacket, that dress, there will always be one detail – a few too many pearls, a frill that is, well, simply too frilly – that falls into the category of vulgar.Such vulgarity – or bad taste, call it what you will – was ever-present in his own realm, too: the ponytail, the fingerless gloves, the diamante belt buckles. Lagerfeld, a walking, talking pageant of high and low, liked to mix it up: an urge born of the confidence that comes with being cultured in a world (fashion) where culture is not always at a premium. He knew all about opera, furniture and architecture. The owner of a vast library, he could read in several languages.He collected, among other things, jewellery designed by the great Suzanne Belperron, whose clients included Colette and Jean Cocteau. Why should he care what others thought of his too-tight jeans matched with a tuxedo? Of the tie upon which an image of his beloved Birman cat, Choupette, had been carefully embroidered, presumably by one of his own obliging petites mains?Lagerfeld was born in Hamburg in 1933. His father, Otto, made his money from condensed milk his mother, Elisabeth, was a former lingerie saleswoman who seemingly styled herself as a Cruella de Vil-style figure (it was Mutti dearest who told Karl his hands were ugly, hence the gloves). Naturally, this did not dismay her son in fact, it rather turned him on. In interviews, he claimed to have relished her sternness, her impatience, her plain speaking – and, to a degree, he aped them. To her we may trace Lagerfeld’s workaholism (he designed some 14 collections a year), his way with insults (“I think tattoos are horrible – it’s like living in a Pucci dress full time”), and his fear of abandonment (he fell out with his muse, the French model Inès de la Fressange, when she married, unable to share her).Having left home at 14, Lagerfeld finished his education in Paris. Already in thrall to fashion, and an excellent sketcher, in 1954, his design for a woollen coat received a prize from the Secrétariat International de la Laine, an award he shared with Yves St Laurent, later to become his life-long rival (St Laurent had created a dress). Apprenticed to Balmain, one of its judges, he then worked at Jean Patou. In 1964, he joined Chloé, the first of two stints at the label in 1965, he joined the furrier Fendi, with whom he stayed until his death. Finally, in 1983, he arrived at Chanel.The label was then in the doldrums, reliant on sales of scent and suits to middle-aged women (Coco had died in 1971). It was Lagerfeld’s job to drag it swiftly into the present.His mission was soon accomplished. First, there were his designs – not only edgier and sexier, but often echoing Chanel as it had been in the 1930s (to pinch once more from Vreeland: “the dégagé gypsy skirts, the ine brocades, the little boleros…”). Second, there was the label’s logo, deployed by Lagerfeld with more alacrity than was strictly decent.Once again, Chanel was the fashion status symbol. It spoke, as it always had, of taste and money, but now it came with a hint of fun, too. In the early 1990s I had a boss who owned a black Chanel suit, an item she wore like armour (she needed it, given the way some of our male colleagues behaved). But there was something cute about it, too, for its sleeves were trimmed with marabou, as if it were a negligee and made of diaphanous silk, rather than a boxy jacket constructed from tweed.In the days after Lagerfeld’s death, there were all the usual breathless tributes from the fashion world – and then, just as predictably, the accusations from other quarters of misogyny (the designer had called the singer Adele “too fat”, accused “fat mummies” of being envious of thin models, and dismissed the #MeToo movement).As a feminist who loves clothes, and thinks they’re important – as someone once said, they are the furniture of the mind made visible and, on occasion, the very mirror of an epoch’s soul – I see it from both sides: the brilliance at the drawing board, and the bully who didn’t like to see his female employees in flat shoes.One doesn’t necessarily cancel out the other. And he will be sorely missed. It’s fantastic that so many women are now running the big houses: making clothes for their own gender, with all the sympathy that involves. But Lagerfeld is the last of the last. After him, there is only marketing, PR-speak and certain boredom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4700ddc3d43de1f64f5e18a955decccd219aa627/0_0_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1b98663815847541af056512e85195","title":"the 12 key shows from milan fashion week in pictures","story":"From Gucci’s power suiting to a gameshow that inspired Jeremy Scott for this season’s runway for Moschino, Jo Jones picks her 10 highlights from the autumnwinter 2019 shows"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

How, the reporter wants to know, are people going to feel when they cannot easily get their hands on, say, some nice, fat, Dutch tomatoes? Will they miss them? Will their hearts ache for all that lost colour, for all those vitamins gone astray in wintertime?Each time, I wait and wait for someone to shout: please don’t make me eat turnips every day for a month! Oddly, though, this never happens. From the grey expanses of the pedestrian precinct, the answer comes back: no, we won’t miss these things. “It’ll do people good to go without,” someone will say, with a shrug. “We used to manage perfectly well, after all.”It’s never clear whether the halcyon age of making-do that these iniduals have in mind is one they can actually remember, or if they’ve simply taken the slogan on their Keep Calm and Carry On tea towel too much to heart – and needless to say, the reporter, hell bent on impartiality, isn’t about to push the point. As the programme returns to the studio, I always picture the vox-popped shopper walking into a well-stocked supermarket, where they promptly buy, without even thinking about it, a German cauliflower, four Belgian pears and a kilo of French potatoes.Such misplaced nostalgia. It’s enraging. You don’t have to be old – I’m in my 40s – to remember when choice in the matter of food was vastly more restricted than now. Of course we survived. That’s hardly the point. Life got so much better when all sorts of imported cheese, yogurt, fruit and vegetables began to be available (for me, this wasn’t until the early 1980s). People say: if there are shortages, everyone will just have to eat seasonally, and maybe grow their own – an idea I broadly favour until I remember my father’s allotment in its heyday. In winter, life was very … kale-based. In summer, my stepmother was a one-woman Birds Eye factory, frantically blanching broad beans for the freezer.But since I have the impression some of these people are really thinking about the war, and rationing, let’s trek back a little further. It’s easy to go on about snoek, a tinned fish so universally disliked that unused cans were eventually relabelled as cat food ditto Woolton pie, a concoction of boiled vegetables named after the minister of food. But these things can sound almost comical: mere props in a costume drama. I’ve always believed you get a better sense of the misery of rationing from what people missed. Their longing, like their hunger, is intensely chastening their cravings far more salutary than anything Meat-free Monday can achieve.In March 1944, the diarist Vere Hodgson noted that a shop near her Notting Hill flat had got some oranges. “We have seen orange peel in the street,” she wrote. “Most refreshing even to look at it.” Two years later, Elizabeth David, the future author of Mediterranean Food, returned to London from India, where she moved in with her sister, Diana: “One day, I took back to her among the broken biscuits and the tins of snoek … one pound of fresh tomatoes. As I took them out of my basket to show her, I saw that tears were tumbling down my sister’s normally serene face.” She asked what was wrong. “Sorry,” said Diana. “It’s just that I’ve been trying to buy fresh tomatoes for five years. And now it’s you who’s found them first.”Some of my friends think I’m a Brexit catastrophist – and I do see that whatever happens, things are unlikely to be as bad as during the war (though life could, I think, very quickly become quite 1970s). Nevertheless, I wish people would stop invoking what they imagine to be a plucky Blitz spirit. It’s they who have no idea how lucky they are, not the rest of us. This February, I find myself giving grateful thanks for every orange that passes my lips – whether it comes from Spain, Italy, or somewhere else entirely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a05812b981ade1ce3adfea94c6a283b081ccf89/0_0_3601_2161/master/3601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd22e695515639a60bd7d584d478c457","title":"soup recipes yotam ottolenghi chicken parmesan lemon lentil burnt aubergine","story":"A lemony lentil soup, a restorative chicken, pasta and parmesan bowlful, and a smoky aubergine broth thick with spicy goodnessContrary to what many believe, an outstanding soup requires real skill.

You can substitute the pappardelle for any pasta, really.1 whole chicken (around 1.4kg)1 whole head garlic, halved, plus 4 cloves, peeled and crushed1 onion, cut into 4 wedgesSalt and black pepper2 tbsp olive oil2 carrots, peeled and cut into roughly 15mm cubes (220g net weight)3 sticks celery, cut at an angle into roughly 1cm-thick slices (200g net weight)3 bay leaves1½ tbsp thyme leaves, finely chopped60g parmesan, finely grated, plus 1 small piece of rind 5 plum tomatoes, coarsely grated and skins discarded (320g)2 tsp tomato paste180g dried pappardelle nests15g basil leaves, finely shredded1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped Put the chicken, garlic head halves, onion, two litres of water and two and a quarter teaspoons of salt in a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer, cover and cook for 80 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a board, leave to cool slightly, then pull off the meat in large shreds discard the skin, bones and cartilage. Strain the stock into a medium saucepan (discard the solids): you need 1.7 litres, so save any excess for another use. Keep warm on a low heat while you get on with everything else.Put the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat, then saute the carrot and celery for four minutes, until they start to soften. Add the crushed garlic, bay, thyme and parmesan rind, cook for 30 seconds, then stir in the tomatoes and tomato paste, and cook for three minutes, until the tomatoes cook down slightly. Pour in 1.7 litres of hot stock, half a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened.Ladle out 400g of the soup, about 5050 liquid to solids (avoid the bay and rind), transfer to a blender and blitz smooth. Stir back into the soup pan and turn up the heat to medium-high. Add the pasta, chicken flesh and a good grind of pepper, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. Discard the bay leaves and parmesan rind.Divide the soup between four bowls, top with the basil, chilli, a good grind of pepper and a sprinkling of grated parmesan, and serve with extra parmesan alongside.Versions of this soup, in which lemon is king, are found all over the Arab world. Mine is ever-changing, depending on what kind of stock I have in my freezer, or herbs in my fridge, so feel free to play around with the ingredients as you see fit. I like my soup super lemony, but adjust this to your taste, too. If using vegetable stock, consider adding a couple of teaspoons of miso paste to enrich the broth. 200g brown or green lentils110ml olive oil2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped 5 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1½ tbsp cumin seeds3 lemons – finely shave the skin off 1 into 5 wide strips, then juice all 3 to get 75mlSalt and black pepper3 firm, waxy potatoes, such as desiree, peeled and cut into 4cm pieces (650g-700g net weight)400g Swiss or rainbow chard, leaves and stalks separated, then roughly sliced1 litre vegetable stock (or chicken or beef, if you prefer)1½ tbsp coriander leaves, finely chopped2 spring onions, finely sliced on an anglePut the lentils in a medium saucepan, cover with plenty of cold, lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the lentils are nearly cooked but still retain a bite, then drain.While the lentils are cooking, put 80ml oil in a large, heavy-based pot for which you have a lid, and put on a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions, garlic, cumin, lemon skin, two and a quarter teaspoons of salt and plenty of pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring often, until very soft and golden. Stir in the potatoes, lentils and chard stalks, pour in the stock and 800ml water, bring to a gentle simmer, then cover and leave to cook for 20 minutes, or until the potato is soft but still holds its shape.Turn off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and chard leaves, and leave to cook in the residual heat for two or three minutes, until wilted. Divide between four bowls, drizzle over the remaining two tablespoons of oil, garnish with the coriander and spring onion, and serve hot.This soup draws on both Middle Eastern and Indian techniques, and is everything you’d want from a bowl: it is smoky from the burnt aubergine, earthy from the greens and spicy from the tempered oil.

Randomly poke the aubergines all over a few times with the tip of a small, sharp knife. Once the pan is smoking hot, lay in the aubergines and cook, turning occasionally, until deeply charred on the outside and softened inside – about 50 minutes. Don’t worry about over-charring them: the longer they cook, the better. Transfer the aubergines to a colander set over a bowl and leave to drain for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the blackened skin and stems, then tear the flesh into long strips. In a medium bowl, mix the aubergine flesh with a tablespoon of lemon juice, a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Set aside until needed.While the aubergines are grilling, start on the soup. Heat four tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and deeply browned – about 12 minutes. Add the garlic, cook for 30 seconds more, until fragrant, then turn the heat to medium-low and add the chopped herbs, spring onions and three tablespoons of water. Leave to cook, stirring often so the herbs don’t catch, for about 15 minutes, until deeply green and fragrant. Turn up the heat to medium-high, add the cinnamon, cumin and a teaspoon of turmeric, cook for 30 seconds, then stir in the spinach, stock, 400ml water, a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium and leave to simmer for about 20 minutes.Remove from the heat, transfer 350g of the soup mix to a blender and blitz smooth. Stir the blitzed soup back into the pan, add the remaining two tablespoons of lemon juice, and keep warm.For the tempered oil, put the chilli and remaining three tablespoons of oil in a small frying pan and turn the heat to medium. Leave to cook, stirring occasionally, until the chilli is translucent and glossy – 10-12 minutes. Add the mustard seeds, cook for a minute, stir in the final eighth of a teaspoon of turmeric, then immediately tip the mixture into a bowl to stop it cooking further. To serve, ide the soup between four bowls. Stir the picked herbs into the aubergines, spoon on top of the soup, and finish with a drizzle of the tempered oil and spices."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34df6c32b4ef7c090cb852c80b73ae5ace7c9504/0_126_5297_3180/master/5297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19d054bc92b1f19a56dbabeaf9a88c2c","title":"nathan redmond southampton learning curve england","story":"The Southampton winger is finally recovering his confidence after enduring a torrid time since his England debut“There’s nothing worse than not being able to get past a certain point, which I thought was never ending,” Nathan Redmond says. Over his shoulder, the skies are starting to darken at Southampton’s impressive training ground on the fringes of the New Forest. Fresh from another demanding session after a week in Tenerife under the watchful eye of his club’s workaholic manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, Redmond is reflecting on a challenging period of his career that saw him miss the decisive penalty for England against Germany in the European Under-21 Championship semi-finals as well as be booed off by his own club’s supporters.“I wasn’t doing anything right, I hadn’t scored a goal and was not performing for my team,” he says. “There were so many things going on and I wasn’t doing anything to change it. I guess I had to go through all of those things to realise how fortunate I am to be playing football. But at the same time I don’t want to end up being somebody who wastes something I’ve been blessed with.”Ever since he became Birmingham’s second-youngest player at 16 years and 173 days in 2010, there has been no doubting Redmond’s talent. Now 24, he has scored six goals in his past 11 appearances since Hasenhüttl replaced Mark Hughes. He has recaptured some of the form that brought him his solitary senior England cap, as a substitute away to Germany, two years ago next month. But having been tipped as the brightest star of his generation after turning down some of the biggest clubs to stay with his hometown team, the period since that sole senior appearance has been what he describes as “the biggest learning curve of my life”.“I’ve got rid of a lot of things that I had been allowing to happen,” Redmond says. “One negative thought was leading to another and the smallest of things was getting me down. I didn’t understand how to deal with them the right way but the lessons will keep coming until you do that. I can’t be mad at anything that has happened.”His problems began during the under-21s’ tournament in June, when he injured a hamstring in the final group match against the hosts, Poland. It was diagnosed as a tear that would normally require at least three weeks’ rest but he decided to stay with the squad and came on as a substitute against Germany’s youngsters five days later.“I should have gone home,” Redmond admits. “I don’t think I fully understood how bad it was until I came back and thought: ‘Maybe I should have made this decision.’ But it was my last tournament for them and I wanted to give everything I could. I know a lot of the younger boys coming through did look up to me to be a leader off the pitch because I’d had a lot of experience and had been playing football from a young age as well.”The abiding image of England’s defeat that night was Redmond being consoled by his friend Nathaniel Chalobah, his eyes bloodshot from the tears that had been flowing steadily since his miss in the shootout. He admits following in the footsteps of Stuart Pearce, Chris Waddle, Gareth Southgate, David Batty and the rest who have missed spot-kicks in national colours had a profound effect as his confidence noseed, culminating in Pep Guardiola’s impassioned intervention on the pitch at the end of Southampton’s defeat by Manchester City in December 2017. Having reminded Redmond “how good a player he is”, the manager later revealed he had “said to Nathan: ‘You have to attack because you have the quality to do that.’”Redmond adds: “When Mark Hughes came in he understood I was in a bit of a bad place in terms of confidence. I remember having a conversation with my mum and I was thinking: ‘This is it.’ I didn’t know if I was still going to be at the club or play again. That was the kind of doom-and-gloom outlook I had.”Working with the fitness expert Andy Barr along with Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge and Chalobah – who is second on England Under‑21s’ appearance list with 40 games, two ahead of Redmond – he says spending last summer preparing in Los Angeles worked wonders not only for his physical condition but also his mental health. Yet it was not until Hasenhüttl was appointed that he realised the extent of his slump.“I almost thought I had reached my limitations. I came back at the start of the season and I thought I was playing pretty well but then the new manager came in and said: ‘You’ve got no goals and no assists in the league … what’s going on?’ We had a review in Tenerife and he’s like: ‘Look at what you’ve done the space of three months.’ We had a long discussion about everything but I don’t think I’ve ever scored so many goals in my career, so it made me think: ‘What if I had been doing this six or seven years ago?’ That’s what is exciting for me and hopefully I can keep it going.”The pain of their morale-sapping defeat against Cardiff at St Mary’s is still raw and Redmond admits they are desperate to make up for that against Arsenal on Sunday after slipping back into the relegation zone. He believes Hasenhüttl’s notoriously exhausting approach to training is starting to rub off on the players and is confident there will be no need for the heroics that saw Saints survive by the skin of their teeth last season.“We have a little bit of time before it gets to that stage – we can still put it right,” Redmond says with steely determination in his eyes. “But the quicker we do it the better.”After the last two years, he knows he has no time to waste."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b6fd5462d4551bdf484f93f758864d84a2be01/0_3169_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe87d92ffceaa51f42c72e8585fd9cc","title":"yann demange perpetual outsider identity finding my tribe","story":"The filmmaker was born to French-Algerian parents and made his home, and his name, in multicultural London. But he never felt a sense of belonging. Then Hollywood called … Where are you from? It’s a question I’ve always had a hard time with. And since moving to the US four years ago, I’m asked it on a regular basis. Maybe it’s the combination of a brownish face, London accent and French names that throws people off. Who knows? But this question, hearing it asked over and over these past few years, has forced me to confront unresolved questions I have about identity: how I grew up and how those experiences led me to being a director.People tend to like things compartmentalised and simple, but it’s never been that simple for me. I’ve never had any sense of a “national identity” or, for that matter, a sense of belonging to any one tribe. I’m mixed race: French white mother, Algerian father. So “I’m a Londoner” is my standard go-to short response when the question comes up. That’s the simplest answer I feel comfortable giving without getting into it.“Ah, so you’re British…” is the reaction I often get in the US. I always bristle a little at that one. “No, I’m a Londoner.”It’s complicated, so let’s stick to the short answer, bruv. I’ve never been able to identify as British, not when I was called “Paki” by Brits for most of my childhood. I feel similarly about being French. I’m a French passport holder, I’m legally French, but I haven’t lived in France since the age of two. I can’t call myself Algerian either. I grew up largely estranged from my father and, although I studied Arabic at one stage in my teens, I don’t speak it, which pains me.Add to the mix that my mother was raised Catholic, but isn’t religious, and my father is Muslim. Yet neither “gave” me a religion to follow, or wanted to dictate a cultural identity for me. My parents left me to figure out my identity. Neither claimed me for their tribe. So at a very early age, one thing became clear: I’d always be an outsider.Eventually I came to realise I’d always be a Londoner, too. Being a Londoner is something I could always accept and own. It transcends national connotations. It’s a vibe, attitude, swag, banter. It doesn’t have a flag or passport or past atrocities attached to it in the same way. But I’m also a particular type of Londoner, one of the multicultural mongrels who came of age in the 1990s and found expression in the rise of the jungle, drum and bass, and then the UK garage music scenes. A common language emerged across races that bound working-class Londoners living within the “melting pots”, as opposed to those posh Londoners who lived in close proximity to us, but didn’t experience ersity beyond sharing a postcode.But the question “Where are you from?” goes to the heart of an identity issue I have found myself forced to face all over again, when I was somewhere I felt more out of place than ever: in a white, privileged, Hollywood bubble.Slowly, as the dust settled and the political rhetoric of the ongoing election debates was kicking in, I started to feel a strange loneliness and discomfort. I’d gone from living in a particular part of London that was a genuine melting pot of ersity, coming from a family of multiple ethnicities, to living in the most segregated society I had ever experienced. And – get this – I was bunched in with the whites for the first time in my life. Me? One of the privileged whites?Don’t get me wrong: London is no mecca of equality. We may have ersity among the working-class communities, but that’s not to be confused with opportunities within my own industry. Along with many of my – shall we say “ethnically erse” – peers from the UK, I had to migrate to the US in order to have a real chance at a career with some scale. Diversity in the industry is surface-level back home, as are the stories told in film and on TV.In LA, there were opportunities for me. But who was going to be my tribe? Where could I fit in?In looking for an answer, I had to think back to my multicultural family. I was born in Paris in 1977, and two years later I was an immigrant. My family moved to south London, then west. My mother is light, can’t go in the sun, whiter than white. My father was born and raised in Algiers, grew up during the war for independence from France, and moved to Paris at 18. I have two older brothers, each with a different father – one is Afro-Caribbean the other is Argentinian and half-indigenous.My mother and father broke up soon after they came to London, and I was fostered from the age of four to 12 while my mum found her feet as a single mother and immigrant. I had two four-year stints with different families in Essex. The first was with a French-speaking household, and the second was with a white Cockney family. I have never quite shaken the accent that gave me.The families who took me in were decent people. But they weren’t my family, and they certainly weren’t my tribe. I wasn’t well received in Essex. I remember trying to reason with some white Cockney kids calling me “Paki” at school once. “I’m North African. I ain’t Pakistani.” Blank looks. “You’re still a fucking Paki.” That summed it up. “Paki” was how they saw anything “other”, between their understanding of complete whiteness and what they could clearly discern as blackness.My eldest brother, Eric, who is 17 years older than me, was my hero growing up. Once my father was gone, my brother filled that role. He was anxious to help me avoid the painful experiences of racism he’d had growing up in France and was still experiencing as a young black man in London. He was there during the Brixton riots, and had his fair share of battles with racists.I remember how confident he was when he came back from a stint living in New York in the late 80s. It was an important, empowering trip for him. He had discovered his blackness. He was wearing Spike Lee merchandise, reading African American literature, had started playing basketball and was wearing caps, which, believe it or not, was fucking radical in London at the time. His year in New York had given him an attitude and confidence that I loved he’d found a personal way of owning and being proud of his blackness. It was unapologetic – and I wanted in.This was round about the time that Tim Burton’s Batman came out, which was the same year Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing was released, the latter being the cultural phenomenon of the year and a bit of a game-changer. My brother came home wearing a T-shirt with the Batman logo, except it said “Blackman”. I remember thinking that was the coolest thing in the world. I wanted one! It was awkward for my brother, but he had to explain why I couldn’t wear that. He was black. I wasn’t.“I know, but we’re family, right?”“Nah, cultural and ethnic identity don’t work that way, bro.”All this confusion even extended to my name. My given first name is Mounir, but my brother convinced my mother to change it to Yann. He had experienced so much racism as a young black man in France, and he told my mother I would have the same fate as an Algerian. So Mounir became my middle name once my father left, and I was too young to have a say.I wonder if on some level he was right. Would Mounir Hanine have been a filmmaker, too? Perhaps Mounir Demange would have had a clearer sense of tribe. Perhaps he would have been “claimed” or embraced by the North African community more? Who knows?Through all this, I really wanted my own culturally empowering moment, like my eldest brother had experienced in New York it felt like the missing piece I needed. So in the summer of 1991 I went to Algeria. I remember the feeling when I first got there, of looking around and seeing that the majority of people looked like me. It was undeniable that I was from this tribe, genetically speaking at least. But I couldn’t speak Arabic and, though I was making an effort to live as a Muslim at the time, I didn’t know how to truly be one. I was still an outsider.It was on this trip that I first saw The Battle of Algiers, when my cousins screened it for me. My family was incredibly proud of the film, as are many Algerians, but they were particularly proud and obsessed with the film because my aunt starred in it. She played the beautiful woman who plants the bomb in the milk bar. This was the only time she ever acted in anything.The director, Pontecorvo, used a lot of non-actors, something I would later do myself. I loved the fact he used real people and channelled who they were and what they could bring. Not only does this give the people you are depicting some ownership over their story, but the sense of authenticity and the experiences they bring to the process can help a film to feel truly immersive, rather than a story “told”, I think.So I had “returned” to the family, and I would now come every school holiday and get to know them all properly and perhaps start to have a sense of tribe. Or so I thought.It was 1991, and in the background a political conflict was brewing. The FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) had won the local elections, so the government cancelled the national elections. After I returned to London an all-out civil war broke out. More than 250,000 people died over the proceeding decade. Every time a school holiday came around, it was too dangerous for me to risk going back to see my family. I never saw them again. I have not been back to Algeria since that original trip.Knowing my aunt had been in The Battle of Algiers strengthened my love for film. As absurd as it sounds, on some level I think I felt like I had discovered an inheritance to some sort of personal lineage in movies. It gave me a kind of connection and claim to film. I may just be projecting this on to it now, of course – the human need to try to make sense of, and find meaning in, narratives being so strong.I never thought of film as a possible career path the notion would have been absurd to me at the time. It was simply my medicine, my comfort and escape. Film showed me there were so many people living many different lives, and they were all really complicated. I found comfort in that.My first American movie, White Boy Rick, was released in December, and is based on a true story. A father-son story set in Detroit in the mid-80s during the crack epidemic, it’s about a 14-year-old named Rick, the only white kid left in the east side of Detroit after “white flight”, who becomes completely immersed in the African American community. He’s an outsider, an “inside outsider”, like so many of my protagonists have been.I arrived in the US to make the film at a strange time. Trump was gearing up to run for president, and a Brexit movement was brewing back home. We know how that all turned out. The landscape has changed. People seem increasingly reluctant to engage with the “other” right now, and there is a global shift towards nationalism. Everyone is tribing up again and calling each other out. Lines are being drawn in the sand.I guess my tribe is the tribeless. I have come to terms with the fact that I will remain a perpetual outsider. But now I know who I am. I am an outsider. Yes, I’m still seeking. Yes, it’s still confusing, but what I do as a filmmaker is embrace that question mark. I know first-hand the importance of telling the stories of people who are under-represented, particularly during a time when the discourse is becoming increasingly black and white. So I’ll continue to explore outsiders in storytelling, in the hope that it may some day unlock something for me, or lead to some sort of inner peace. And I’ll continue giving my short answer to the question “Where are you from?” Because as you can see, the alternative answer can go on for-fucking-ever, innit.

Its importance was marked out in sewn domestic niceties: embroidered tray cloths, cheval sets and tea cosies. My home had a sewing machine in the corner, an ever-ready sewing workbox by my mother’s chair and a box that brimmed with buttons for us children to rifle through by way of entertainment. This was my material world.Living in industrial Glasgow, a city grimed with soot, smog and smoke, my landscape was monochrome until the day, when I was about six years old, my mother took me to an Aladdin’s cave in the city centre. There she bought me linen cloths already stamped with floral flourishes, packets of gold-tipped needles and silver scissors with handles shaped like a bird’s wings – and she let me choose loops of embroidery threads from a carousel of colours that dazzled me.I had never seen so many hues of green, such a variance of red, blues that stretched from daybreak to midnight skies and all the shades in between. It was a revelation. On my way home, I held my trove of colours tight in my hand. Such a rainbow was treasure and it was mine. When there was little I could call my own, this bundle of sewing materials represented not just luxury but the thrill of sole ownership.Even today, I cannot pass a display of embroidery threads without my heart missing a beat. Sometimes I even dream about textiles. I trail my hand through long-forgotten fabrics – crepe de chine, duchess satin, tulle net – grazing my knuckles on a crust of beading, smoothing down lengths of fringing and stroking the braille of lace. When I wake, it is always with the sharp pang of loss because the textiles I touch in my dreams have never existed, so there’s no hope of their rediscovery.It was my mother who taught me how to sew. She guided me through the simplest of stitches – back stitch, blanket stitch, lazy daisy, French knots – and, through them, I discovered another way of writing, inscribing my cloth with motifs and patterns that seemed to speak of an elsewhere, a world more delicate than the rough and tumble of my own.My dolls became dressed in sumptuous gowns encrusted with beads the clothes I eventually learned to make for myself were graced with decorative stitchery. I liked the demands of embroidery, its requirement for concentration, its quietude. Its absorption offered me a retreat from the bluster of family life. Being the youngest of four children I had no place of my own. I shared a bedroom with my sisters and was squeezed among my three siblings in the back seat of the car. Grouped, as we were, by my parents into “you four” or “you children”, any sense of separateness was elusive.But, through sewing, I could delineate a personal physical space. Needlework cocooned me in a privacy of sorts and while I have never lost my love of sewing as a private pleasure, in my chosen career path as a community artist, I made my sewing into a public art. Through sewing, I devised projects to involve socially marginalised people, encouraging them to create large-scale banners and wall hangings so they could tell the stories of their lives. I discovered a different kind of peacefulness in community sewing: the collective concentration and camaraderie of a common endeavour.When I began to research my book, exploring the social, emotional and political significance of sewing, I discovered that during the Second World War, women who had crafted quilts and signature cloths in POW camps hadn’t made them in jolly spirit-reviving sewing bees. Instead, each woman sewed privately, reclaiming solitude and inidual expression among the overcrowded and claustrophobic atmosphere of a camp where they were registered as a number. Through their embroidery they made time for themselves and through their sewn autographs they asserted their identity.I read about Ruth First, the anti-apartheid campaigner who, faced with long-term imprisonment in solitary confinement, took up needlework to take control of her time. On the back of her lapel she stitched seven black lines to mark her days, but then would unpick one or two as if to gain time, or go forward at her own pace by sewing down the days that lay ahead. Hers was an act of both rebellion and self-preservation.Today, in prisons throughout Britain, the organisation Fine Cell Work involves hundreds of men in embroidering items to sell online or make to commission. Paid for what they create, these men also stitch alone in their cells, finding respite from the clang and boom of prison life in the small oasis of peace afforded them by the rhythmic, repetitive act of sewing. Their needlework brings them sensory salve in the silken slip of thread and the soft crumble of cloth, a tactile antidote to the harsh and hard environment that surrounds them.After the First World War, doctors experimented with getting shell-shocked soldiers to embroider as a way of healing mental scars and it proved a surprisingly effective way of steadying their hands and settling their minds. The Disabled Soldiers’ Embroidery Industry was established offering war-torn ex-servicemen, isolated in their homes or in makeshift hospitals, the opportunity to earn some much-needed income and rebuild their self-esteem. From the unlikely marriage of men of war and fine needlework, occupational therapy was born and has remained a mainstay of medical practice ever since.There have been many studies exploring the relationship between creativity and well-being: the benefits, particularly for those suffering from mental illness, of the mesmeric immersion in crafts as a relief from inner turmoil. I know for myself that it is what I turn to to cope with anxiety and, at times, grief. The banner I made for the chapel at Stirling Royal Infirmary, to commemorate the 16 children and their teacher who were shot dead in Dunblane in 1996, became a way for me to stitch down the sorrow I felt at the loss of my own children after two miscarriages. In the time and contemplation taken – embroidering an angel, her skirt strewn with poppies of remembrance, her arms wrapped protectively around a child – I found another way to mourn, a solace of sorts.When my sister and I sat with our dying mother, for four days and nights I sewed. Although, by that time, she was in a coma, I like to believe she sensed our presence, heard me describing my work-in-progress and acknowledging the skill she had passed on to me. I still have the cloth I embroidered then. It evokes our last days together, connects me to her still and gives me comfort. This is the healing power of sewing: a way to express, sometimes exorcise, pain using a tactile language scripted by a needle and thread.Sewing is increasingly becoming recognised as an effective way to combat depression, the absorption demanded by needlework – its flow – calming the mind and reducing stress. The sense of accomplishment can boost mental health and improve our immune system, as relief from the pressure of multitasking is replaced by focussing on one thing.Today, through social media, people who are mentally frail can share their interest and skill in sewing without having to encounter the challenges of the wider world. The blog @sewcialists is a platform for those who have discovered a coping mechanism for mental illness or depression through sewing, helping them to connect by sharing stories. Sewing can also benefit dementia sufferers, translating their reminiscences into tactile quilts. Fashioned from vintage patterns and textures, they provide a sensory trigger to memory, as a prompt to conversation with carers and relatives. In our social media age, as we become more physically distanced from each other, sewing is a safeguard to isolation, a way to stay in touch with each other: hand and mind working in harmony to convey what lies in our hearts. For me and others, it sustains not just a sense of self but of belonging.Threads of Life: a History of the World Through the Eye of a Needle by Clare Hunter is published by Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton at £20.

I remember thinking, “I’ll still be good then” – and here I am.I do wonder if part of why I’m still relevant is because I haven’t had surgery. I look real. The popularity of plastic surgery shows the insecurity women feel. We can lose touch with ourselves with the menopause and become frantic that the physical aspect of us is what is going to keep men happy. But a human being’s real needs are about warmth.My father was a great listener and talker. He was intent on saying: “If you are interested in people you will always have friends.” I think he was completely right. Listening well is so important.Conversation is always the most important part of my day. A lot of people don’t look at each other when they talk these days, but it’s not for me to make judgments about people being on their phones all the time.I was an anxious child and don’t think I would have been very good at social media if I were a girl today. It is important to notice. I’ve always been sensitive to moods and nuances. I’m amazed when I see people blather on without seeing how someone is feeling.We are living a malady of narcissism at the moment. It is everywhere, particularly in politics in the US – the lack of truth, the preening, the lying. It’s dangerous and creating such terrible disdain of the other.I never planned on going to America and being part of the Hollywood scene. I had no burning desire to be there. I stayed there because I fell in love with someone.On the rare occasion that men were sleazy with me back then, it was just out of the question I would function on that level. I didn’t swear back then, but learned a few words I used when necessary.My father used to call and say: “Do you still have your self-respect?” And I would say: “Yes, Daddy.” What he meant was: are you still a virgin? I answered truthfully. I was a late-bloomer. At a certain point he stopped asking.Ambition is something to be careful with. Being greedy is rarely a good idea. It’s normal to want to get better at your job or your art if you’re well-focused, but I think if you’re climbing a mountain it is best to do it a step at a time, with a sure foothold. There is always a lot of incredible talent out there, so it’s a matter of attitude.

Then, when the mercury drops, we’re somehow shocked that the sun is setting at 4pm, our monthly budgets are desperately contorting themselves around Christmas obligations, and we’re spending 20-30 minutes every weekday morning in silent negotiations with every instinct inside us that’s demanding we stay cocooned up in bed as the working day approaches.I’m one of those ungrateful types who says silly things like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by late August, which is testament to this annual amnesia. Sure enough, when winter comes around, I’m obsessively looking for any remnant of spring and summer to warm my spirit as I wait for the clocks to go forward again.Sunday is my day to fuel up on enough cosiness to see me through five days of early starts and pitch-black evenings, so all food, entertainment and activities must be warming and mellow. Cooking shakshuka for breakfast means I can let the stove’s heat wash over me (an alternative to using even more energy on central heating) as I impatiently watch my red sweet peppers soften in the wok, waiting for the perfect moment to add first the passata (I’m fussy about tomato chunks) and then the eggs. I eat hurriedly, using hunks of toasted sourdough bread as cutlery, racing to get the warmth in me before heading out into the chilly air.I don’t go far, as I’m lucky to live over the road from the epicentre of cosiness, Columbia Road flower market. The trees that line my street have been stripped bare by winter, so the market’s weekly bloom feels like walking back into May and June, even if I am balled up in a fleece and thick jogging bottoms. Strolling down the alleys that lead from the main road to the market, the sound of buskers singing blues music creeps up on me, accompanied by clinking pint glasses and pub chatter. To my right, windows framing candlelit cafe tables draw me in, leading my eyes to racks of 1970s tableware, costume jewellery and plant pots that spill out from a higgledy-piggledy shop and on to the wonky paving slabs.After I finally accept there isn’t a place in my house for a crystal glass decanter – a decision I re-examine every time I pass this shop – I join the crowded flow of bodies heading to the flowers. Towering bamboo overshadows us for a brief moment, giving way to a flurry of colour that feels psychedelically incongruous in the grey, dead January chill. I walk through, watching out for bewildered jack russells and small children, to soak up the sea of bottle-green house plants and flamboyant bromeliads, inevitable roses and hundreds more I can’t name – some that look like hummingbirds, some that look like pineapples (but aren’t), fussy ones that I’d likely kill in a week, and hardy types I could hopefully neglect without guilt. Then I loop back, looking for something to take home.My choice is slightly limited as I usually go towards the end of trading, when the lifestyle influencers have stopped taking photos and the sellers, eager to avoid lugging home too many spare cheese plants, offer discounts. By this point you can get a couple of really great bunches of flowers for a fiver, so I try to play florist and work out which colours and shapes are going to go together. Now it’s been winter for a good few months, I’m drawn to flowers that make me feel like I have the sun on my face – pretty little purple flowers that you’d see in a British park in summer, and sweet, warm orange petals that conjure up the taste of Soleros.While the flower market is full of life and colour, it is still winter, and I’m still cold. I timed my central heating to come on 20 minutes before I get in, so warm air greets me as I push the front door open with my bum, to avoid crushing my bouquets. I place the flowers on the kitchen side, and begin cutting the stems with inadequate scissors, the mixture of hard work and warm radiators bringing feeling back to my cold fingers. I make a feeble arrangement and stick them in a vase that I use because it belonged to my nan, despite its irritating tendency to tip over. They’ll live by the window, which looks out on marketgoers clutching their huge, leafy houseplants and marching home in single file like leafcutter ants in scarves and coats.Coffee made, slippers on and the house toasty, I squish myself into a corner of the sofa and get under a blanket that’s been warming on my radiator. As I lazily watch Netflix (or binge Beyoncé live performance videos on YouTube if I’m home alone or with sympathetic friends), I look up at my new bunch of flowers poking out from behind my TV. Their colours distract me from the grey skies and dull brick walls in the window behind them. I’m reminded that winter is temporary, the warm will return, and it will be so intoxicating I’ll say nonsense like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by August again.To stay snug and cosy, download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck – you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

They are likely to be issued by an insurance company for free, but the industry is warning it could take up to a month to obtain one, so if no deal happens and you’re booked to go away with the car this Easter, you will need to act fast.The official advice from the UK government is: “From 29 March 2019, in the event that there is no EU exit deal … drivers of UK-registered vehicles will need to carry a motor insurance green card when driving in the EU and EEA.”Note that a green card (and they do have to be on green paper) typically lasts only 90 days, and if your insurance renewal comes up while you’re abroad, you will need one for each cover period. The card applies to the vehicle, not the driver.Direct Line insurance says: “In the event of a no-deal Brexit, we have plans to ensure customers are provided with a green card if they drive in Europe on or after 29 March. Customers will need to contact us at least two weeks in advance of when they are due to travel.”In Ireland, where 30,000 drivers commute across the border daily, and where shoppers from Dublin frequently head to Belfast and vice versa, the green cards issued are likely to be valid for one year. Irish insurers have prepared 400,000 green card forms in the event of no deal, and some UK insurers are now proactively sending green cards to customers in Northern Ireland.Insurers say they are already incurring hefty costs to organise the cards and prepare their staff in call centres to handle an inevitable barrage of questions. The Association of British Insurers says it would much rather none of this was happening. “It remains the case that insurers do not want a no-deal Brexit it would be bad for the economy and bad for our customers,” it says. “We continue to hope these arrangements are never needed and urge the government, UK parliament and EU27 to agree an orderly way forward.”In a sentence You will have to buy an International Driving Permit to drive in Europe, at a price of £5.50, with different ones required for France and SpainIf there is no deal with the EU then recognition of UK driving licences in the EU ends. So British drivers will have to go to the Post Office and obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP), which you will need to carry with you in conjunction with your UK driving licence.There is a curious twist to the international rules which means that if, say, you drive through France and into Spain, you’ll need two different IDPs. That’s because the 1949 IDP convention covers Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Ireland, while the 1968 IDP convention covers all other EU countries, plus Norway and Switzerland.So at the Post Office you have to specify which permit you want, depending on which country you are visiting, or get both if driving between France and Spain or Portugal and Spain.And just to add a little more complexity, the permit you buy for Portugal will last three years, but in Spain you’ll have to renew it every year.The Post Office has set up a webpage dedicated to this process. But you can’t buy it online – you’ll have to head to a Post Office with your driving licence, passport and a passport-sized photograph.As regards driving back and forth between the UK and Ireland, there has been significant confusion.Last September the government’s official position was that an IDP would be required if driving across the Northern Ireland border. But in January this advice was withdrawn, and it now says: “If you hold a UK driving licence you should not need an IDP to drive in Ireland from 29 March as Ireland does not currently require IDPs to be held by driving licence holders from non-EU countries.”It was also revealed this week that British citizens resident in Ireland – estimated to number about 300,000 – will be required to swap their UK driving licence for an Irish one at a fee of €55 (£48) if there is no deal on Brexit. PCIn a sentence They will no longer be valid and buying travel insurance will become essentialFor years, Brits travelling, studying and working in Europe have relied on the European Health Insurance Card (Ehic) that entitled the holder to state-provided medical treatment if they fell ill or had an accident in an EUEEA country.Two weeks ago, the UK government issued its latest advice on healthcare when travelling abroad, warning that if the UK leaves with no deal, our Ehics will no longer be valid.It has advised anyone travelling on or after 29 March to any of the EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, to buy travel insurance to cover healthcare “just as you would if visiting a non-EU country”.It has said it is seeking agreements with countries on healthcare arrangements for UK nationals after Brexit day, but no such agreements are in place yet. Those studying or working temporarily abroad already won’t be able to buy travel insurance as they have already left. They will probably just have to risk it as, alternatively, they face having to buy expensive local insurance, which will run into several hundred pounds.Ehic was never intended to cover long-term residents who had moved to another country, but many relied on it particularly if they spent only part of the year abroad, or for when they had just arrived in a new country. MBIn a sentence: Visa-free travel to Europe ends, paving the way for possible £52 90-day visasIt’s arguably the craziest prospect of all, but if the Brexit impasse is not broken, British tourists face having to apply for a visa to visit most of mainland Europe.That was the warning from Brussels this week where reports say there is a very real prospect of UK citizens having to apply for a €60 (£52) visa to enter the Schengen area, which includes most of the EU countries we generally visit.The problem concerns talks that have become mired in a dispute with Spain over whether the British overseas territory Gibraltar should be described as a “colony” in the EU’s statute book.If no solution can be found the UK will be left in legal limbo as it is not on the list of countries where a visa is required to visit the EU, nor on a list of countries with an exemption.It could mean UK citizens heading to Europe for Easter having to pay for a Schengen visa or be left waiting for a bilateral deal. In a tit-for-tat move, EU citizens coming to the UK would face a similar scheme. Further down the line, the EU is proposing an electronic visa waiver system valid for three years at €7.Questions also remain about how travellers will be treated when they arrive in Europe. Portugal is the only EU state so far that has said it will create a third lane at airport passport control to speed Brits through. Without a deal, they face having to queue with all non-EU passport holders, with the inevitable long delays. MBIn a sentence The government promises to keep EU flight delay payouts, but airlines could use changes to fight having to pay outEuropean Union flight compensation regulations have been fought in almost every UK court, so could a no-deal Brexit give the airlines another opportunity to stop paying passengers after a lengthy delay or cancellation?That’s the warning from lawyers this week – in spite of government promises that in the event of no deal, passenger flight rights will remain. The EU Withdrawal Act provides that EU regulations – as applied now – will convert into domestic law, meaning the same rules will continue to apply until legislators in the UK decide otherwise.On the face of it, passengers will still be able to claim to up to €600 (£536) in compensation when airline problems cause their flight to land more than three hours late, or is cancelled. They will also be entitled to meals and hotels if the delays are caused by problems beyond the airline’s control.However, with just over a month to go, specialist flight compensation lawyers say there has been no explanation as to how it will work. The compensation rules currently apply to all airlines based in the EU, and flights out of EU airports on non-EU-based carriers.The wording of the new legislation would have to watertight, says Coby Benson, solicitor at Bott and Co, because in the past the airlines have used any ambiguity to dismiss legitimate claims, and have fought them through the courts.“We anticipate that if the new adopted legislation is not entirely clear, the airlines will seize upon this to allow them to wriggle out of paying. This has been the history of this legislation from the start, and I can only foresee further court battles. If the airlines spot a get-out opportunity, they will try to use it to their advantage,” he says. MBIn a sentence The EU pet passport scheme ends for UK travellers and their cats and dogs – replaced with expensive tests every time they travelIf you were planning to take your dog or cat on holiday to Europe after a no-deal Brexit, you may want to think again after you have read this.The UK’s participation in the European Union pet passport scheme in effect ends on 29 March. It means that cat and dog owners (the documents also mention ferrets) will need to show that their animals are healthy – and produce new documents to support their animal’s health when they arrive in the EU.Pet owners will also have to show that their animal been effectively vaccinated against rabies by undergoing a rabies antibody titration test at least 30 days after inoculation, and no fewer than three months before they enter the European Union.Pets will need to travel with an animal health certificate issued by an officially registered vet. This certificate can only be issued up to 10 days prior to entry into an EU member state.This comes at a time when many veterinary practices are already experiencing worker shortages and recruitment problems, it says. The advice is to book well ahead if you’re planning to take your pet abroad. MBIn a sentence Phone companies say they have no plans to reintroduce charges – but don’t rule them out eitherArguably the EU’s most significant consumer benefit of recent years has been the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges. The EU first capped then finally scrapped roaming charges across mainland Europe in June 2017.It means EU citizens can use their mobile in another EU state as if they are at home. Call plans that typically include 500 free minutes and 2GB data can be used abroad without incurring extra charges, which, before the EU’s intervention, regularly cost more than the flight to your destination.But if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, has confirmed there will be nothing to stop mobile operators reimposing the charges.So hooked on smartphones have we all become, a return of roaming charges might be considered one of the worst impacts of leaving the EU.The biggest providers – Vodafone, O2 and EE – confirm they have no plans to reintroduce them on 1 April, but equally have not ruled out their reintroduction. Only Three has promised not to reinstate them irrespective of the Brexit outcome.Currently, EU mobile phone networks are not allowed to add extra charges to calls made by customers of other EU operators. That ends with a no deal.O2 says: “We will be working closely with the government and other European operators to try and protect the current arrangements, so our customers can continue to enjoy free EU roaming.”A future trade deal with the EU would include the abolition of, or limits to, mobile roaming charges, they have said. MBIn a sentence Retirees to Europe should worry about the future of their state pension, but private pension issues were largely resolved this weekThe 200,000 British citizens aged over 65 who have retired to the EU – half to Spain – still don’t know if their UK state pension will be uprated every year after we leave the EU, or whether they’ll join the “frozen’ pensioners” in Canada and Australia who have seen their pensions shrivel.The government has committed to uprate pensions across the EU in 2019 and 2020, but after that will only go ahead if there is a deal. It says: “We would wish to continue uprating pensions but would take decisions in light of whether, as we would hope and expect, reciprocal arrangements with the EU are in place.”If they are not uprated, it could leave retirees in poverty and force a return to the UK. Someone retiring to Australia 20 years ago still receives the basic weekly UK state pension rate of £66.75 prevailing at the time.But there’s better news on private pensions. For months the UK pension industry has been in limbo around whether they can look after a private pension taken out in the UK if the person has retired to the EU. But this week the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in Frankfurt said providers could continue to operate much as before, even with no deal.Steven Cameron of Aegon says: “There were concerns that UK providers might have been unable to service the policies of such iniduals. We very much hope EU regulators will confirm they are following EIOPA’s recommendations and will not treat these policies as ‘cross border’ which should allow servicing to continue.”Investments in funds, such as equity Isas, should be unaffected with a “temporary permissions regime” in place even if we crash out.In a sentence The EU-mandated £85,000 safety net will remain and the vast majority of UK account holders should be unaffectedThe immediate impact of no deal on UK bank account holders is likely to be minimal, but the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU is likely to rise and processing times become slower.Banks report that they have been receiving calls from worried Brits living in the EU who regularly access their UK-based bank account. Will a hard Brexit mean they can no longer use these accounts? The banks are assuring customers that they can continue to use them and transfer money overseas as they did before.Even if a bank appears to be from an EU country, there are few issues. For example, both Santander UK and Bank of Ireland (UK) are domiciled in the UK for regulatory purposes and post Brexit will be treated exactly the same as Lloyds or Barclays.However, there are those who are domiciled outside the UK and use EU membership to “passport” their services to the UK. But even here agreement has been reached, with a temporary permissions regime allowing them to carry on in the UK for three years after Brexit, and apply for authorisation during that time.The £85,000 protection for deposit accounts is partly the product of EU directives.But the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) says: “FSCS protection for UK-based customers of UK authorised firms will not change, regardless of whether the UK leaves with or without a deal.” PC"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6de41b69d082cb7f9f662243fbda2476ad1795/0_153_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a6e1b4ba602e790022a49d4b80196fa","title":"corbyn told change course before its too late for labour michael savage","story":"Senior party figures warn leader over approach to antisemitism and new Brexit voteSome of Labour’s most influential figures are urgently warning Jeremy Corbyn to change his approach to antisemitism, Brexit and factional infighting, as more senior politicians reveal they have already decided to quit the party.Figures across the party say that a major exodus of MPs, peers and councillors will be triggered over the next few weeks unless the demands for change are met, with some already poised to go.One senior parliamentarian told the Observer: “I have decided that I am going to have to leave. For me, it’s just a question of when.”With the Labour leadership battling to contain a wider split after the resignation of nine MPs last week:• London mayor Sadiq Khan is warning that the party’s response to antisemitism has precipitated a “collapse in trust” between Labour and the Jewish community• Tom Watson, the party’s deputy leader, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, are pushing Corbyn’s team to support a deal to secure a second referendum – with one of Britain’s biggest unions also backing the plan• One of Labour’s biggest former donors, Sir David Garrard, told the Observer he has already funded the Independent Group (TIG) of 11 MPs who quit last week• Senior figures are also calling for any attempts to trigger the reselection of MPs this year to be ruled out to help calm isions.The pressure on Corbyn to back a second referendum was increasing on Saturday night, as Tim Roache, general secretary of the Labour-affiliated GMB union, backed the Kyle-Wilson plan.“The clock is ticking and something needs to break the logjam in Westminster,” Roache said.“The prime minister refuses to budge, there is no genuine attempt to get consensus, and no deal would be an absolute economic disaster, so this needs to go back to the public.“The people must be the ones to decide whether Theresa May’s version of Brexit beats the deal we already have with Europe. If the prime minister is confident that her deal does the job, she doesn’t have anything to worry about.”In an online article for the Observer, Khan said that the last week had been “the most distressing and depressing of my 33 years in the party”, and that urgent action was needed to keep Labour together.“It is our responsibility to ensure that the Labour party emerges from these uncertain times ready to govern and able to attract those Members of Parliament who have left to return home,” he writes.“Over the last few years, it’s clear that Labour has been too slow at addressing the Jewish community’s concerns and at kicking out the minority of Labour members and supporters who think it is acceptable to use antisemitic tropes and abuse – both online and in local Labour meetings. This has led to a collapse in trust between Labour and the Jewish community.”His intervention comes as Garrard, who had donated about £1.5m to Labour since 2003, told the Observer that he had already started funding TIG. “I have watched, with ever-growing concern, the deterioration, especially over the past year, of the extent and nature of the naked antisemitism which has increased throughout the Labour party and its supporters, since Jeremy Corbyn and his cabal of revolutionaries took control of the Labour party which I had so admired and supported with commitment and enthusiasm.“From the very outset of Mr Corbyn’s leadership I had feared the ultra-Left MarxistSocialist nature of the Labour party’s new leadership and its supporters, all of which led me to conclude that a socialist republic for our nation was what these politicians intend.“I have observed the intimidation and the bullying that has become endemic within the party and its supporters for all to see, and it is therefore with a sense of actual relief and optimism that I’ve witnessed the emergence of these brave politicians who put country before party.“I am hopeful that there may yet be a bright outcome from the sadness and despair of what was once a proud and courageous Labour party. I’ve been asked whether I will financially support the new group. I have already done so.”The Labour leader and his team strongly deny any suggestion that they tolerate antisemitism.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, hit back at TIG in an article for the Observer, saying the group is “now the real barrier to change”.She added: “From what we have seen and heard so far, all that we know is they would continue Tory policies from endless privatisation to sky-high tuition fees.”Meanwhile, senior party figures are also calling on Corbyn and his leading allies to agree to delaying the process of reselecting MPs until after this year. Three party sources told the Observer that some of the leader’s allies were keen to start the process, which could lead to the deselection of sitting MPs. A Labour spokesperson said it was “categorically untrue” that any list of seats had been drawn up as part of the first wave of the reselection process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3b2f44d2f6760d9a288ccb83b8fc0118bc1f7e2/0_206_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b72b49868c66a289a3264b1b2786f396","title":"soviet vassal state jeremy hunt makes gaffe in slovenia","story":"UK foreign secretary criticised after statement displaying lack of awareness country was part of Non-Aligned Movement The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has incorrectly claimed Slovenia was a Soviet vassal state during his visit to Ljubljana to discuss the Brexit negotiations with his counterpart Miro Cerar.Slovenia was in fact the wealthiest state within the former Yugoslavia, which was outside the iron curtain and formed part of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).Yugoslavia had a chequered relationship with the Soviet Union. Its leader Josip Tito defied Moscow’s hegemony and promoted what he called independent roads to socialism.“This is my first visit to Slovenia as foreign secretary, not the first in my life, but my first in a professional capacity,” Hunt said. “And I’m really happy to be here, because as a fellow European country the UK is very proud of the transformation there has been in Slovenia over the last 30 years.“A really remarkable transformation from a Soviet vassal state to a modern European democracy, a member of the EU, a member of Nato, a country with a flourishing economy, growing its tourism year in, year out, and this is really an example of Europe at its best.”The former speaker of Slovenia’s national assembly Milan Brglez criticised Hunt for “arrogantly lecturing” his country and rebuked its own politicians for not picking up on the gaffe. He said they may not even have noticed the “insult”. “We have never been ‘the vassal state of the Soviet Union’,” he wrote on Facebook.“At a minimum what I expect from my representatives is that they will react immediately when someone insults the state and its citizens. And not that they are meekly silent, perhaps not even noticing the insult.”In a related gaffe reported by local media, the UK’s Slovenian embassy tweeted that Hunt was in the country to meet Karl Erjavec, when in fact he left his role as foreign secretary last year.Hunt is increasingly gaining a reputation for high-profile errors.

Previously she led a collaboration of around 3,000 physicists from 38 countries which co-discovered the Higgs boson in 2012. Last month Cern published plans for a €20bn successor to the Large Hadron Collider.What’s up with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)? The LHC is in shutdown because we are going to upgrade the accelerator complex. We’ll upgrade the injectors and the experiments and resume taking data in 2021 with higher intensity beams. We’ll run for three more years and then shut down again until 2026 to upgrade the LHC for the high-luminosity phase. Higher luminosity means more collisions. We can study fundamental particles in much more detail. We’ll be producing about 15m Higgs bosons per year.When the LHC switched on, physicists talked of finding the Higgs boson, dark matter and even extra dimensions. Are you disappointed not to have found more than the Higgs?Yes and no. Yes, because discovering new particles is fantastic. It’s very glamorous and fascinating and it means we have found new physics. No, in the sense that we know the open questions are difficult. It’s not obvious that we’ll find the answers with one collider. Research requires a lot of patience. And physics is not just about discoveries. The discoveries are the most glamorous part of it, but extremely precise measurements of known phenomena, ruling out scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Model, or a given theory, are important too. The discoveries make the front pages of the newspapers while precise measurements of a known particle don’t, but scientifically they are just as important.A theory called supersymmetry predicts the existence of partners for the particles we know already. It would explain why the Higgs is light, and perhaps even tell us what makes up dark matter. The LHC has found no sign of it. Is supersymmetry dead?I don’t know. Maybe supersymmetry exists but we haven’t seen it because we don’t have enough data, or it’s at an energy the LHC cannot reach, or at an energy no collider on Earth will ever reach. Or it’s the wrong theory. I can’t tell you. But, for me, it is important not to run behind a particular theory. We don’t know what answer nature has for the open questions. We don’t know if supersymmetry is the answer to the dark matter question or if it’s something else. If the answer is supersymmetry, then supersymmetric particles will show up either in the LHC, or in the next machine, or in some other way.You led the collaboration that announced the discovery of the Higgs boson on 4 July 2012. What was that like?It was the most exciting time of my scientific life. There is nothing more rewarding for a research physicist than to discover a new particle. And it’s a very special one. The Higgs boson was the missing component of the Standard Model. But getting to the discovery was a really a long path. It required the effort of thousands of physicists and engineers to conceive and then build the LHC and detectors, which are marvels of technology. When we realised what technologies we needed, it really looked like mission impossible. But in the end, we managed to build a fantastic machine with fantastic experiments. The performance is beyond our most optimistic expectations. It has been hard work, it has been teamwork and it was a fantastic discovery. All these elements together made it special for me.Last year, Cern suspended an Italian physicist, Alessandro Strumia of Pisa University, for comments he made at a workshop on gender and high-energy physics. He claimed that men, not women, are discriminated against and that he was passed over for a job that a woman in the audience got, despite him having more citations. He was suspended from Cern not for his ideas, because there is freedom of expression at Cern, but for publicly attacking colleagues in the audience. You don’t use a seminar, where you are invited to talk and to express your ideas, in front of an audience of young people, to launch personal attacks on your colleagues. This is a violation of our code of conduct that, as a first principle, is based on respect.Have you faced discrimination in your career?I never felt discriminated against, but some of my female colleagues were not so lucky. I don’t think I had to go through more difficult choices, more difficult steps, in my career because I am a woman. At least, I didn’t realise it if I did. I felt I had the same opportunities as my male colleagues. But again, I know female colleagues and friends who were not so lucky and did not have the same opportunities as men. There is still a lot to be done. We have to do a lot not only for gender ersity, but for ersity in general. Diversity is an asset of humanity, it’s our richness, and we have to use it in the best possible way.Last summer, your name came up as one of five women in the running to be Italy’s transitional prime minister. Are you tempted to go into politics? No. I can tell you that the newspaper headlines came as a surprise to me. I was not contacted about it. I am a scientist, I like doing physics. What I like about my job as director general, and it’s a fantastic job, is that I still have time to do scientific work. I cannot run an analysis or develop a detector prototype as I used to, but I can contribute to strategic planning, follow Cern’s projects, and participate in technical and scientific discussions.We should not underestimate that fundamental physics, not only in our field, is so ambitious in its goals that it is a driver of innovation. It requires development, construction and operation of instruments that require cutting-edge technologies, which benefit everybody. Not to mention the impact of educating and training thousands of scientists, most of whom go into society in other walks of life.With so much of the universe unknown to us, is there still a place for God? Science and religion are two separate endeavours. I’m an experimental physicist. My approach is based on what I see and what I measure.Other countries want to build huge colliders. Why is it important for Cern to have another machine after the LHC?A post-LHC will be a very important tool. It has a strong scientific motivation and will present extremely demanding and difficult challenges in terms of technology. That it’s a scientifically and technologically valuable project is demonstrated by the fact that other countries, other regions in the world, are discussing similar colliders. Japan is discussing the possibility of building a linear collider. China is considering a 100km circular collider. This really speaks to the importance of the project. With Cern, Europe has regained leadership in fundamental physics at the energy frontier and also in the advanced technologies that are needed to do these experiments. For me, it would be a real pity if that leadership were to go elsewhere in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a019915e07461f6fee3beb16e0b0008fe5972a5d/57_158_2456_1473/master/2456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc2edad1239bf549f4d7eb5656f7bd9","title":"abbie scott england women wales","story":"After such an emphatic start to the Six Nations, chalking up two wins and 92 points, complacency might be the most dangerous opponent for England’s women in Cardiff at lunchtime on Sunday.Not so, according to the Red Roses’ new captain, Abbie Scott. “Wales will be a big challenge,” says the Harlequins lock. “They’re a different beast away. We can’t be complacent. We’ve played here before and lost.”England, though, are playing on a different level to their Six Nations rivals and their 41-26 win against the champions in Doncaster a fortnight ago makes them near certainties for France’s grand slam crown. Only New Zealand, the World Cup holders, could live with them at present.But the England head coach, Simon Middleton, has made sure his side are not swaggering into Cardiff. He has made seven changes to the side that beat France and believes there is room for improvement. “It was a fantastic win but the mood in the dressing room afterwards was subdued,” he said “It was a great first half but we were disappointed with our defensive display in the second.”Middleton’s changes include picking Scott, who was outstanding in Doncaster, as captain instead of Sarah Hunter, who has to be content with a place on the bench. Poppy Cleall fills Hunter’s place at No 8 alongside the experienced flanker Marlie Packer, who has recovered from a shoulder injured in the win in Dublin. The only enforced change is the absence of Emily Scarratt, the centre who has been outstanding this year after returning from a spell in sevens. Scarratt has a foot injury.“It’s been very painful,” Middleton said. “She was tremendous against France but played the game on painkillers and was hobbling around on crutches all week. I’m optimistic that Emily will be back to face Italy but in the meantime we’ve got Rachael Burford back in the centre.“Rachael is one of a number of players being given an opportunity. I’d like to look at Poppy Cleall at No 8. Sarah Hunter has played a lot for club and country in the last four or five months and putting her on the bench will take a load off her.“Sarah Beckett is playing well and so we won’t be any weaker in the back row. We’ve a fantastic group of back-rowers. Marlie has a great skill set and loads of energy and she’s just the kind of player you need when facing Wales in their own backyard.”Lest we think there is only one team in it at Cardiff Arms Park and that a repeat of last season’s 52-0 win by England in this fixture is inevitable, Wales’s young side earned a creditable 3-3 draw against a resurgent Italy a fortnight ago and in the Ospreys’ Siwan Lillicrap they have a dynamic No 8 whose defensive capabilities – she is Wales’s leading tackler this year – will be invaluable on Sunday.But Wales’s coach, Rowland Phillips, admitted England’s power enables them to create a lot of attacking opportunities. Middleton’s team have scored a try every 10.7 minutes on average in this campaign and Wales, who have handed a first start to the 18-year‑old Scarlets flanker Alex Callender, face a long 80 minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45e665fbca2875e12555983a132fca8437016482/0_190_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=600749f569da288b13181e7278408db1","title":"wales england six nations match report","story":"From the sublime to the submerged. England, imperious in the Six Nations’ first two rounds, drowned under a tidal wave of emotion as Wales launched a second-half comeback to achieve their 12th successive victory and break a record that had stood for more than a century. It was a breathless, tactical, titanic battle that turned when Dan Biggar left the home bench on the hour.When the Northampton fly-half replaced Gareth Anscombe, Wales were 10-9 behind and had trailed for most of the match. Within six minutes they were ahead for the first time. Two years ago here it was England’s replacements who helped swing the match, but a feature of Wales’s unbeaten run since they lost in Dublin at this stage of the tournament a year ago has been the promotion of young players who have given them strength in depth.The experienced Biggar is not in that category but he was what Wales needed at a point in the match when lung-bursting desire and energy gave way to mental and physical fatigue. The England coach, Eddie Jones, had said in the buildup, presumably because of the landmark his opponents were looking to establish, that it was the best Wales team ever.If he was hoping his words would ruffle the home side and prompt them to play with hearts rather than heads, the arrival of Biggar ensured otherwise. Until then Wales had played with typical endeavour and spirit, neutralising England’s kicking game and putting pressure on their half-backs, but their best hope of victory looked to be their opponents’ indiscipline, which improved when Kyle Sinckler was replaced just before the hour.The prop, who had been singled out before the game by the Wales coach, Warren Gatland, as an emotional timebomb, had been explosive in the first half, making 16 tackles and winning the penalty at a scrum that gave England the lead after 16 minutes. Wales had had the greater possession and territory but were at times in too much of a hurry. England held them at arm’s length, running from their own half only after a turnover and kicking if nothing materialised after three or four phases, waiting for mistakes.England sabotaged Wales’s lineout and were a threat at the breakdown through Tom Curry, who scored their try after 25 minutes when, after Ken Owens had lost possession in his own half as Wales tried to drive a maul, he spotted his opposite number, Justin Tipuric, looking the wrong way at a ruck near Wales’s line and picked up for a soft score given the thunderous challenges that had preceded it.England had used their big ball-carriers, Billy Vunipola, Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes, to storm the gainline and make dents in defenders, but Wales held firm, forcing Ben Youngs and Owen Farrell to kick. Wales picked Gareth Davies at scrum-half for the first time this tournament and part of his brief was to put pressure on Farrell as a way of neutralising the threat of Jonny May on the wing and it largely worked.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsWales switched wings, putting Josh Adams, with his quicker acceleration and narrower turning circle, against May rather than George North. A year ago at Twickenham, Adams, in his second Test, was exposed positionally as May scored two early tries, but here he was astute and alert, reacting quickly to one kick in the opening half when Elliot Daly would have had a run to the line.Wales gnawed away at England’s 10-3 interval lead in the third quarter when two Anscombe penalties reduced the visitors’ lead to a point – the second after Sinckler, having just given away a penalty for obstruction, involved himself in a touchline dispute that had nothing to do with him.And the certainty that had sustained England dissolved. They had been content to keep Wales at a distance but could not respond when they needed to be more inventive. One Tuilagi run apart, they barely mustered a threat in the second period, when their only points came from a penalty secured by the excellent Curry, who forced Hadleigh Parkes to hold on after a tackle.Wales were unflinching, which galvanised the crowd – but they needed someone to create a spark. Enter Biggar. He played scrum-half after a 34-phase move and a North run that took out three defenders, flicking a short pass to the second-row Cory Hill, who had the strength to break two tackles and the reach to make the line, just.Wales were in the lead for the first time with 13 minutes to go. England needed to find a response but their chief tactic had been thwarted by Wales’s back three, led by Liam Williams, one of two who earn their livings in the Premiership, and also the first full-back with experience in the position that England had faced this season.The other Premiership player was Adams who, with three minutes to go and Wales looking to deliver a knockout blow and leave England without a bonus point, positioned himself on the right-hand touchline, exhorting Biggar to deliver a cross-kick – which the fly-half did with such precision that Adams was able to get above Daly, gather the ball at the second attempt and, summing up his team, make the line through sheer willpower. The score ensured the end of a run of five successive championship defeats against England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a339dfc725170ae68bcf8e8bf5cc7893bb69677e/357_0_3973_2385/master/3973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee261b60309f9d8c33fb59419881066a","title":"walt kempton cheltenham festival horse racing tips","story":"Saturday’s two feature races showed once again that those with only a small stake in jump racing are still able to carry off a big prize. The Eider at Newcastle fell to Crosspark, providing Northamptonshire’s Caroline Bailey with the most notable success of her long career, while the main prize here went to the Neil Mulholland-trained Walt, whose owner nearly quit the game a year ago after losing the only other horse he had.“We had one called Burns Cross,” Phil Simmonds recalled as he fussed over Walt in the winner’s enclosure, “and unfortunately he had a small injury on his foot. He went to the best veterinary surgeon we could find, in Newmarket, but unfortunately he died coming round from the operation he broke his neck.“I thought, I’ve had enough, I can’t live with that. But Neil said, stick with it, keep going, and it’s a tribute to him being so honest and frank with me that we’re here today.”Simmonds, who grew up in Rochdale and made his money in software development, said he had been meaning to get into ownership from the time, more than 30 years ago, that he attended Haydock on a stag do. He was delighted by this first taste of the big time and can now look forward to a tilt at the Ultima on day one of next month’s Cheltenham Festival.On a day when Graded prizes were mopped up by the big battalions of Paul Nicholls and Nicky Henderson, Simmonds made a plea on behalf of trainers who spend less time in the limelight. “From an owner’s point of view we need to support the Neil Mulhollands of this world more and more because they’re first-class and are up against it. I know there’s superstars out there but they’ve got the talent.”Mulholland picked up Walt for £30,000 at an auction in 2016 when the horse was sold out of Henderson’s yard. He was winning this contest for the second time in three years, following Pilgrim’s Bay in 2017, and has a fine record in such races but has still found it hard to lay his hands on the right material.“This season’s been up and down,” the Wiltshire trainer said. “We do have a lot of badly handicapped horses. The average price of a horse at the sale the other day was £115,000. So if somebody comes for a cup of tea and says, I’ve got a hundred grand for a horse, that doesn’t even get you an average horse, never mind the one you really want. It’s hard to compete with the big boys.”Meanwhile Crosspark’s Eider success was a cheering change of luck for Bailey’s yard, which lost its most promising young animal, Captain Cargo, to a fatal injury in training last weekend. Bailey said Crosspark might not run again this season but would be aimed at all the major marathon prizes next winter.Henderson unveiled a hugely promising young talent in Fusil Raffles, who ran away with the Adonis Juvenile Hurdle on his first run since leaving France. However, the youngster returned with a nasty cut to a hind leg and his recovery will need to go very smoothly indeed if he is to line up in the Festival’s Triumph Hurdle in less than three weeks.The Supreme Novice Hurdle is still the plan for Henderson’s Angel’s Breath, for all that he met his first defeat in the Dovecote, proving unable to reel in the Nicholls-trained Southfield Stone. “It’s sharp enough round here,” the Lambourn trainer said. “Nobody’s despondent and I still think two miles is probably the right place for him, on a stiffer track. He’s giving them all 5lb, the two of them came clear and he was running on.”A week after a brawl at Haydock that involved at least 15 men throwing punches, there was only a brief scuffle to report among the crowd here.

I knew he was going to use his boxing ability. I was working on my jab. He’s a very slick southpaw. The game plan worked, smart pressure. I didn’t get too much ahead of myself. I dominated pretty much every single every round. I believe I proved the doubters wrong tonight. They said I was going to get my head jabbed off. It was the most important fight of my career. He didn’t quit, man enough to stay in the ring.”DeGale, who needed an operation to repair his right shoulder, moved comfortably at the start, his southpaw jab busy and precise, although a trickle of blood at the edge of his left eye encouraged Eubank.If he sensed a window opening, Eubank went through it straight away. A notoriously slow starter, he was armed now with the fresh instructions of the American Nate Vasquez, and, swarming forward, caught his retreating opponent with a stream of solid head shots to force a count midway through the second round.The counter-puncher DeGale had been out-counter-punched and resorted to lunging under Eubank’s quicker leads and cocked right hand. “You’ve got to use your feet,” his trainer Jim McDonnell told him before the start of the fourth, and a couple of long lefts – one cutting Eubank’s left eye – got him back in the argument, despite getting caught near the bell.“Let your hands go,” Vasquez advised Eubank, but his feet did not dance for him to set up the openings and it was the Londoner who worked harder to take the fifth. Eubank’s energy levels rose at the halfway point and he rocked DeGale in centre ring to edge the sixth. Just as he appeared to be falling behind, DeGale came to life in the seventh, only to lose concentration again.The younger man now looked dominant for longer stretches and the normally elusive Degale was stopping more than his share of punches, although stop-start nature of the contest did not make for a great spectacle.DeGale poked out his tongue at the end of each round but did not often enough follow the gesture with anything substantial, his contributions speculative single-shot assaults. By most estimates, DeGale entered the championship rounds in deficit – and the spark remained missing, with his right eye leaking blood again. His balance and judgment had deserted him, replaced by desperation. A left hook disorientated him, and a follow-up salvo cost him another count.The mission had morphed from grim to forlorn for DeGale. Eubank smelled blood in every way, and stalked his man to good effect before shoulder-charging him to the canvas, which cost him a point in the 11th round. It hardly mattered. His prey was struggling on unreliable legs now, needing a knockout and surely doubting it would come. It didn’t.Another left rattled DeGale’s teeth in the 12 but pride kept him upright. It was pretty much all he had left at the end.On an interesting undercard Rio Olympic silver-medallist Joe “Juggernaut” Joyce stopped the (briefly) former world heavyweight title-holder, Bermane Stiverne, in the sixth round to put himself in the frame for a shot at the WBA’s “regular” heavyweight title, owned by Manuel Charr.A polite athlete who might more appropriately be called Gentleman Joe, Joyce was merciless as he doused the ambitions of the 40-year-old Stiverne, who lasted less than a minute in his previous outing, two Novembers ago against Deontay Wilder.Joyce and Stiverne sparred in America several years ago and mutual resentment simmered during the week, the visitor boasting that seven months of preparation had brought him to another peak, although entering the ring at a career-heaviest 19st 5lb hardly made him a poster boy for his gym. The argument that mattered was clean and conclusive.Throwing more punches than a middleweight, Joyce battered Stiverne to a standstill with jabs and crosses that flowed like honey. Down in the third, Stiverne took his licks but looked relieved to be rescued on his feet, mouth open, blood flowing, senses dazzled.Joyce – who prepared alongside Gennady Golovkin at altitude in Big Bear, California - does not have the one-punch power of Wilder, the pure skill of Tyson Fury or the all-round excellence of his friend, Anthony Joshua, but said ringside, “I’ve sparred them all but Wilder, and I think I’m close to that level.”He is still raw, and a little robotic, but the Juggernaut has the priceless qualities of determination and self-belief. And, while he will be held in a queue for a little while yet at the highest level, he is capable of taking out the 34-year-old Charr.Earlier, Lee Selby had to box through a crimson haze for the second time in his career, outpointing Omar Douglas, an uncompromising customer from Wilmington, Delaware, who seemed to think he could use his head as a glove – and, disgracefully, escaped censure.Selby, moving up two isions to lightweight, won 116-112, 116-112, 116-114, and ownership of the IBF’s Inter-continental belt insinuates him in discussions for a shot at the federation’s full champion, Richard Commey. Otherwise, he could hunt down Anthony Crolla, whose own late-career ambitions will be tested to the limit in Los Angeles on 12 April against the ision’s supreme technician, Vasiliy Lomachenko, who owns the WBA and WBO titles.On his best nights, of which there have been many, Selby always looked relaxed performing his magic. But his return after losing his IFF featherweight title to Josh Warrington last May was a bloody affair, and he did well to hold his concentration. Sliced badly around his left eye in round two, and late across his right eyebrow, he was a crimson mess at the finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa9ed2fb20ca76454f6cb6b03f15f21a60c4eb32/2366_1826_1346_808/master/1346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14db5675bfb0144c2d80882bd3aee94","title":"harriet lane q and a alys always stage adaptation lucinda coxon nicholas hytner bridge theatre","story":"The writer on seeing her first novel, Alys, Always, become a stage play directed by Nicholas HytnerHarriet Lane – once a journalist at the Observer – wrote Alys, Always, her thrilling debut novel, in 2012. It’s about Frances, a lowly sub-editor, who witnesses the death of Alys, married to a high-flying novelist, in a car crash. Alys’s death marks the beginning of a new existence for complicated, ambitious, underhand Frances. A stage version of the novel by playwright Lucinda Coxon (Happy Now?, The Little Stranger, The Danish Girl), directed by Nicholas Hytner, and starring Joanne Froggatt and Robert Glenister, previews from tomorrow at the Bridge theatre, London, and runs until 30 March.How did Alys, Always make the leap from page to stage?There was a tug on the line even before the Bridge theatre’s opening had been announced. Nicholas Hytner was looking to develop new stuff (one of the things that makes this theatre unusual). I met him for lunch, and when he said: “I’m pretty sure the play will start with Frances alone on stage telling you her story”, I got goosebumps because I could see he had a vision and was confident about that. With Nick, if he wants something to happen, it will happen.Have you and Lucinda Coxon collaborated on the script?I met Lucinda with Nick and thought she was fantastic. I’ve seen and commented on her drafts. But when you write a book, you let it go. Thank God the adaptation is not my problem. I have all the fun, none of the responsibility.I gather the fun has included sitting in on rehearsals. What’s Hytner like as a director?Nick has a serenity about him. The rehearsal atmosphere is quiet, warm, supportive. The level of detail – about everything – is extraordinary. So Nick’s notes recently included: “For the opening scene – Frances’s foil blanket – could you find a blanket that is quieter?”Did you base the inside-track journalistic detail on your experience of the Observer?Ish… although Mary, the novel’s grand literary editor, is more Condé Nast (where I spent a few years). Moving from Tatler to the Observer was like dying and going to heaven…You send up journalists. Do you have a low opinion of them?Some of my best friends are journalists. I loved being one. And Coxon has turned up the volume on the journalistic detail in a fantastic way.Frances lists three questions a self-respecting interviewer must not ask: a) where do you get your ideas? b) what would you have done if you were not a writer? c) do you have a routine when you work? Please answer them at speed…A) Conversations on the bus b) a jockey (when I was tiny) c) I wish I did I’m questing for the perfect coffee shop where you can sit uninterrupted for five hours. Because my sight is bad, the type on my laptop is really big and people can look over my shoulder.Alys, Always was written after you discovered you had a rare condition affecting the optic nerve?When I started to lose my sight, I had to pack up the journalism. I’d said to my commissioning editors: “I’ll get back in touch when things are back to normal.” That point never arrived. I did not miss the office stuff, the swotting up and sometimes scary interviewing, but missed the writing. We were living in a small flat that summer because building work was going on at home. The idea came to me one Saturday afternoon, and I couldn’t argue with it. The following Monday I started writing. I found the slow reveal of Frances’s character attractive.You have huge descriptive flair yet, intriguingly, you never describe Frances’s appearance. Will Joanne Froggatt need to de-prettify herself for the role (as she did as Anna Bates in Downton Abbey)?I hate being told what characters look like. Joanne might have to make a transition because Frances’s appearance improves…Frances is a good listener – are you?Not as good as I should be. But as I’ve lost my sight I’ve become less beady. Something awful happened to me, but everyone has their shit to deal with… As you get older, you realise that.• Alys, Always is at the Bridge theatre, London until 30 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ecb6f53d279f88a549b76eb72a58bb454e32882/0_0_1500_942/master/1500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b3be369d76bdce8c1dd8dcc81e3b542 700w","title":"facebook app data leaks","story":"Facebook is battling fresh controversy on both sides of the Atlantic amid claims that it has been receiving highly personal data from third-party apps.The swirl of bad news around the company comes after its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was criticised for meeting the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, having refused to appear before an influential parliamentary committee in Westminster.The meeting came amid speculation that the government may soon publish a white paper potentially paving the way for an independent social media regulator.But the Observer has been told that a row is brewing over how the regulator should be funded. A proposal to hit the social media companies with a levy has alarmed some in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) who want to encourage tech investment in the UK. Others believe the levy should be applied to a broader range of tech firms, including the likes of Amazon. There are also questions over whether the media regulator, Ofcom, should oversee the new regulator or whether it should stand alone.On Friday, a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Facebook can receive information from numerous apps even if, in some cases, the user does not have a Facebook account. Of more than 70 popular apps tested by the Journal, it found at least 11 sent potentially sensitive information to Facebook.These included the Flo Period \u0026amp Ovulation Tracker, which reportedly shared with Facebook when users were having their periods or when they were trying to become pregnant. Facebook said that it required apps to tell users what information was shared with it and that it “prohibits app developers from sending us sensitive data”.New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, called on its departments of state and financial services to “immediately investigate” what he called a clear invasion of consumer privacy. Last week, the UK parliament’s DCMS committee issued a scathing report calling for tougher privacy rules for Facebook and other tech firms. Zuckerberg has rejected the committee’s requests for him to appear before it. But last week he met Wright at his company’s Silicon Valley HQ to discuss tackling harmful online content.“There is a good understanding that the UK government wants to keep its citizens safe online and will be putting in place structures that no longer rely on self-regulation,” Wright said afterwards.But Labour MP Ian Lucas, a member of the committee, was critical of the meeting. “I too would like to meet Mark Zuckerberg, but not for a chat – to ask real questions about all the issues we’ve raised,” Lucas said. “We have a lot of questions. I accept that Jeremy Wright needs to speak to the tech giants but I think it’s a question of the tone he adopts.“The thing about Jeremy Wright is that he’s not really going to say boo to a goose.”Criticisms of Facebook’s attitude towards its users’ privacy exploded a year ago following revelations in the Observer that the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the data of some 87 million of its users without consent.Meanwhile documents posted online on Friday have raised further privacy questions. About 60 pages of unedited exhibits from a lawsuit between Facebook and Six4Three, an app developer, were posted anonymously on the GitHub site.Facebook responded in a statement: “Like the other documents that were cherrypicked and released in violation of a court order last year, these by design tell one side of a story and omit important context.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a12bb2b66919a0de7aa6de18f9b59fce630ecd3/0_112_4788_2874/master/4788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc6c20a7814d0bd32279381287468faf","title":"are you being scanned how facial recognition technology follows you even as you shop","story":"As digital billboards record customers’ reactions to advertisements tailored to them, just who is safeguarding Australians’ privacy?If you shop at Westfield, you’ve probably been scanned and recorded by dozens of hidden cameras built into the centres’ digital advertising billboards.The semi-camouflaged cameras can determine not only your age and gender but your mood, cueing up tailored advertisements within seconds, thanks to facial detection technology.There are now more than 1,600 billboards installed into 41 Westfield centres across Australia and New Zealand. Scentre Group, Westfield Australia’s parent company, emphasises that all data collected is anonymous and that they are using facial detection, not facial recognition technology (FRT).This means generic information such as a shopper’s age and gender is collected rather than the technology using photo-matching databases to identify who customers are. A spokesperson would not confirm whether or not Westfield would consider using FRT in the future.Retail companies are increasingly turning to facial detection and facial recognition software to attract and engage a distracted audience. Quividi’s host of international clients include Telstra, 7-Eleven, Coca-Cola, oOH Media and HSBC bank.Terry Hartmann, vice president of Cognitec Asia Pacific, the company that develops “market-leading face recognition technologies for customers and government agencies around the world”, says using facial detection commercially is no different to Facebook’s manipulation of users’ online search history for targeted advertising.“You’re not identifying who that person is, you’re just identifying the characteristics of that person. That’s no different to Facebook popping up ads you might be interested in and social media picking up people based on their clicking habits or the shopping that they’ve done.” While facial detection could be considered relatively benign, it is a step closer to the more problematic FRT.Dr Dong Xu is the chair in computer engineering at the University of Sydney. He says that under optimum lighting and using high-quality photo data bases, FRT is more accurate than humans at identifying faces and can now recognise an inidual from millions of photographs.According to Xu, the technology is even more reliable at identifying criminals – and presumably other people – than using fingerprints.This technology is still in its teething stages within the Australian retail sector, but FRT has significant investment and growth potential. International companies including Target, 7-Eleven, Walmart, Google and Facebook are all experimenting with facial recognition. The global FRT market is worth approximately US$3bn (A$4.1bn) and is expected to grow to US$6bn by 2021. Target and Walmart say they trialed the technology in-store to prevent theft and fraud, while 7-Eleven plan to use it to “identify loyal customers”. Facebook has been using facial recognition since December 2017 to help users “manage their identity online” while Google has also been using FRT for some time. China is the world’s leader in facial recognition, with more than 176m CCTV cameras. FRT is used for street surveillance and policing but also in China’s “cashless” stores. In these stores shoppers can buy products by simply scanning their faces, while in ATMS and hotels, all it takes is a glance to check in and take out money. Alibaba and Guess are now experimenting with a project called FashionAI. The project would fit FRT into changing room mirrors, allowing customers to see themselves in outfits without actually having to put them on.FRT has a number of beneficial uses. In Canada, it has been used to help those who have identified themselves as problem gamblers. In a number of international airports, the technology is used to speed up checking in and security procedures. And in Australia, it has long been employed by border security at the arrival gates and in national policing efforts to detect suspects from criminal watch lists.But there are major concerns about how to protect the privacy of those whose data is collected. In January a coalition of 85 civil rights groups wrote to Microsoft, Amazon and Google demanding the companies commit not to sell face surveillance technology to governments. When asked, Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, rejected the idea of an outright ban, saying: “A sweeping ban on all government use clearly goes too far and risks being cruel in its humanitarian effect.” He was referring to the reported use of the technology to detect rare diseases and also reunite missing children in India.But Microsoft has acknowledged the concerns about FRT and called for greater government regulation of the use of this technology. In a December 2018 Microsoft blogpost, Smith identified three main problems governments needed to address, namely the risk of bias and discrimination, new intrusions into privacy, and the potential for mass surveillance to “encroach on democratic freedoms”.Australia already falls short when it comes to regulations in this area. For instance, under the current regulatory framework, neither Westfield nor Quividi need shoppers’ consent or knowledge to monitor and record them through facial detection by their Smartscreen billboard cameras. Yet throughout Europe, Quividi complies with strict privacy laws implemented by the General Data Protection Regulation enforced last May, which gave citizens the right to control their personal data and be informed about how their information is used.Rather than burying information in the fine print of lengthy terms and conditions, the GDPR dictated consent must be clear, provided in an easily accessible form with clear and plain language. The regulation also stated it must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.There is now a bill attempting to regulate facial recognition in its second parliamentary reading. If passed, the bill would allow identity information to be exchanged between the commonwealth government, state and territory governments and “non-government entities” through the creation of a central hub called “the Capability” and the national driver licence facial recognition solution.The bill is vague, with no date set for its final vote. While consumer consent is required in the bill, it fails to explain how it would be gathered or what exactly is meant by “non-government entities”.Activists are concerned the Capability hub will contribute to potential data misuse and theft, with the bill unable to keep up with the ever-changing technology.“People are having information recorded about them. They don’t get to see it, they don’t get to correct it if it’s inaccurate, and they don’t get to opt out of it. These companies get to accumulate very personal information about people and create a data set that could be rife for theft or misuse,” says David Paris, board member of Digital Rights Watch.While Australia is worlds away from China when it comes to FRT, targeted advertising along with the infiltration of FRT into everyday life may eventually become the norm.Says Paris: “If we don’t do something about it, the technology will go down the path of eliminating any place where people aren’t surveilled. Unless we have a massive shift in the way data accumulation is governed and limited and protected, we’re in for a really dystopian way of living where we don’t get to escape those sorts of things.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25b4a6af8fc325d031fa44126e9c04e213e18f58/263_255_1375_825/master/1375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d15f68d97b6e8b370e7c4de07c9c33c1","title":"dianne feinstein sunrise movement green new deal","story":"Sunrise Movement says California senator reacted with ‘smugness and disrespect’ to their campaigning for New Green DealThe California senator Dianne Feinstein is facing criticism over a video of her response to a group of children and teenagers asking her to support the Green New Deal.The video clip shows parts of a Friday morning meeting between the Democrat and young activists from the Sunrise Movement. Founded in 2017, the group organizes young people to fight climate change and support the Green New Deal.When Feinstein pushes back on the young activists’ request, one child says: “The government is supposed to be for the people, by the people, and all for the people.”“I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’ve been doing,” Feinstein responds. “You come in here and say it has to be my way or the highway. I’ve gotten elected. I just ran. I was elected by almost a million vote plurality and I know what I’m doing. Maybe people should listen a little bit.”“I hear what you’re saying,” a teenage activist says. “But we’re the people who voted you, you’re supposed to listen to us.”“I’m 16,” the young woman responds.“Well, you didn’t vote for me,” Feinstein says.Later in the clip, Feinstein tells a young activist, “Well, you know better than I do. So I think one day you should run for the United States Senate and then you do it your way.”“Great, I will,” the teenager responded.The senator issued a statement Friday evening: “I want the children to know they were heard loud and clear,” she said, misstating the group’s name as the Sunshine Movement. “I have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation.”The senator reacted “with smugness + disrespect”, the Sunrise Movement tweeted on Friday, sharing a video clip of the meeting. “Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress.”By Friday night, the video the Sunrise Movement shared on Twitter, which had been edited and focused on clips of the most tense moments from the meeting, had been viewed more than 3m times.The full video of the meeting between Feinstein and the young activists was also available on the group’s Facebook page. Some viewers said they found the full video, which includes more conciliatory moments between Feinstein and the young protesters, less shocking than the edited version.In the full video, Feinstein repeatedly urges the young activist to read her draft legislation and explains the reasons she cannot support the Green New Deal. “There’s no way to pay for it,” she tells the children.“It doesn’t have a single Republican vote, and the Republicans control the US Senate,” she adds. “I’ve been in the Senate for over a quarter of a century, and I know what can pass and I know what can’t pass.”The Green New Deal, a proposal that aims to fight inequality and tackle climate change at the same time, is being advanced by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among other Democratic lawmakers. The proposal could face a vote in the senate as early as next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c4e8ac762a5b2e5996be7262e8535118f8566d0/0_28_1350_810/master/1350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0994f14aad0d331f12fe56d4498c8d6f","title":"saudi arabia appoints its first female ambassador to us","story":"Saudi Arabia has named a princess as its first female ambassador to the United States, a key appointment as the fallout over journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder tests relations between the allies.Princess Reema bint Bandar replaced Prince Khalid bin Salman, the younger brother of the powerful crown prince who was appointed vice defence minister in a flurry of late-night royal decrees announced on state media.The reshuffle comes as Saudi Arabia seeks to quell an international outcry over Khashoggi’s murder last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which strained relations with its key ally.After initially denying no knowledge of Khashoggi’s disappearance, the kingdom finally acknowledged Saudi agents killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation.Princess Reema faces hostile US lawmakers who have threatened to take tough action against Saudi Arabia over the brutal killing amid claims that the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman – the de-facto ruler who also serves as the defence minister – was personally responsible.The Saudi government has denied he had anything to do with the murder of Khashoggi, a royal insider-turned-critic who was a columnist with the Washington Post.“The appointment of a new envoy signifies an attempt by Riyadh to try and reset relations with Washington and draw a line under the Khashoggi affair, however unlikely that may be in practice, at least with congress,” Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute in US, said.Princess Reema, the daughter of a former longtime ambassador to the US, has been a leading advocate of female empowerment in the kingdom, which has long faced criticism over its treatment of women.The princess previously worked at the kingdom’s General Sports Authority, where she led a campaign to increase women’s participation in sports.Prince Khalid, a son of the king, and who served as ambassador since 2017, had been expected to leave Washington for some time – particularly after the global outcry over Khashoggi tarnished the kingdom’s reputation.His new appointment as deputy defence minister comes as a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia remains bogged down in a four-year conflict in neighbouring Yemen.It comes around a year after the crown princeannounced a military reform plan and a dramatic overhaul of top defence commanders.“As the Yemen war drags on and the military reform program continues to move painstakingly slow, Prince Khalid is gaining a difficult portfolio but one that is critical to his father, brother and the kingdom,” Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based Rand Corporation, said.“Prince Mohammed has struggled to delegate authority within this file which has rendered some efforts – chiefly military reform – stagnant, and Prince Khalid’s appointment may be an attempt to reinvigorate these initiatives.”Khashoggi’s killing has refocused attention on the Saudi-led coalition’s bombing campaign in Yemen, which is gripped by what the UN calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.Earlier this month, the US House voted overwhelmingly to end American involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war effort in Yemen, dealing a rebuke to President Donald Trump who has publicly thrown his support behind the crown prince.US lawmakers this month also said they were probing whether Trump was rushing to sell sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia to please corporate supporters who stand to profit handsomely.The House of Representatives committee has voiced fears that Saudi Arabia could convert US expertise into making a nuclear bomb, heightening already severe tensions with regional rival Iran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/751f941bf3fd6ecf4d7568b0617cd232d6a9c835/0_298_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95254a88de1c919cf95431c9c3fbe584","title":"venezuela brazil border aid live news latest updates","story":"“The events of today oblige me to take a decision – to propose formally to the international community that we should keep open all options for the liberation of our homeland, which is fighting and will continue to fight.

The Argentine Government renews its support to the president-in-charge Juan Guaidó and the support to the efforts that it carries out together with the National Assembly to allow the entry of food and medicines destined to alleviate the suffering that the policies of the Maduro regime have imposed on all Venezuelan people.The Argentine president, Mauricio Macri, has tweeted in support of Juan Guaidó.“The situation in which Venezuelans live is dramatic,” wrote Macri. “I want to condemn the repression deployed by Maduro and his actions to prevent the Venezuelan people from receiving humanitarian aid.”Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has been tweeting a lot over the last hour, condemning the actions of Maduro, whom Pompeo called a “sick tyrant”.Pompeo accused Maduro of sending gangs of armed thugs out to attack innocent people, adding that the images of burning trucks of aid are “sickening”.Here are those tweets:Venezuelan new channel, VPI TV, have this footage, which they say is of a member of the National Guard who defected tonight.In the footage the man claims he was given orders to “massacre the people” and that Maduro released prisoners from jails to carry out attacks against the people today.This is the first we’re hearing of claims like this and the  will be seeking to verify them.Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said he will meet US Vice President Mike Pence at a meeting Monday of regional diplomats. The emergency meeting of foreign ministers from the so-called Lima Group of mostly conservative Latin American nations was organized to discuss Venezuela’s crisis. It will take place in Colombia’s capital of Bogota.Guaido, whom the US and some 50 nations recognize as Venezuela’s rightful leader, spoke from Colombian city of Cucuta alongside Colombian President Ivan Duque after a day of deadly clashes with security forces blocking the entry of humanitarian aid amassed on three of Venezuela’s borders.While insisting he wouldn’t give up in his fight to deliver the aid, he didn’t ask supporters to continue risking their lives and make another attempt to break the barricades set up by President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government.But he did make one more appeal to troops to join the opposition’s fight for power.“How many of you national guardsmen have a sick mother? How many have kids in school without food,” he said, standing alongside a warehouse where some 200 tons of mostly US-supplied boxes of food and medicine has been stockpiled.The secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, has been speaking. He calls what has been going on in Venezuela “the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life”.Venezuelan journalist Gabriel Bastidas has this translation:“While the regime denies aid, children and sick are still dying. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life. Violent killing and injuring people who moved medicine boxes.“It demonstrated the savagery and barbarity with which the regime acted to prevent the entry of humanitarian aid. The international community must absolutely respond.”He also praised those border guards who abandoned their posts and fled into Colombia, saying:“We particularly value the military who have joined in recognizing Guaidó. That will be essential to regaining democracy.”Opposition leader Juan Guaidó will be meeting with the Lima Group, which was established in 2017 to find a peaceful end to the Venezuelan crisis, on Monday. Joining them will be US vice-president Mike Pence.Speaking at the joint press conference now, opposition leader Juan Guaidó says the military does not owe loyalty to regime that would burn food in front of hungry people.Guaidó says he will participate in Group of Lima meeting in Bogota on Monday to try and resolve the situation.Venezuealan journalist Gabriel Bastidas has this translation of sections of the Colombian president’s speech. We’re working on getting you the full text of his, as well as Guaidó’s speech.“Today we saw how thousands of citizens mobilized to serve their brethren,” said Iván Duque Márquez, the president of Colombia.“We have seen the repression sought by all mechanisms to prevent humanitarian aid. This is the opportunity for the whole world to tell the dictator that it is enough, that the end of oppression has come.”“Faced with the barbaric events that occurred, I asked the Venezuelan volunteers to collect the trucks so as not to expose them to more aggression and to protect the aid.“Today the world witnessed dozens of Venezuelan soldiers crossing the border to offer their allegiance to President Guaidó.”He says that on Monday there will be a meeting to. discuss a way forward to end the impasse.“Today the dictatorship has sealed its moral and diplomatic defeat. It has become clear to the world that as much violence as they try, Venezuela will regain freedom with the strength of ideas and the mobilization of the country.”The joint press conference held by the president of Colombia, Iván Duque Márquez, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has begun. Watch live here.Maduro has posted a video of himself driving through the streets of Caracas, we he describes as “calm” and “quiet”. “Crossing the streets of Caracas – calm, quiet,” tweeted the president. “I send my greetings and I thank the people of New York for their active solidarity, expressed in the streets, with Venezuela. Peace will prevail!”He thanks those in New York who participated in solidarity protests on Saturday, in which protesters urged the US government to stay out of Venezuela and lift sanctions against the country.Opposition leader Juan Guaidó will be giving a press conference in about 20 minutes, alongside the president of Colombia and the secretary general of the Organization of American States. “I ask you all to be attentive,” he says.Hello everyone, this is Kate Lyons taking over the blog from Vivian Ho. Thanks for following along.After a day of violence across Venezuela’s border regions in which at least four people were killed, dozens injured, 60 border guards fled into Colombia seeking asylum, and three aid trucks were burned, the country finds itself at something of a stalemate. Aid still has not reached the people of Venezuela and while the number of border guards leaving their posts has continued to rise through the day, there has not been the mass defection that might have indicated a significant shift in the allegiance of the military.Neither President Nicolas Maduro nor opposition leader Juan Guaidó are backing down. Maduro, who appeared at a rally early today, has just shared a video showing his supporters marching in the streets in Caracas, remaking on the “impressive force of the people”. Whereas Guaidó has vowed to “stay in the streets until we win our freedom.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says Brexit could not be tackled with \u0026lsquopolitics as usual\u0026rsquoParty chairman and vice-chair step down in protest over its response to claims about candidateBumper prize is the biggest national lottery payout in two yearsYoung girl was trapped underwater after hair became tangled in vessel\u0026rsquos outriggersSDLP leader echoes Donald Tusk in criticism of Sinn F\u0026eacutein at Fianna F\u0026aacuteil ArdfheisMinister for Health urged to intervene to ensure Philomena Canning gets treatmentMiche\u0026aacutel Martin says deal with Fine Gael not an issue in terms of his leadershipFF ardfheis hears call for minimum 10-year sentence for adults luring children into crimeRail services affected due to scheduled repair works on Victorian roof at Dublin PearseBrigade activity reports (BAR) list every action carried out during the Irish RevolutionJohn Lawless was not known to garda\u0026iacute for involvement in serious criminal activityBrigade activity reports of the IRA have been digitised and put onlineGeneral Se\u0026aacuten Mac Eoin was known as the \u0026lsquoBlacksmith of Ballinalee\u0026rsquoOne of James Kane\u0026rsquos orphan children is said to have cried \u0026lsquoDaddy, daddy\u0026rsquo as he was buriedCork North-Central poll topper snubs FF leader\u0026rsquos demand he stay in D\u0026aacuteilA small number of co-ops, where developments are built and run by residents, are currently building homesDriver and passenger in truck not hospitalised after Friday evening crashDaniel Mullan was brought to justice in Ireland and claims to have friends in high placesFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says he will facilitate a fourth budget under the current agreement"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3803448.1550944914!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"girl 12 in critical condition after boating accident in limerick","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFire and Search and Rescue personnel on  Shannon river this Saturday morning after a boat capsized in front of Athlunkard Boat Club. Photograph: Liam BurkePress 22A 12-year-old girl was in a critical condition in hospital on Saturday night after she was trapped under a capsized rowing boat in the river Shannon.Firefighters who discovered the boat, cut the girl’s hair to free her after it had become entangled in the boat’s outriggers, used to anchor the oars to the boat.Firefighters administered first aid to the girl and took her ashore in their boat before she was taken by ambulance to University Hospital Limerick.Three other girls all believed to be of a similar age, were in the boat at the time, and were understood to have been accompanied by a support boat.The incident unfolded around 10am at a stretch of the river known locally as the Old Salmon Weir. It is understood they had set off earlier along the Abbey River from a local boat club.The girl was expected to be transferred to Temple Street children’s hospital in Dublin for further treatment.Danny Ryan, who witnessed the incident, said he would be “forever haunted” by girl’s friends’ screams for help.Mr Ryan said: “I could hear someone screaming. I could see the boat turned over and a girl waving and screaming. I could hear them calling the girl’s name, they kept calling for her.”“I couldn’t go to work. My stomach is sick over it. It was scary.”“I’m haunted all day. It’s the screams. I can still hear the girls screaming, ‘help, help help’.”One of the girls “kept calling me, ‘help me, help me, help me’, and she was waving her hands. I ran down by the weir. I kept slipping and I was nearly going into the water.”Mr Ryan praised the quick response of firefighters who were joined by Limerick Marine Search and Rescue Service, the Shannon-based Coast Guard Rescue Helicopter, and local gardaí.His wife Susan, who also saw the incident said: “I was roaring over to them that help was on the way”. She said one of the girls “screamed” at her to help.A Garda investigation is under way. Part of the investigation will aim to determine whether the girls were wearing or had flotation devices in the boat."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3803605.1550957486!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one lucky winner of 10m lotto jackpot","story":"There was one winner of the €10 million Lotto jackpot on Saturday night.The winning numbers were 3, 19, 21, 29, 31,and 35 with the bonus number 22.It is the largest prize in two years.The bumper win follows an Irish EuroMillions success earlier this week.

FIle photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The The Social Democrats party is in crisis after its party chairman and vice-chair resigned in protest over the controversy surrounding local election candidate Ellie Kisyombe.The executive board members Joe O’Connor and Carly Bailey resigned after the party decided to conduct a “review” of Ms Kisyombe’s story.It is understood that the national executive vote on the review was 9-2 in favour of carrying it out.A report in last week’s Sunday Times alleged that Ms Kisyombe, who is seeking a place on Dublin City Council in the May election, had arrived in Ireland later than she had stated in media interviews.Ms Kisyombe is originally from Malawi and has spoken of her experience of living in the direct provision system for much of the last decade.A spokesman for the Social Democrats confirmed “with regret” that the resignations had taken place. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the party said: “The co-leaders wrote to the national executive and expressed concern at the allegation that there may be some inaccuracies in Ellie’s back story, while also appreciating the complexities and severe difficulties posed for those caught up in the asylum process. As a result, the national executive subsequently met and has decided to carry out a review to work through this with Ellie.”Kildare North TD Catherine Murphy and Dublin North West TD Róisín Shortall are the co-leaders of the party.Ms Kisyombe remained a candidate on Saturday evening, the party said.MisgivingsAn email from party chairman Mr O’Connor, seen by The , states that he has decided to “step aside as party chairperson with immediate effect”.It is understood that grave misgivings had emerged at party leadership level over Ms Kisyombe’s story, and the fact that she had been advised by her lawyers not to answer questions about her immigration history.A clear conflict has emerged between members of the executive board over the path to be taken, emails seen by The  show.“This is not something which I take lightly, and it is a situation that I have been desperately hoping could be avoided over the past week,” Mr O’Connor wrote.“However, I cannot stand over the decision made by the national executive last night, or how the party intends to proceed from here.“I believe we have been forced to view this issue through a narrow lens, and as a result seem intent on pursuing a course of action which I believe is wholly inconsistent with the interpretation of a majority of our members and supporters, and will as a result inflict irreparable damage to the party in my view.”Mr O’Connor wrote that alternatives to the course of action chosen by the Social Democrats were and are available, “if our response to this issue had not been framed with a pre-determined outcome from the start”.He wrote that his “direct experience with how we approached the issue is one which I cannot accept”.“Over the past couple of weeks, I also believe irreconcilable gaps have emerged between party officers and leaders on how the party exercise good governance and due process for elections,” he wrote.He concludes by stating that “it may be too late but I would urge the party leadership to consider changing course, for the sake of our candidates and the party’s continued survival”.Fundamentally disagreesMs Bailey, who is vice-chair of the party and a general election candidate for the party in Dublin South-West has also resigned her position on the executive board. In her resignation letter, she makes clear that she fundamentally disagrees with a decision taken by the party leadership to issue a statement regarding the issue to the Sunday Times in tomorrow’s edition.She says that he “cannot stand over a decision which includes a statement that will go to the media, which in effect could and will be construed as the party essentially abandoning a candidate and especially one so vulnerable as a person living in direct provision”.“I have tried to work with everyone to find a resolution to this. I am as aware as anyone how critical this has been to us as a party. I am very disappointed that both Róisin and Catherine are of the opinion that the national executive has failed in its duties to do so this week, given the number of hours many of us have put in to try and find a way through this.“I joined this party in the belief that the Social Democrats were different. I cannot describe how devastated and disappointed I am that we have ended up here.”She writes that she “cannot stand over effectively what feels like appeasing the opinions of political correspondents over that of many of the members of the national executive, our candidates, our members and our supporters”.“It is also clear to me that the leaders remain convinced that Ellie is unviable as a candidate. Upon reflection this morning, I cannot see how this matter can be reconciled with such polarising views.”She concludes with the hope that “the party remains intact”.Major isionThe issue has caused major ision within the party, with the Dublin Central branch on Saturday evening contacting members to affirm its support for Ms Kisyombe.An email sent to party members said: “The Dublin Central branch of the Social Democrats have today reiterated their full support for their selected candidate for the North Inner City Ward in the 2019 Local Elections, Ellie Kisyombe.”“For legal reasons Ellie was, and remains unable to speak about her application, or any issues that have been raised in the Sunday edition of a national newspaper.“This places Ellie in an extremely complex situation, but she looks forward to being able to clear her name once leave to remain has been granted.“We also extend our sincerest thanks to our colleagues Joe O’Connor, Carly Bailey and the members of our party’s National Executive who’ve demonstrated immense leadership in preserving the values upon which our party was founded.“Dublin Central Social Democrats remain dedicated to supporting our friend Ellie Kisyombe’s candidacy, alongside Carol Deans, for local election and would be both honoured and proud to have such fine candidates represent the North Inner City, as new and erse voices for transformative politics.”Mr O’Connor said that he did not wish to make any comment at present. Efforts to contact Ms Bailey were unsuccessful."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3803496.1550937270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pope francis describes feminism as machismo with a skirt","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPope Francis attending the third day of a summit at the Vatican on sex abuse in the Catholic Church. Photograph: AFPVatican media Pope Francis has described feminism as “machismo with a skirt” during a brief intervention at the four-day meeting on the protection of minors in the church which is taking place at the Vatican.Meanwhile, one of the church’s leading cardinals has admitted that files on clerical child abuse have been destroyed by bishops.Pope Francis made his comment about feminism in an off-the-cuff remark after hearing an address from a woman at the meeting.“Inviting a woman to speak is not to enter into the mode of an ecclesiastical feminism, because in the end every feminism ends up being a machismo with a skirt. No. Inviting a woman to speak about the wounds of the church is to invite the church to speak about herself, about the wounds she has,” he said.He was speaking following an address by Dr Linda Ghisoni, undersecretary for the Laity at the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Laity, Family, and Life and one of three women among 12 speakers scheduled to give addresses to the 190 Catholic church leaders in attendance at the meeting.The church leaders include 10 other women. Ireland is being represented at the meeting by the president of the Irish Episcopal Conference, Archbishop Eamon Martin.In her address, Dr Ghisoni recalled how “a priest, a few days ago, exclaimed ‘Still? We continue talking about abuse! The church’s attention to this theme is exaggerated’.”She continued how “even a practicing lady told me candidly: ‘It is better not to talk about these matters, otherwise there will be distrust of the church. Talking about it obscures all the good done in the parishes’.”Referring to priests who sexually abuse children as “howling wolves that penetrate the fold to scare further and disperse the flock” she said that “becoming aware of the phenomenon and (to) understand one’s responsibility is not a fixation”.Destroyed filesIn his address to the meeting on Saturday, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, President of the German Bishops’ Conference and a member of the Council of Cardinals which advises Pope Francis, said clerical child sex abuse files have been destroyed in some dioceses.“Files that could have documented the terrible deeds and named those responsible were destroyed, or not even created. Instead of the perpetrators, the victims were regulated and silence imposed on them.”He said the “rights of victims were effectively trampled underfoot, and left to the whims of iniduals”.“These are all events that sharply contradict what the church should stand for,” he said.At a press conference in the Vatican this afternoon he was talking about the German Catholic Church and that this destruction of documents had been established in a 2014 study conducted there. He said he assumed “Germany is not an isolated case”.In his address to the meeting, he said “establishing transparent procedural norms and rules for ecclesiastical processes is essential. Institutional mistrust leads to conspiracy theories regarding an organisation, and the formation of myths about an organisation. This can be avoided if the facts are set out transparently.”‘Mediocrity and hypocrisy’In another address on Saturday, Sr Veronica Openibo, a Nigerian who has worked in Africa, Europe and the United States, berated the bishops for mistakes in handling the sexual abuse crisis, saying the church had to acknowledge its “mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency”.“We proclaim the Ten Commandments and parade ourselves as being the custodians of moral standards and values and good behaviour in society. Hypocrites at times? Yes! Why did we keep silent for so long?” she said.She told Pope Francis, sitting near her on the dais, that she admired him because he was “humble enough to change your mind”, apologise and take action after he initially defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse. The bishop later resigned.“How could the clerical church have kept silent, covering these atrocities? The silence, the carrying of the secrets in the hearts of the perpetrators, the length of the abuses and the constant transfers of perpetrators are unimaginable,” she said.‘Crisis and shame’She spoke of her shock when she watched the 2015 Oscar-winning film Spotlight, which uncovered how church leaders in Boston moved predator priests from parish to parish instead of defrocking them or turning them over to civil authorities.“At the present time, we are in a state of crisis and shame. We have seriously clouded the grace of the Christ-mission,” Sr Openibo said.“We must acknowledge that our mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency have brought us to this disgraceful and scandalous place we find ourselves as a church. We pause to pray, Lord have mercy on us!” she said.She said church leaders must shed their habit of hiding events for fear of making a mistake.“Too often we want to keep silent until the storm has passed. This storm will not pass by. Our credibility is at stake,” she said.Leading cardinals told the four-day conference on Friday that the church must repair the “systematic failures” that enabled sexual abuse to take root around the world, and bishops should start policing each other’s behaviour.At the start of the conference on Thursday, five victims told painful stories of abuse and cover-up and the pope said they could expect concrete measures to come out of the meeting.Victims groups have complained that while some priests who sexually abused children were eventually disciplined by the church and sentenced by civil authorities, the bishops who either enabled the abuse or covered it up have not been punished.The conference ends on Sunday when the pope will make a final speech. The Vatican says it will then formulate follow-up measures to make sure all bishop return home knowing how to put anti-abuse procedures into place. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

To many, Hyndman says, this is seen as simply “trying too hard.”  And Anders Godal, design director and partner at The Creators Club, said: People’s perception of luxury has changed drastically over the last few years. It seems the trend nowadays is leaning more towards the understated and simple, whereas in the past things were designed to stand out as luxurious – so the trend towards more simplified typography is a natural progression.For example, when we work with clients who would like more of a high-end or luxurious feel to their brand it’s more down to the details, like choice of materials and finishes and not so much leaning on a fancy font.  Retail and Consumer industryVenezuelan soldiers set fire to aid convoys at Colombia border as two killed in clashesKim Jong-un heads to Vietnam by train ahead of Trump summitChildren in secondary school to be taught about female genital mutilation Tories are not party of \u0026#39purges and retribution\u0026#39 and should resist attempts to deselect MPs, Theresa May saysCargo jet with three on board crashes near Houston airportOne of Labour\u0026#39s biggest private backers has donated to The Independent GroupHS2 predicted noise levels would breach new World Health Organisation limitsComment: Taking no deal off the table could torpedo Brexit completelyBrexit delay \u0026#39an elephant trap that we can\u0026#39t escape\u0026#39, senior ministers warnBack to business for Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they touch down in Morocco Detective forced out by Met after dismissing VIP sex abuse as \u0026#34witch hunt\u0026#34 hits out at decision to exclude him from inquiryMother\u0026#39s plea for news of daughter who went missing after attending fringe church serviceComment: The Remainer rebels plotting to cripple the PM next week need to step back from the brinkFacebook has failed to do enough to stop harmful anti-vaccination posts, says shadow health secretary Shamima Begum says UK government is \u0026#39making an example of me\u0026#39\u0026#39Catfishing\u0026#39 con catches out Nato troops, report revealsPagans give stamp of approval to Royal Mail\u0026#39s celebration of one of their godsComment: Shamima Begum is the product of a country that no longer believes in itselfHizbollah to be banned by UK Government as soon as this weekR Kelly\u0026#39s met minor he allegedly had sex with \u0026#39during porn trial\u0026#39 court hears as judge sets $1 million bondWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/26/TELEMMGLPICT000132278850_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"catfishing con catches nato troops report reveals","story":"Some Nato troops have been \u0026#39snared\u0026#39 in an operation to see how social media can be used to glean key information from themMinistry of DefenceNato troops have been persuaded to abandon their posts and reveal sensitive details about military manoeuvres in a clandestine social media operation launched by their own side.More than 150 soldiers were snared in the so-called catfishing trap which used Facebook and Instagram to manipulate them.A secret \u0027red team based at Nato\u0027s Stratcom Centre of Excellence in Latvia targeted the unwitting troops as they took part in a scheduled military exercise in an Allied country.While it remained unclear on Saturday  night whether any British servicemen or women were targeted in the operation, British military and cyber experts warned that the report was a worrying development.Stratcom’s report did not reveal which of the 29 Nato countries was subject to the test. However, the report has been presented to Congress in Washington.It detailed how operatives set up fake social media pages, luring soldiers into closed Facebook groups, where fake accounts then asked them sensitive questions about the military exercise they were involved with.\u0026#34Catfishing\u0026#34 involves tricksters setting up fake social media accounts The operatives were able to obtain information from the soldiers including locating battalions, and tracking troop movements.They even got hold of material that could have been used for blackmail, such as finding married soldiers who used dating sites, and persuaded some to engage in undesirable behaviour like leaving their positions.For a month Stratcom carried out the project, which also showed how slow Facebook was to shut down fake pages.The entire operation cost just $60, demonstrating how easy it would be for Russian agents to do something similar.Nato officials said a decision to launch the secret study was taken in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s appearance before Congress last April, which highlighted how easily iniduals\u0027 data could be harvested.The level of personal information we found was very detailed and enabled us to instill undesirable behaviour during the exercise.”The report noted how slow Facebook was in removing fake profilesInstagram was found to be a valuable source of time sensitive information, and Facebook\u0027s suggested friends function was highly useful in identifying other soldiers taking part in the exercise.Stratcom obtained personal phone numbers and email addresses for soldiers in high value units, and photographs of their equipment.The social media companies had varying degrees of success tackling the operatives, with some fake profiles and Facebook groups never closed down.The report concluded social media being used to gather mission-sensitive information would be a significant challenge for years to come.Lord West, the retired Royal Navy senior officer who was a security advisor to former prime minister Gordon Brown, said he hoped servicemen and women would know the perils of loose talk online.“Clearly one always has to be aware online who exactly you’re speaking to. People should be very clear in the military that there are certain things you don’t talk about online even to friends, let alone people you don’t know.“Things that are clearly important, such as your location, what you’re doing, what your job is and leaving your post to meet people you’ve met online would be certainly wrong.“I think people historically have always been a bit silly when it comes to an attractive girl or an attractive bloke. I’m afraid people sometimes don’t get led by their brains, but there’s no excuse for it and it’s quite clear how they should be behave.”Danni Brooke, a former undercover officer for the politan Police and cyber security specialist, said: “We live our lives online. We leave a trail on different social media platforms that can help people build up a clear picture of who we are. Consequently this can be used to establish who someone is and even how to manipulate them.”Last month it emerged Pakistani intelligence agents have been adopting attractive female social media personas to catfish Indian soldiers, inducing them to ulge operational information.Dozens of Indian soldiers were found to have been in contact with a Pakistani agent who was posing on social media as an Indian Army nurse.Ministry of DefencePlease review our commenting policyVenezuelan soldiers set fire to aid convoys at Colombia border as two killed in clashesKim Jong-un heads to Vietnam by train ahead of Trump summitChildren in secondary school to be taught about female genital mutilation Tories are not party of \u0026#39purges and retribution\u0026#39 and should resist attempts to deselect MPs, Theresa May saysCargo jet with three on board crashes near Houston airportOne of Labour\u0026#39s biggest private backers has donated to The Independent GroupHS2 predicted noise levels would breach new World Health Organisation limitsComment: Taking no deal off the table could torpedo Brexit completelyBrexit delay \u0026#39an elephant trap that we can\u0026#39t escape\u0026#39, senior ministers warnBack to business for Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they touch down in Morocco Detective forced out by Met after dismissing VIP sex abuse as \u0026#34witch hunt\u0026#34 hits out at decision to exclude him from inquiryMother\u0026#39s plea for news of daughter who went missing after attending fringe church serviceComment: The Remainer rebels plotting to cripple the PM next week need to step back from the brinkFacebook has failed to do enough to stop harmful anti-vaccination posts, says shadow health secretary Shamima Begum says UK government is \u0026#39making an example of me\u0026#39Pagans give stamp of approval to Royal Mail\u0026#39s celebration of one of their godsComment: Shamima Begum is the product of a country that no longer believes in itselfHizbollah to be banned by UK Government as soon as this weekR Kelly\u0026#39s met minor he allegedly had sex with \u0026#39during porn trial\u0026#39 court hears as judge sets $1 million bondWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/23/TELEMMGLPICT000188945134_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqI-gJgSO5jsZabrCjPyvwDQOQ_9C9KzW8elui7cMQnEk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"pagans give stamp approval royal mails celebration one gods","story":"There cannot be that many things in national life to celebrate for those who still worship the Norse gods.Pagan druids and their followers might gather at Stonehenge every solstice, but there is no special national holiday to celebrate either Odin and those who live with him in Asgard, the home of the gods.But now, after years of being ignored, the Odinists and those who still look to Norse mythology for inspiration and guidance, have finally got something to smile about.The Royal Mail is to issue a ‘pagan’ stamp next month, depicting the Norse god Thor, the hammer wielding god of thunder and protector of mankind.Admittedly it forms part of a set of stamps commemorating Marvel Comics superheroes - of whom Thor is one, enjoying his own comic series and film spin offs - rather than the original figure of Germanic mythology.But the Odinist Fellowship are pretty pleased all the same.They are a registered charity that exists to promote the original old religion of the English people and the native faith of the northern lands, so they naturally welcome any celebration of Norse mythology.Thor\u0026#39s Fight with the Giants by Marten Eskil Winge, 1872Ralph Harrison, the director of the Odinist Fellowship, said: Considering how the Christian church tried so hard to eliminate the images of the Gods, it is with some satisfaction that we will be seeing people of all religions and none, who use this stamp, acknowledging, in a small way, the God Thor\u0027s continued presence in our nation\u0027s cultural life.The Odinists - who worship at a Grade II listed former almshouse in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, dating back to the Tudor period - are so pleased they aren’t even complaining that the Thor shown in the stamps is the one created by an American comic publisher rather than the traditional depiction of him.He’s still their man (or god), they say.Mr Harrison said: We recognise that the Marvel Comic depiction of Thor differs somewhat in its iconography from descriptions given in ancient sources, such as the Eddas but Marvel seem to have based their image on that of Marten Eskil Winge\u0027s famous painting, ‘Thor Fights the Giants’, now on display in the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm.”The fellowship points out that under the terms of the Postal Services Act 2011 the design of all British postage stamps must be approved by the Queen, and this is the first time that the Monarch has approved a design depicting one of the Gods of pre-Christian northern Europe on a stamp.The Royal Mail has been previously criticised its choice of imagery for stamps.The Royal Mail is to issue a ‘pagan’ stamp next month, depicting the Norse god ThorIt was attacked by Boris Johnson last year for not issuing a commemorative set of stamps to mark Brexit and in 2008 its decision to include the family planning pioneer Marie Stopes in a set commemorating women’s achievement was criticised by those who accuse of her being a eugenicist and Nazi sympathiser.But on this occasion even the Church of England, of whom the Queen is the head and Supreme Governor, appears to have no complaint about the choice of a pagan god for a set of stamps carrying her mail.Asked to comment the Church of England declined.The Royal Mail said the series depicting Thor and other Marvel superheroes, including Spiderman and Black Panther, celebrated the impact of the comics in Britain and the contribution made to their distinctive look by British artists and designers.A Royal Mail spokeswoman said: “The Marvel Comics stories have been enjoyed for decades by generations of UK fans, and in the 1970s Marvel launched a UK imprint of its comics.“The 1980s, in particular, saw US comic publishers heavily recruiting British writers and illustrators, who increasingly worked on the American publications and began to inject darker storylines and widened the appeal of the characters. One such artist is Alan Davis, who designed the new Special Stamps, and has worked with Marvel since the early 1980s and first illustrated Captain Britain in 1985.”Please review our commenting policyVenezuelan soldiers set fire to aid convoys at Colombia border as two killed in clashesKim Jong-un heads to Vietnam by train ahead of Trump summitChildren in secondary school to be taught about female genital mutilation Tories are not party of \u0026#39purges and retribution\u0026#39 and should resist attempts to deselect MPs, Theresa May saysCargo jet with three on board crashes near Houston airportOne of Labour\u0026#39s biggest private backers has donated to The Independent GroupHS2 predicted noise levels would breach new World Health Organisation limitsComment: Taking no deal off the table could torpedo Brexit completelyBrexit delay \u0026#39an elephant trap that we can\u0026#39t escape\u0026#39, senior ministers warnBack to business for Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they touch down in Morocco Detective forced out by Met after dismissing VIP sex abuse as \u0026#34witch hunt\u0026#34 hits out at decision to exclude him from inquiryMother\u0026#39s plea for news of daughter who went missing after attending fringe church serviceComment: The Remainer rebels plotting to cripple the PM next week need to step back from the brinkFacebook has failed to do enough to stop harmful anti-vaccination posts, says shadow health secretary \u0026#39Catfishing\u0026#39 con catches out Nato troops, report revealsShamima Begum says UK government is \u0026#39making an example of me\u0026#39Comment: Shamima Begum is the product of a country that no longer believes in itselfHizbollah to be banned by UK Government as soon as this weekR Kelly\u0026#39s met minor he allegedly had sex with \u0026#39during porn trial\u0026#39 court hears as judge sets $1 million bondWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 23 february 2019","story":"Farmer Gilles Druet flanked by the 2019 fair\u0027s muse cow, Imminence, arrive at the International Agriculture Fair in Paris.Venezuelan soldiers set fire to aid convoys at Colombia border as two killed in clashesKim Jong-un heads to Vietnam by train ahead of Trump summitChildren in secondary school to be taught about female genital mutilation Tories are not party of \u0026#39purges and retribution\u0026#39 and should resist attempts to deselect MPs, Theresa May saysCargo jet with three on board crashes near Houston airportOne of Labour\u0026#39s biggest private backers has donated to The Independent GroupHS2 predicted noise levels would breach new World Health Organisation limitsComment: Taking no deal off the table could torpedo Brexit completelyBrexit delay \u0026#39an elephant trap that we can\u0026#39t escape\u0026#39, senior ministers warnBack to business for Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they touch down in Morocco Detective forced out by Met after dismissing VIP sex abuse as \u0026#34witch hunt\u0026#34 hits out at decision to exclude him from inquiryMother\u0026#39s plea for news of daughter who went missing after attending fringe church serviceComment: The Remainer rebels plotting to cripple the PM next week need to step back from the brinkFacebook has failed to do enough to stop harmful anti-vaccination posts, says shadow health secretary Shamima Begum says UK government is \u0026#39making an example of me\u0026#39\u0026#39Catfishing\u0026#39 con catches out Nato troops, report revealsPagans give stamp of approval to Royal Mail\u0026#39s celebration of one of their godsComment: Shamima Begum is the product of a country that no longer believes in itselfHizbollah to be banned by UK Government as soon as this weekWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/23/TELEMMGLPICT000189280450_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"shamima begam says uk government making example abandoned fate","story":"Begum said no British officials had contacted her in the camp to notify her of the stripping of her citizenshipIsil bride Shamima Begum has accused the British government of “making an example of her by stripping her of UK citizenship, but admits she now regrets speaking out about her situation.Speaking to The Sunday  in the al-Hol camp in Syria, the 19-year-old from east London said she might have been able to keep her UK passport if her case had not attracted so much attention.They are making an example of me, she said.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no.

Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHShe added: “In fact that’s why I\u0026nbspsat down with him in the first place. I\u0026nbspsaw an opportunity to pick someone so opposite’s brain and try to talk some sense into them which i understand is highly unlikely but I\u0026nbspwill not apologise for trying. That’s all.”Grande said in a follow-up message she was “anything but complacent” during her conversation with Morgan, adding: “I\u0026nbspwon’t stop having conversations with people I\u0026nbspdisagree with when I\u0026nbspsee the opportunity to.”Morgan shared a photo of himself with Grande earlier this week on Twitter, saying they had spoken for about two hours.“We laughed, we argued, she cried, I nearly did, the drinks flowed and\u0026nbspwe bonded,” he wrote. “Turns out we really like each other. Weird.”The message left some Twitter users baffled, including one person who wrote: “Ew Ariana why.”Someone else tweeted: “ARIANA NO,” while another person wrote: “Don’t like this.”In addition to their spat over Little Mix, Morgan criticised Grande after the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing for not immediately visiting the victims of the attack. He apologised after Grande held the One Love Manchester concert, saying he had misjudged her.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But might history actually be on the side of the new movement, asks Adam LusherClick to followThe IndependentMarkus Keaney, local Labour chair, says Shuker would be annihilated in a by-electionIt’s not every day you get to rock a flat cap and give a Trotsky turn of phrase to the BBC News from Luton.\u0026nbspBut Markus Keaney, chair of Luton South Constituency Labour Party, managed it all this week, when\u0026nbsphe discussed his recently departed ex-comrade Gavin Shuker, the constituency’s MP.Keaney looked forward to the day when the defector to the Independent Group would be “consigned to the dustbin of history” and\u0026nbsp“annihilated” by an official Labour candidate at a by-election.\u0026nbspHis words were uttered\u0026nbspwith the cold rage of a man who knows his local party committee procedure and is prepared to use it in the cause of “passionate new members enthused by the promise of a break from neoliberalism” – as he described the post-Jeremy Corbyn intake in his September\u0026nbspMorning Star article, written after a\u0026nbspno-confidence vote taken by party members against\u0026nbspShuker was carried.But, to refer to the context in which Trotsky popularised the “dustbin of history” line, who here were the doomed Mensheviks, and who the 1917 Bolsheviks arising to greet the new post-Capitalist dawn?\u0026nbspAs the Independent Group went cross-party with the arrival of three defecting Conservatives, were we witnessing the start of something like Emmanuel Macron’s French En Marche!\u0026nbspmovement? Or would Keaney still get his annihilation moment?\u0026nbspShuker and the Labour splitCould it be the Corbyn project that is doomed?\u0026nbspPerhaps lessons could be learned in Luton, a town with some claim to being a bit of a bellwether.\u0026nbspUntil\u0026nbspShuker upset the trend by getting elected for Labour in 2010, the Luton South constituency had gone to the party that won the general election in every contest since 1951.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

You never change things from the outside. He should stand his ground and try to f***ing sort it from inside.”There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it? But I am a born optimistAnd yet. The more you spoke to Gallagher, and his workmates, and others, the more you sensed a certain sympathy for Shuker and the points he was making about “abuse” in the party, about failure to oppose hard Brexit, and about Jeremy Corbyn.Painter and decorator John Brydson, 68, initially described himself as a Tory-voting Brexit supporter. But it turned out the backstory was more tangled, in ways that might favour Shuker, not Corbyn. “I was Labour for 50 years,” said Brydson.\u0026nbsp“But when Corbyn came in, I changed to Tory.\u0026nbspThere will never be a Labour government while he is at the head of the Labour Party.”Shuker was one of seven Labour members to quit the party on Monday\u0026nbsp(PA)He too didn’t like the way Shuker had left the party. “But yeah, I would vote for him, even though the way he went about it was wrong.”There was a moment of reflection when you mentioned\u0026nbspKeaney’s prediction that a by-election would see Shuker “annihilated” by an official Labour candidate.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think so,” said Mr Brydson softly.MPs: Joan Ryan,\u0026nbspHeidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston (Reuters)Gallagher, meanwhile, seemed to be moving a long way in a short discussion, from “absolute rubbish” to “fair play to him”.\u0026nbspHe was an unwavering Labour man, he insisted: “All my life, working-class, always vote Labour.”But when you put him on the spot, and ask\u0026nbsphim to pick sides in a by-election fight between Shuker and a Keaney-approved Corbyn Labour candidate, there was a long pause.\u0026nbsp“Christ, you would have to go with Shuker, wouldn’t you?\u0026nbspYou would have to go sensible. The bloke with the cap, a proper lefty, wasn’t he?\u0026nbspToo much hatred in his voice, I thought.”The more ardent anti-neoliberal Corbynistas may not wish to be reminded of the old aphorism that the Labour Party owes more to Methodism than Marxism.\u0026nbspBut it was impossible to ignore as you sat in the Hardware Cafe\u0026nbspand pondered the new battle for the soul of British politics.\u0026nbspThe view from the cafe windows was dominated by the Mount Tabor Primitive Methodist Chapel, built 1897, grandeur unfaded, the names of the Victorian worthies who supported the project carved in stone for all to see.\u0026nbspMethodism still seemed to be triumphing over Marxism in 2019.\u0026nbspAl Short, 51, social worker and Christian, arrived.\u0026nbspHe still believed in the ideals of 2015, when Corbyn was promising a “kinder, gentler politics”. He regarded the Labour leader as “a pretty principled, genuine kind of guy, who cares for the poor, offers a genuine alternative.”And yet in a very gentle, very Christian kind of way, and despite his vote for Brexit, Short seemed to be warming to Shuker and this new Independent Group.\u0026nbsp“I am a Christian.\u0026nbspGavin Shuker is a Christian. I have a sense of rapport with him.”He even went as far as hoping the gang of 11\u0026nbsp(and counting) could prove a more successful update of the Gang of Four, who for a brief 1980s flurry had\u0026nbsplooked as if they might reshape British politics by leaving Labour and forming the SDP.Shuker (right) with his colleagues announcing their breakaway\u0026nbsp(PA)Short smiled, as if imagining a mildly exciting future: “There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it?\u0026nbspBut I am a born optimist.”Shuker will face an altogether feistier proposition in Short’s support-worker colleague Lorna Calliste, 42, east London-born daughter of a Trinidadian mother, now a mum to four kids by an Irish builder, and a committed Brexit supporter.\u0026nbsp“No, no, no,” was the unequivocal response to Shuker’s talk of taking a stand against “hard Tory Brexit”.But if Calliste wasn’t exactly brimming with excitement for Shuker and the Independent Group, she didn’t seem a natural fit with\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Labour either.\u0026nbsp“Labour has\u0026nbspgone silly.\u0026nbspThey want to let everyone in the country.\u0026nbspWhy can’t we have an Australian system where we let someone in if they have something to offer?”In the Hardware Cafe, you began to sense that going against his constituency’s Brexit vote would not fatally undermine Shuker, and that, however fuzzily, other elements of what the Independent Group was saying had hit home.Luciana Berger’s message was remembered, even if her name wasn’t (PA)Luciana Berger may exist in the Luton South consciousness as “the lady with the dark hair”, but many agreed with her that “what’s happening with the antisemitism is disgusting”.\u0026nbspAnd the notion that politics is “broken” sold itself.Stephen McNeilly had been excited by politics, once.\u0026nbspNow the 39-year-old electrician placed himself firmly in the camp of “the name Gavin Shuker rings a bell”.\u0026nbspHis disillusion with politics was a badge of pride, enlivened by references to Corbyn as “an absolute plank” to Brexit as a “f***ing shambles” to former Luton South MP Margaret Moran, whose life fell apart when she was caught “fiddling her expenses”.My son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a tryAnd yet, in almost the same lament, McNeilly seemed to be crying out for someone to inspire him and all the others languishing in the ranks of the disillusioned.\u0026nbsp“There’s no Martin Luther King figure,” he said.\u0026nbsp“No one with fresh ideas, no one with a voice, to make people stand up and listen.”Vividly expressed disillusion began to sound a little like an open invitation to Shuker and his Independent Group – all the more so when McNeilly turned to his own, conflicted feelings about having voted Leave.MPs have left the Labour party to form independent group“Every single thing I voted for – stopping immigration first and foremost – will be made null and void.\u0026nbspWe’re going to be financially crippled, kicked in the teeth. The dreadful thing is,\u0026nbspI would want to reverse it and vote Remain.”Perhaps all the conversations seemed to be running Shuker’s way.Why the Independent Group won’t succeed without electoral reformCabinet ministers back new Independent Group, claim Tory defectorsEx-Tory MP says battle for party is over as Brexit hardliners have wonBut then, Edward, a rather thoughtful 68-year-old, looked up from his book, and wondered whether we might be seeing things through a bit of a mainstream media haze.\u0026nbsp“My son’s 29,” said Edward, “And, I think, rather fooled by Corbyn.\u0026nbspSomehow Corbyn has got into young people, by young person’s media.\u0026nbspI suppose I am a centrist dad.\u0026nbspI’m so old I remember the Labour government of the 1970s that led us into trouble, into strikes.“But my son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a try.”But do they really, still?\u0026nbspThe University of Bedfordshire’s campus offered the chance of a probably wildly unscientific straw poll of the much-discussed millennial generation.\u0026nbspIt left you wondering whether the fever of Corbyn-mania may have cooled somewhat since the heady days of the June 2017 general election.Kieran Nixon, 23, was president of the student union, but when he spoke in a personal capacity he began to sound like a lot of others on campus.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2015 because his parents did.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2017 because of genuine enthusiasm for Corbyn.\u0026nbsp“He kind of set up this persona,” said Nixon, “that he was new, fresh, ‘down with the kids’, articulate.\u0026nbspI saw him going to festivals, saying he would clear the student loan debt.“But now it just feels like it was a pipe dream.\u0026nbspI don’t think I can see him being prime minister.\u0026nbspHe seems short of ideas, too quick to pass the blame to Theresa May.\u0026nbspHe doesn’t come up with any worthwhile solution to Brexit that could get accepted by Brussels.”“Maybe,” said Nixon, recalling that summer when he was 20 months younger and Corbyn was at Glastonbury, “going to festivals doesn’t really say professionalism.”Daisie Johnson: ‘The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Corbyn opposing Brexit’ (Adam Lusher)Daisie Johnson also liked the Glastonbury appearance, at the time.\u0026nbsp“Corbyn tries to talk to young people,” said the psychology and criminal behaviour student. “Which is more than you can say for Theresa May.”But now, the full impact of the EU referendum – in which she was too young to participate – has hit home:\u0026nbsp“The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Jeremy Corbyn opposing Brexit.\u0026nbspThat doesn’t seem to come up on the news feed.\u0026nbspI’m probably more for this other guy if he is against Brexit and Corbyn isn’t.”So no,\u0026nbspJohnson didn’t know who “this other guy” Shuker was.\u0026nbspAnd she didn’t really see how the Independent Group could turn a bit of House of Commons seating rearrangement into real change.\u0026nbsp“Where’s the majority to do anything? I don’t really get it.”Soubry and Sarah Wollaston join their new honourable friends\u0026nbspin the House of Commons (PA)But nor did McNeilly really get it when we began talking, and now he was at least a little interested.\u0026nbsp“I’ll try to catch a glimpse of what he’s saying,” said the 39-year-old.\u0026nbsp“More power to the guy: a journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step.”So what if that first step will be Shuker telling us who he is? They sneered at Macron to begin with, and he made it into the Elysee, avoiding the dustbin of history.\u0026nbspKeaney might be annoyed, but perhaps Shuker can take comfort in the fact there was even a time when no one knew who Trotsky and the Bolsheviks were either.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials? Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one.

Jennifer Lopez, Awkwafina, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Brie Larson, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Amandla Stenberg, Charlize Theron, Tessa Thompson\u0026nbspand Constance Wu will be handing out the statuettes.The show is also expected to focus on\u0026nbspwhat has been a strong year for music in film, with Best Actress hopeful\u0026nbspLady Gaga down to perform “Shallow” from the third remake of\u0026nbspA Star is\u0026nbspBorn\u0026nbspwith director and co-star Bradley Cooper.Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\u0026nbspwill perform “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings” from the Coen Brothers’s The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u0026nbspand Jennifer Hudson will sing “I’ll Fight” from the documentary RBG.\u0026nbspProducer Donna Gigliotti\u0026nbspand director Glenn Weiss have meanwhile been tasked with bringing off a leaner show this time around, running under three hours for the first time since 1973.To achieve this, some of the lower-profile awards will be handed out while the broadcast is in commercial breaks, saving almost an hour after 2018’s telecast staggered on for a gruelling\u0026nbspthree hours and 53 minutes.Which films have been nominated\u0026nbspfor the top prizes?Yorgos Lanthimos’s period drama The Favourite and Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma secured 10 nominations each.Both films are have been shortlisted\u0026nbspfor the prestigious Best Picture award, along with Black Panther (a popular choice), BlacKkKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody, Green Book, A Star is Born\u0026nbspand Vice.The Oscar nominations prove change is coming – but not fast enoughThe Favourite‘s Olivia Colman is in pole position to land Best Actress for her superb performance as Queen Anne while co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will continue their ficitonal rivalry in the Best Supporting Actress category.Christian Bale is hotly-tipped to win Best Actor for his role as former vice-president Dick Cheney in Adam McKay’s satire while the Best Supporting Actor category drew contrasting responses from a delighted Richard E Grant and a very droll Sam Elliott (“It’s about f***ing time”).The Academy has been criticised for again failing to list a female filmmaker in the Best Director category while fans of Timothee Chalamet were disappointed his performance as a drug addict in\u0026nbspFelix Van Groeningen’s Beautfiul Boy was overlooked.You can read a complete list of the nominations here\u0026nbspand an overview of the\u0026nbspbiggest talking points from the announcement here.What happened to the\u0026nbspBest Popular Film category?The new award was announced in August but withdrawn a month later on the strength of the hostile reception it received.Critics and fans argued the category would be used as a means of sidelining crowd-pleasing blockbusters like Black Panther, keeping Best Film free for the “prestige” pictures that usually dominate.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has said it “will examine and seek additional input regarding the new category” and has not ruled out its future revival.The Academy announced in June 2018 it had invited 928 new members of the filmmaking profession to join its ranks.Part of a new initiative commenced under former Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the measure is intended to address the shocking revelation in 2016 that 92 per cent of membership was white and 75 per cent male.Invitations were extended to actors including Amy Schumer, Kumail Nanjiani, Dave Chappelle, Sarah Silverman and\u0026nbspJada Pinkett Smith as well as a host technicians, directors and executives in a bid to improve ersity and offer a broader representation of opinion.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

In the current vogue for maximum screen size but minimum phone size, while noting that our hands aren\u0027t getting any bigger, a screen that can double in size was bound to come along sooner or later.And it looks like other companies like Xiaomi, Huawei, Motorola and even Apple are exploring the technology. It\u0027s made possible by flexible OLED displays. Another company, Royole, already has a phone that folds out to become a tablet.Samsung has had these flexible OLEDs for a while –\u0026nbspmost recent flagships from the company have featured them – but they\u0027re encased in solid glass, so you might not have noticed.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightIn fact the iPhone X and XS use the flexibility to remove the bezel at the bottom of the phone: Inside the iPhone, the OLED screen is bent back on itself.Of course, that was only half the answer: The display sits below another layer on a phone, usually glass. It was only when a flexible cover layer was developed that folding phones could happen.The Fold has a 4.7in screen when it\u0027s closed, looking like a regular smartphone, if a bit thicker. Then, it opens up to reveal a second screen inside, which measure 7.3-inches. To put that in context, many smaller tablets on the market boast 7-inch displays.So, how convenient, no need to carry two gadgets any more but still have the joys of the big screen. But, from seeing the new device, I have some initial reservations.First, the bigger display has a weird screen ratio. It\u0027s not quite square but at 4.2:3 is noticeably squarer than many tablets. Samsung displayed a Netflix movie on it, which looked great except that quite a lot of the screen was black bars on either side, which reduced the effect. I suspect it would have looked better on the smaller front display, where it would fill it entirely.This shape means you can display three apps at once, like a YouTube feed, Instagram and a web page. The YouTube element, even in the biggest window, only had a tiny video element, which also wasn\u0027t that appealing.These are early days, though, and there may well be a combination of apps which will work well together.Second, the display didn\u0027t look sensational. Although it opens perfectly flat and images can run across the two with no sense of a join, as the Fold tilted in the light, a straight line that looked like a crease was visible. Perhaps this was because it was an early sample and when the phone is released (26 April in the US, 3 May in Europe) this will have been sorted.Third, can it really justify the cost? In the US, the price starts at $1,980 and in Europe, $2,000. No UK price was given though expect it to be around £1,600 or more. For that money you could buy the Samsung Galaxy S10 and a 9.7in iPad and have a lot of cash left over.But you wouldn\u0027t have the convenience of the two-devices-in-one that the Galaxy Fold turns out to be.\u0026nbsp And in terms of innovation, a folding phone is the most exciting development in phone design for years.Samsung Galaxy S10: Best network deals in the UKThe other phones look rather more ordinary in comparison, but offer noticeable upgrades from the current Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ handsets.Both the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ feature a pretty exciting innovation, a fingerprint sensor buried in the display itself that\u0026nbspallows\u0026nbspthe screen to stretch across the whole of the front of the phone. Well, almost.There\u0027s a tiny punch-hole in the S10 screen, a bigger one on the S10+, where the front-facing camera (or cameras on the larger phone) sit.Samsung says that the technology it\u0027s used, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, is the most advanced around and in my brief use of it, it\u0027s very fast indeed and in a day or so\u0027s use recognised my thumbprint 100 per cent of the time –\u0026nbspa little better than rival in-screen sensors from Huawei and others.There is a downside to this tech: It won\u0027t work through thick screen protectors, so check before you buy a protector for your phone.Both cameras also adopt triple camera units on the rear with two 12-megapixel sensors offering wide and super-wide lenses. The wide lens has an automatically adjusting aperture to allow more light in when there\u0027s not much there. The third sensor, backed by a 16-megapixel sensor, is an ultra-wide lens with a field of view which Samsung says matches that of the human eye.The new phones also have two-way wireless charging so that you can place a friend\u0027s wireless-compatible phone against the S10 or S10+ and charge it from the Samsung. Testing it with an iPhone XS Max, it worked instantly and is a very satisfying feeling. Huawei had this feature first, but it\u0027s something every phone should have.The S10e offered some of the S10\u0027s features in a smaller form, so every hand size may find something that fits. But you\u0027ll need big mitts to encompass the final phone release of the evening, the S10 5G. The difference here is, can you guess, it works on 5G networks. It\u0027ll be released in May and has a 6.7in display, the biggest Galaxy S phone yet.The Fold on its own puts Samsung out there when it comes to innovation, but the new Galaxy S10 range –\u0026nbspyou know, the ones most of us will consider buying –\u0026nbspoffer enough choice and a big step forward from last year\u0027s S9 range. The addition of the super-cool inscreen fingerprint sensor on the S10 and S10+ along with the new triple cameras will be enough to tempt many.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within an hour of liftoff, Beresheet was already sending back data and had successfully deployed its landing legs, according to SpaceIL.\u0026nbsp“We’ll keep analysing the data, but bottom line is we entered the very exclusive group of countries that have launched a spacecraft to the moon,” said Yigal Harel, head of SpaceIL’s spacecraft programme.\u0026nbspElon Musk’s SpaceX to have launches reviewed by PentagonElon Musk reveals price of a ticket to Mars on board SpaceX flightsPrime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was watching the launch live from the Israeli control centre in Yehud, near Tel Aviv.\u0026nbsp“This is a big step for Israel, but a giant step for Israeli technology,” he said.The four-legged Beresheet, barely the size of a washing machine, will circle Earth in ever bigger loops until it’s captured by lunar gravity and goes into orbit around the moon. Touchdown would be 11 April\u0026nbspat the Sea of Serenity.\u0026nbspNasa’s Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s took about three days to get astronauts to the moon, but they used monstrous Saturn V rockets.The $100m (£78m)\u0026nbspBeresheet mission could not\u0026nbspafford its own rocket – even a little one – so the organisers opted for a ride share. That makes for a much longer trip the moon\u0026nbspis currently nearly 230,000 miles\u0026nbspaway.\u0026nbsp“This is Uber-style space exploration, so we’re riding shotgun on the rocket,” Mr Winetraub explained at a news conference on the eve of launch.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspAir Force also has a small research spacecraft aboard the rocket, for a one-year mission in orbit around Earth.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System  Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Soviet Union was the first to put a spacecraft on the moon, Luna 2, in 1959.

Last month, China became the first country to land on the far side of the moon.\u0026nbspApollo 11 astronaut\u0026nbspBuzz Aldrin quickly offered congratulations following Thursday’s launch. So did Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine, who called it “a historic step for all nations and commercial space as we look to extend our collaborations beyond low-Earth orbit and on to the moon”.\u0026nbspNasa\u0026nbsphas a laser reflector aboard Beresheet and is offering its Deep Space Network for communication.\u0026nbsp“All the best to @TeamSpaceIL as it starts its journey tonight on a @SpaceX #Falcon9 from Florida to my old stomping ground ... the moon,” Aldrin tweeted.\u0026nbspThe Beresheet mission originally was part of the Google Lunar XPrize competition and even made the final cut before the contest ended last year without a winner. The organisers decided to press ahead on their own, with donations from billionaires as well as schoolchildren.\u0026nbspLunar surface operations are meant to last just two days. Beresheet will measure the magnetic field at the landing site, and send back data and pictures. A time capsule is aboard the lander — which includes a picture of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003 — as well as a lunar library containing 30 million pages on a disk from the US-based Arch Mission Foundation.\u0026nbspRamon’s widow, Rona, was a big supporter of Beresheet she died of cancer in December.\u0026nbspFollowing liftoff, SpaceX recovered the first-stage booster, which flew twice last year. The booster landed smoothly on an offshore ocean platform, after the hottest re-entry yet, according to SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk.

The old mobile app was perfectly fine.In the replies, many said they were not even aware of how to actually get to the missing buttons.Getting to the menu that includes shuffle is relatively simple, even if it is not at all obvious and still relatively time-consuming. To bring up the lost menu, click the three dots that are in the top right corner of the now playing page, which will bring up a whole host of other missing buttons, such as the button that will take you into your queue.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or at least that’s what we were told by Liam Fox in 2017.The confidence beaming from the international trade secretary as he set off on his world tour to convince governments to do business with “global Britain” was notably absent this week.With little to show for his efforts, Fox\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspforced into an embarrassing climbdown, finally conceding that many of those\u0026nbsptrade deals had no chance of being ratified by 29 March.\u0026nbspSo where are we now – and why has Liam Fox fallen so far short of his own bar?No deal will be done in time with valuable trading partners Turkey and Japan, nor with the tiny European principalities of Andorra and San Marino.\u0026nbspCan UK continue trading with countries covered by an EU trade deal?Fox has so far delivered just six of the 40 deals he promised. The biggest positive he can point to is an agreement with Switzerland, a country which took £20bn of UK exports in 2017.By comparison, the UK shipped £278bn of goods and services to the EU in 2017. A deal with the trading bloc, Fox told us, would be “the easiest in human history”.\u0026nbspThe only other agreements he has so far been able to finalise in close to three years of toil account for a tiny percentage of UK trade. Israel is the largest among these, buying £2.4bn of UK goods and services, with £1.6bn flowing the other way.Agreements sealed with the Palestinian territories\u0026nbspand the Faroe Islands will do little to keep post-Brexit Britain afloat. We also have a deal with the 21 countries which make up the Common Market for\u0026nbspEastern and Southern Africa, but only Egypt accounts for anything more than a negligible amount of UK trade.Among the remaining countries in the group are two, which, according to official figures, imported no UK goods last year: Eritrea and Comoros.There is of course a chance that agreements will be reached in the next 35 days but Fox’s announcement hardly inspires confidence.He attempted to reassure the public with news that formal agreements are close with Fiji and Papua New Guinea.\u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspsimply served\u0026nbspto highlight the lack of progress on agreements with far more important trading partners.True, we have some form of agreement with the US, Australia and New Zealand but these mostly cover product standards. They aren’t full trade deals.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, CEO for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocate“Particularly intensive discussions” are happening with the European Economic Area, South African Customs Unions, Canada and South Korea, the trade secretary says – which sounds distinctly like they won’t be signed in time.It all seems like tinkering around the edges when you compare the figures involved to the vast sums of trade we conduct\u0026nbspwith the other 27 EU member states.None of this is to say that our trade secretary has been incompetent or lazy. No one said rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic was easy.\u0026nbspAnd negotiating trade deals is\u0026nbspeven more fiendishly complex – they frequently\u0026nbspamount to hundreds of clauses covering standards and tariffs on vast\u0026nbspnumbers of products.Deals often take\u0026nbspyears to finalise, even for skilled negotiators focused on one agreement, let alone 40.Whether through arrogance or ignorance, Liam Fox did not listen to trade experts who said dozens of EU deals could not be “rolled over” with ease.\u0026nbspHe assured everyone it could be done, but that was never truly the case.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Having to say bye to my dad when he’s in handcuffs just hurts my heart. It’s like immigration doesn’t want my family to succeed.”During a meeting at the Jamaican High Commission, the child –\u0026nbspsurrounded by her three sisters, the youngest just a toddler, and mother – delivered a moving testimony that shed light on the impact of immigration control on families.The meeting took place two weeks after\u0026nbspa charter flight taking 29 iniduals from the UK to Jamaica prompted outrage in the wake of the Windrush scandal. Commissioner Seth George Ramocan organised the gathering in the hope that it would\u0026nbsphelp\u0026nbspinform discussions about how they cooperate with the Home Office on future deportations.But there was little discussion about policy or intergovernmental cooperation. From the outset, the meeting was highly charged with emotion, with\u0026nbsprelatives giving\u0026nbspheart-rending accounts of having their loved ones “snatched” from them and sent against their will to a country that, often, they barely knew or remembered.The mother of one man who was on the charter flight – after coming to the UK aged 11 –\u0026nbspexplained how her son had arrived in Jamaica with no one to care for him, and made a passionate plea that “all of our children who came here when they were young should be here. This is degrading. Our children need to come back.”With so many relatives already driven to despair and desperation over the Home Office’s treatment of their loved ones, there was little the commissioner could say to temper them. It was clear that they had little faith in anything he said.This comes as no\u0026nbspsurprise when you consider that many of these people have suffered years of fear and hopelessness at the hands of the British government, despite never being subjected to immigration control themselves.We can debate the use of\u0026nbspcharter flights\u0026nbspand the wider\u0026nbsphostile environment as forms of immigration control,\u0026nbspbut whether\u0026nbspenough attention is paid to the indirect devastation this has on their loved ones is another question.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

The same can be said for an unusually high number of gazebos on College Green – the patch of grass outside the House of Lords from which journalists broadcast to the nation.This week an aerial view of the Palace of Westminster was beamed into living rooms across the country as another dramatic week in British politics unfolded.At 10am on Monday, seven MPs quit Jeremy Corbyn‘s Labour Party with a withering assessment of his leadership – the biggest schism in the party since the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the 1980s.May eyes potential route out of Brexit deadlock in BrusselsPost-Brexit Britain won’t have any trade links left at this rateEU’s Juncker says he is not optimistic about avoiding no-deal BrexitBarclays sets aside £150m to prepare for Brexit falloutThe following evening, an eighth MP left Labour’s ranks and on Wednesday – an hour before prime minister’s questions – Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen left the Conservative Party to join the opposition benches.Together, the 11 MPs have formed the Independent Group in the House of Commons and, though they have not yet formed a political party, the group has more MPs than the Democratic Unionist Party and the same number as the Liberal Democrats.It means Theresa May‘s effective majority in the chamber has been reduced to eight, making her reliance on the DUP to prop up the government ever more important.While this week has undoubtedly increased the instability at Westminster, the parliamentary arithmetic for Brexit hasn’t shifted a great deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Labour split: the reaction on Twitter Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The prime minister still faces the mammoth task of getting her deal through the Commons and, regardless of which side of the Commons the three ex-Tory MPs are sitting on, it is unlikely they will suddenly drop their opposition to Ms May’s deal.Support for a fresh referendum still does not appear to command a majority in the chamber, and the likelihood of the prime minister declaring her support for a customs union (one of Labour’s red lines) remains slim at best.But the current turmoil will inevitably have a considerable impact on the debate. The hardline Brexiteer Conservative MPs in the European Research Group – wary of the effect more defections from the party could have – may provide the prime minister with a temporary show of unity as she continues to negotiate with Brussels.And with just 36 days\u0026nbspuntil Brexit, wavering Labour MPs wanting to avoid a no-deal scenario may feel more inclined to back Ms May’s proposals.

But Britain’s exit from the EU is far from the only thing\u0026nbspon their minds. So how is Europe’s domestic politics affecting the Brexit process?Arguments over the status of Gibraltar play well in Spain, and Spanish governments of all stripes have tried to inject the issue into the Brexit process. So far this has been more of a nuisance than an existential threat, but Spain’s ability to veto any future trade deal could become a serious problem down the road. Spain disputes British sovereignty of the territory.Ireland is the EU country most directly affected by Brexit. In Ireland, to a much greater extent than the UK, a hard border on the island of Ireland is politically very unpopular. As a result, the Irish government has said it will not accept a border in any circumstances,\u0026nbspeven in a\u0026nbspno-deal scenario. This has caused problems of its own: Ireland’s position has made it harder for the EU to convince sceptical Brexiteers that the backstop is necessary.Emmanuel Macron isn’t going to Sharm el-Sheikh, but he has arguably been one of the most influential figures shaping the overall EU response to Brexit. A committed centrist, Mr Macron sees it as his duty to fight reactionary populism, a view shaped by the rise of the National Front in France. He sees Brexit as a strain of this politics and has pushed for the hardest line against Britain.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

These people do not.”While he said “we should not exaggerate the threat”, he then went on: “Obviously the threat as it is, is that whilst it won’t succeed itself which is absolutely guaranteed in my view, it may damage us.”Obviously the threat as it is, is that whilst it won’t succeed itself which is absolutely guaranteed in my view, it may damage usMr Lansman said Momentum – created in the wake of Mr Corbyn’s first leadership victory to support his left-wing policy agenda – will now use its campaigning force in the constituencies of the MPs who left the party this week to build pressure for by-elections.All have rejected calls from Labour’s top team to test the support of their local electorates.“We’re going to be collecting signatures for petitions in those constituencies,” he said. “Calling for by-elections. Having been elected on the basis of the manifesto that they are now rejecting – do the honourable thing.”Labour’s Thornberry says ‘I’d rather die than join another party’During a surprise press conference on Monday, Ms Berger was one of seven MPs to announce they were quitting Labour to form the Independent Group in the Commons.Asked whether he believed more resignations were to follow in the coming days, Mr Lansman replied: “I don’t know the iniduals concerned well enough. I hear rumours and they may have some foundation – I hope not.”“Compared to our current voting intention figures, it’s clear that the Independent Group are taking support from the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats – though it’s Labour who take the biggest knock,” the pollsters said.\u0026nbspBut Mr Lansman dismissed the findings, adding: “I think polls taken on the basis of today’s headlines for an organisation that has not said anything about what it stands for have to be taken with a great deal of scepticism. I think it will be some time before the polls yield anything like accurate information.”\u0026nbspKicked out of the party in the 1980s by then leader Neil Kinnock, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council caused controversy at the time for overseeing an illegal “deficit” budget in protest at Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government.\u0026nbspWhile Mr Lansman said that it should be possible for iniduals to be given a hearing by Labour’s governing body – the National Executive Committee – for possible readmission, he added: “I’m sceptical however, I am certainly not enthusiastic about his readmission to the party – let me put it that way.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

One of the questions they are bound to discuss is: who is going to be their leader? Our chief political commentator assesses the candidates.\u0026nbspThe early favourite. Heidi Allen, one of the Conservative defectors, said she thought it was “obvious” it should be him. This caused some irritation among other members of the group who thought this was taking the idea of being liberated to say what they think too far.\u0026nbspUmunna is an articulate communicator who was already the most visible face of the campaign for a second referendum and – we have an interest to declare – a columnist for The Independent.\u0026nbspHis negatives are a string of positions taken in the past from which he has now moved on, such as voting to invoke Article 50 and arguing to leave the EU single market, and a reputation for indecision dating from the time when he pulled out of standing for the Labour leadership after a few days in 2015.\u0026nbspHe has the advantage of plainly wanting the post – “I want to play the biggest role that I possibly can,”\u0026nbsphe told The Times today – but his strongest claim may be that he has been the organising force of the week’s defections, which, with the exception of Joan Ryan and Ian Austin, were coordinated by Umunna’s staff through his House of Commons office.The star of the launch of the new group on Monday, she came into the room first and spoke first, with real sincerity and clarity. Even her opening mistake, introducing herself as “the Labour MP for…” before correcting to just “the MP for Liverpool Wavertree”, was a testament to the personal struggle each of the defectors has been through to give up longstanding party identity.\u0026nbspIt would send a powerful message to the Labour Party, which has yet to have a permanent female leader, for her to lead the Independent Group, the first parliamentary group to have a majority of female members (seven women and four men).\u0026nbspBut there are practical problems in that she is eight months pregnant if she were chosen as leader the group would need a deputy to stand in for a while.\u0026nbspThe most experienced of the group, having served as a minister, attending cabinet if never a full cabinet minister. Huge confidence and a forceful speaker. Tendency to speak her mind to the extent of saying, unhelpfully for the rest of the group, that she supported George Osborne’s fiscally responsible policies as chancellor in the coalition government.\u0026nbspIt would also be curious positioning for the group to have a former Conservative as leader, when the richer recruiting grounds are on the Labour benches in the House of Commons.\u0026nbspThat said, the Conservative defectors are valuable to the group’s identity with the voters outside parliament, giving it a cross-party appeal and cutting against what would otherwise be the group’s image as simply a reversion to the pre-Corbyn Labour Party.\u0026nbspSoubry would therefore be a strong contender as deputy leader.\u0026nbspIf she hadn’t already endorsed Umunna as leader, Allen could have been a contender herself. She was the star of the Tory defectors’ event on Wednesday, in that she was the least known of the three and yet came across well.\u0026nbspNone of the three seems to be a traditional Conservative, but Allen has often sounded like a Labour MP in the House of Commons\u0026nbsp Last week, for example, she asked Theresa May to end the benefits freeze at Prime Minister’s Questions, and at the launch of the three defectors she said the government had “deepened” the suffering of people on benefits, “while having the power to fix it”.\u0026nbspThe strength of the Independent Group is that it has several members who could easily lead a political party. Leslie is another experienced politician, having been the youngest postwar minister at the cabinet office at the age of 29 in 2001, and even serving briefly as shadow chancellor for four months after Ed Balls lost his seat in 2015.\u0026nbspHis waspish sense of humour was on display on BBC Question Time this week. Andy McDonald, the sacrifice offered by the Labour Party, said it was dealing with the problem of antisemitism and mentioned the report by Shami Chakrabarti. “Baroness Chakrabarti?” asked Leslie, adding that he thought there was a problem with an “independent” inquiry carried out by someone immediately elevated to the shadow cabinet via the House of Lords.\u0026nbspIf Umunna has second thoughts about the leadership, and Berger doesn’t want it, Leslie could capably step into the breach.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I don’t think anywhere else would warm to that,” he told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme.Prof Goodwin said Labour’s economic policies were generally popular, as was\u0026nbspthe Tory agenda on immigration. But he suggested there was little pent-up demand for an economically and socially liberal party, as the Independent Group appears to be.“I would argue that actually voters are not in that space, that voters are basically looking for a party that’s a bit left-wing on economics (and) more right-wing on cultural issues,” he said.“That, of course, is not where this new party is aiming for.”While the\u0026nbspcollective’s Tory defectors backed government\u0026nbspausterity measures, former Labour MP Chris Leslie has revealed the group opposes renationalisation and is against increasing the top rate of tax to 50 per cent – policies that polls have\u0026nbspshown to be\u0026nbsprepeatedly\u0026nbsppopular.MPs\u0026nbsp(Getty)Deborah\u0026nbspMattinson, pollster with the Britain Thinks research group, said the election system\u0026nbsp“is stacked against” a big change in the political landscape.“There is a gap, but I would say that in a way the gap isn’t a policy one – it’s a leadership gap,” she said.“People are looking for a different kind of leadership, and actually when we dig down to what people\u0026nbspare really dissatisfied with, it is about the two leaders that are being served up to them at the moment.”Earlier this week a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll found that 14 per cent of the public would vote for the Independent Group if it put up candidates at a general election. A Sky Data poll found 10 per cent of voters willing to back the group, while a\u0026nbspSurvation\u0026nbsppoll put it at\u0026nbsp8 per cent.‘Funny tinge’ proves that the real progressives stand with CorbynAnthony Wells, YouGov’s research director, said his own company’s poll showed the new grouping was “taking support from the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats – though it’s Labour who take the biggest knock”.Leo\u0026nbspBarasi, public opinion expert, said he thought it was too early to tell what kind of support the group might be able to build.Independent Group will back May in any vote of confidence, says AllenChuka Umunna ‘obvious’ candidate to lead new Independent Group“At the moment we’re polling an idea of something, rather than something specific… it feels like these numbers have the potential to change very dramatically, possibly in either direction,” he told the\u0026nbspPolling Matters\u0026nbsppodcast.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has already offered to work with the new group, hinting at a possible electoral pact by saying it would be “foolish” for them to stand candidates against each other.Yet Chris Leslie, one of the original seven MPs who formed the group, said although they would be willing to cooperate with MPs from all parties, “we are not joining the Liberal Democrats”.One of the big issues to be resolved by the breakaway MPs, if it does set up formally as a political party, is settling on a leader.Two of the Conservative defectors, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry,\u0026nbspsaid on Friday that ex-Labour shadow minister Chuka Umunna would be the “obvious” person to lead the group.“You need to establish quite quickly who your leader is going to be, and get your message out there,” Ms Mattinson\u0026nbsptold Today. “The best moment is quite early on when you’ve still got a blank canvas.”Just hours after the launch of the group, which was set up partially in response to accusations of antisemitism in the Labour Party, it was caught up in a row over racist language used by one of its members on live TV.Angela Smith later apologised for referring to ethnic minority people as being “a funny tinge”, claiming she had been “very tired”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I have absolutely no idea what is going on.Brexit is like the UK took a motorway exit, then found the road turning into a rutted grassy track, and now the car\u0027s stuck in a muddy field, there\u0027s no help in sight, it\u0027s getting dark, everyone\u0027s shouting at the driver, and the passengers are beginning to worry about food.Watching Brexit is like watching someone try and plug a coaxial aerial cable into a HDMI port. There is a lot of anger, a lot of swearing, and a lot of remarks about how this used to work before.#Brexit is like going back to Windows 3.1I\u0027m sure most people remember a kid at school who just lied constantly? Who refused to back down, however outlandish the lie, and however it was disproven?Trying to extricate ourselves from the EU, and Brexit, is like a multiple transplant patient attempting to give all the donated organs back.Paying my taxes to pay for Brexit is like asking a guy on death row if he has any change to put in the meter for the electric chair.Brexit is like watching Bandersnatch with your bae where bae is 70,000 Conservative party members hogging the PlayStation controller \u0026amp  choosing the most WTF option every time.!Brexit is like the shit that never comes. Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.The official Foreign Office take, retweeted by Mr Hunt, was a social media message about the foreign secretary visiting four European capitals and insisting: “It is possible to find a way through this, of course it’s challenging, of course there are difficulties but there is a solution.”Jeremy Hunt says EU shares responsibility to prevent no-deal BrexitDisobliging members of the British public have replied to that tweet by observing: “He’s certain to be winning friends and influencing people with his cringeworthy ignorance of the ex-Yugoslav nations,”\u0026nbspand: “You did really well in Slovenia, Jeremy. They love you now!”It is not unprecedented for Mr Hunt to make unfortunate comments on his first diplomatic missions to countries.Jeremy Hunt lobbies Germany to lift ban on arms sales to Saudi ArabiaHunt slapped down by Downing Street for suggesting Brexit delayHe marked his first visit to Beijing as foreign secretary by trying to impress his hosts by saying his wife is Japanese.\u0026nbspShe is actually Chinese, and as Mr Hunt acknowledged, it was a “terrible mistake to make”.The two nations have been rivals for centuries and Chinese memories remain raw of Japan’s brutal occupation of parts of their country during the 1930s and 1940s.The Independent has asked the Foreign Office for comment.We’ll tell you what’s true.

If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470186283-e1550618418677.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remainer brexit lies honda swindon","story":"They even dispute the car giant’s own bosses bluntly and repeatedly spelling out that it “is not related to Brexit”.It simply must be. They need it to be.The facts, though, are that Japan no longer needs to make cars in Europe because the EU trade deal it has finally signed will cut its export tarfs to zero.Hence its Turkish plant closing too.Meanwhile the UK factory has struggled for years, making far fewer cars than it once did, with sales falling and the war on diesels forcing Honda to refocus on electric vehicles.It is vital that Government incentives and a low-tax economy lure another big employer to Swindon to prevent these devastating and traumatic job losses.But it is grim to see some Remainers concerned only with weaponising them against Brexit, while sniggering that the Wiltshire town voted Leave.BREXIT uncertainty is spooking some firms. But they’re a minority judging by the remarkably rosy new pay and jobs figures.Wages up . per cent, their fastest since . And with inflation down to . per cent, those pay rises count.Employment is at a record high of .million.

None of the widespread condemnation of her actions is a patch on the revulsion that comes from the British Muslim community itself.It was bad enough she joined IS as a -year-old but what makes my blood boil is how she repeatedly claims her actions were something to do with Islam.No, they really aren’t.Her support for a murderous cult is nothing to do with the Islam that I recognise.When asked about witnessing beheadings and executions she said she wasn’t bothered because she thought they were “Islamically OK”.No, they are not.This twisted, toxic interpretation of Islam is anathema to me — and it is certainly not something we grew up following as second-generation Muslims in this country.We were taught from a young age that Muslims had to be compassionate towards everyone, whatever their faith.I grew up in a mixed community in Bradford, where I still live.We always took presents to our Christian neighbours at Christmas and ate sweets with our Hindu neighbours at Diwali. We celebrated each other’s religious festivals and had friends from all dferent backgrounds. I always heard about how Islam meant peace and how the Prophet was well known for being kind, honest and gentle.Now, thanks to the actions of Begum and her ilk, people sneer when they hear the phrase “Religion of peace”.The truth is, that in the Koran there are strict rules about warfare. You are not even allowed to harm a tree, so targeting children at a pop concert is completely unthinkable.Still, Begum talks about how “unjust” the decision to boot her out of the UK is and repeatedly asks for sympathy.Sorry, but I reserve my sympathy for the rest of us in the Muslim community.Every single time there is an incident around the world we hold our breath, hoping and praying it was not a misguided “Muslim” behind the attack.Since   there has ALWAYS been a backlash, and it is ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who bear the brunt.According to one anti-racism charity there were more than , attacks on Muslims last year — a rise of  per cent — and women are disproportionately targeted.Women who wear the headscarf say they live in fear. They have been verbally abused, a few have even had their hijabs ripped off their heads — and Begum’s interviews will pour petrol on that fire.High-profile Muslim celebrities such as boxer Amir Khan posted on Twitter that “arrogant” Shamima is giving all Muslims a bad name. It is hard to disagree.The far right will gleefully tar us all with the same brush, using the actions of ONE inidual to paint the WHOLE community as traitors.Despite this, we know that Britain is not as racist as other countries in Europe.When I went to Paris I was told repeatedly that le for immigrants in France is very dficult. Spain and Italy are among other EU nations that continue to show naked hostility and xenophobia towards Muslims, both in the street and among their politicians. Sure, when our parents came here in the s and s they also had to endure dficulties, but a lot has changed since then.Areas such as Bethnal Green, where Begum comes from, is not a ghetto hotbed of radicalism.Muslim men, women and children live harmoniously next to bearded hipsters sucking on their soy lattes, and it is this cosmopolitanism that makes it such a cool place to live.British people are, at heart, compassionate and kind. AndBegum had shown genuine remorse, repentance or humility I am certain the voices crying out for her forgiveness and safewould have been heard.There are still people arguing for her to be given another chance here, saying she was very young when she fled the UK and that she must have been groomed.But she didn’t go to Syria to work for a charity or help on humanitarian grounds. She went for the specic reason of becoming an IS bride, and supporting terror.It is ironic that the person who stripped Shamima Begum of her citizenship is, like her, the child of immigrants.Whatever the legal ramications of her citizenship, for the Muslim community the damage has been done — and sadly THAT can’t be as easily revoked as her passport.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or about the Tories, under their most left-wing leader in a generation, in fact being ruled by compassionless brutes.It’s window dressing aimed at disguising their sole obsession, a catastrophically isive second Brexit referendum.Perhaps they need to justy it to themselves. Because Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen backed the  referendum, vowed to respect the result, voted for Article , then stood for election promising Brexit in full: no single market, no customs union.They now consider it “extreme” to keep those promises instead of breaking them. Ex-colleagues honouring the referendum and manesto are “anti-EU zealots”.Wollaston and Soubry represent Leave constituencies. Wollaston even campaigned for Leave initially. How can these hypocrites deny their duped ­constituents immediate by-elections and a “final say” on their duplicity At least, though, we now know the new Independent Group’s only policy: to reverse Brexit. The Labour MPs mainly quit Corbyn’s party over its vile anti-Semitism and economic insanity. The Tories’ recruitment shts the entire focus.Their anti-Brexit arguments, though, are the same old Remoaner claptrap.Soubry even trotted out the feeblest of all, counting non-voters to claim  per cent of us did not back Brexit: A child’s logic, applying to every election ever.Allen claimed they heard the “clarion call for change” from .million Leave voters. They intend to ignore them.They said “compassionate Conservatism” had been sidelined, airbrushing out their own role as serial rebels helping to paralyse Theresa May’s Government.But now they hope she will dump the DUP and make a pact with them in exchange for their “people’s vote”. She could,she wished to destroy her party.The Tories rightly aim to be a “broad church”. But these three shameless defectors, puffed up on sanctimony and epic self-regard, were irreconcilable.They have betrayed their party and their voters. And they’re not done yet.NEXT week backbench MPs could snatch power from the Government over Brexit in one of the most recklessly insane acts ­Parliament has seen.A Labour-backed vote, joined by Tory Remainers, would “take No Deal off the table” and effectively end the PM’s negotiations. The fact this is the brainchild of Oliver “Poll Tax” Letwin should tell you what chaos it will unleash.Which is doubtless why the EU is going cold on compromising. Why should it,Remainers will postpone Brexit Tory Leave MPs must not assume this will fail. Brexit is in mortal danger.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Your mind is bought and sold by their computer programs — with no human intervention required.You are the digital content they auction off for sale to the highest bidder. Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This girl was a victim when she went out there at  years old.“Our politicians are saying that she should be denied protections and due process that would have been granted to Nazis.”Labour declined to comment.Mr McDonnell’s comments came in a letter to then Home Secretary Theresa May.He said she should censure Brits serving in the Israeli Defence Force .A Labour party spokesman explained that the call came during the height of “barbaric bombing and attacks on Gaza where hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children were being killed”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If there’s a sense they don’t need to do anything signicant like we have, I don’t think that’s right.”Speaking to her local paper – the Cambridge Independent - Heidi Allen claimed the country was “desperate for a new moderate, centre ground party”.She added: “The response has been unbelievable. You dare to dream that we might just do something with this new project.“We are not in a rush. We want to build from the ground up. It’s grass roots, wiping the slate clean and starting again.“We do want to take things slowly and make sure we get it right. But that is of course the ambition: a new party and ultimately to be in government.”THEY’RE not short of ego, are they The new -strong Independent Group of MPs say their ultimate aim is to form a Government. As it stands they can just about form a Sunday league side.Andwe were in any doubt their only real policy so far is to overturn Brexit, Ian Austin’s refusal to join clinches it.As for a “new kind of politics”, all we see is a club of centre-ground Europhile Labour and Tory MPs who vaguely agree they preferred Blairrunning the show.Forget the spin.

A man raised by Jewish parents to battle anti-Semites, only to watch the party he loved for  years become a safe space for them.There was no regretful farewell from Corbyn’s malevolent mob. Only the sniping insults of Chris Williamson, a fan of Venezuela’s vicious tyranny and probably Parliament’s most odious MP.What a state the Opposition is now in.But the “moderates” who remain are in denialthey think it can be saved.Labour peer Lord Bragg tells The Sun he hopes for a new leader — and to “change it from within”. That is even less likely than “reforming” the EU.Corbyn and his cronies have won. Ed Miliband and others gted the party to them.

But Corbyn says that is now “very much part of the agenda”.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell admits the party is “moving towards a people’s vote”, even using the Remainer- run ­campaign’s deceitful nickname.The vast majority of Labour’s at-risk marginal seats, and those they need to win to take power, backed Leave.And those voters are watching.THEY’RE not short of ego, are they The new -strong Independent Group of MPs say their ultimate aim is to form a Government. As it stands they can just about form a Sunday league side.Andwe were in any doubt their only real policy so far is to overturn Brexit, Ian Austin’s refusal to join clinches it.As for a “new kind of politics”, all we see is a club of centre-ground Europhile Labour and Tory MPs who vaguely agree they preferred Blairrunning the show.Forget the spin.

where she had been staying with her dad Robert MacPhail, , and grandparents - for the day to attend the celebration at softplay centre Dinom, near her mother Georgina Lochrane’s home in Airdrie, Lanarkshire.She had been escorted there on July , by her doting grandfather, -year-old George Lochrane, who was eager to spend time with his “wee pal” during her summer break.But little did he know that would be the last time he would see his darling granddaughter alive, as the youngster travelled back to Bute later that day and that night would be abducted as she slept by the “monster” teenager, who was armed with a kne.Today, as The Scottish Sun exclusively print the precious snaps, Alesha’s heartbroken mother Georgina, , wishing she could turn back time, saidshe’d only taken Alesha home with her, she could have been kept safe from the clutches of the Bute beast.Instead excited Alesha ed on the ferry and just hours later was taken in the night by cannabis and computer games obsessed psycho.Brave Georgina said: “He clearly had this well planned and well thought through.“If it wasn’t Alesha it would have been another child andhe wasn’t caught we have would have more kids killed by that monster.“She had gone on July , just hours before that ‘thing’ got to her.“She had gone over to Bute on the Thursday and this party was on the Sunday and she went back to Bute after the party.”On that tragic evening, Alesha been tucked up in bed by dad Robert MacPhail at .pm, after enjoying watching a Peppa Pig DVD.Hours later, boozed-up Campbell crept into her dad’s house at am – which was a five minute walk from his house – and snatched the youngster from her bedroom, subjected her to a savage sexual attack and smothered her to death.The callous brute was then caught on CCTV casually ing home for a shower.We told yesterday how shattered Georgina revealed how she had a mother’s instinct something was wrong – and woke up consumed by an inexplicable ache for her little girl hours before she learned she was missing.And she was horried to read online tributes from strangers as police launched a search.On Thursday a jury found the teenage maniac - who was obsessed with the horror character Slender Man – unanimously guilty of her rape and murder after a nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow.The trial heard how Alesha suffered  separate injuries at the hands of the warped psycho.He smothered her to death after subjecting her to a sick sexual attack in a secluded spot after carrying her there.The jury heard incontrovertible proof of his guilt - including damning billion-to-one DNA evidence linking him to the crime scene - and chilling CCTV footage showing him skulking from his mum’s home the night of the slaughter.They ed a unanimous verdict prompting Alesha’s outraged dad Robert, , to shout “f*****g scumbag” as cruel Campbell was led to the cells in handcuffs.Just seconds before Lord Matthews had told Campbell: “Alesha MacPhail was a sweet, angelic little girl.“She would’ve gone home to her mother looking forward to tell stories to her and her friends.“Instead of that you came into her le and stole her le.”Lord Matthews also told the High Court in Glasgow the case “was one of the wickedest and most evil crimes in the history of this court”.The twisted teen was not able to be named throughout the hearing because of his age and had been referred to as ‘AC’ whenever the trial was called over the court tannoy.But a ban on identying Campbell was lted on Friday.Tony Graham QC - representing the media - argued it was in the “public interest” for the teen to be exposed.Judge Lord Matthews agreed to lt the ban on identying the killer.Following the decision, we told how the child’s mother wanted him to “rot in jail” and her grandfather wished he had been hanged.And later Alesha’s heartbroken parents – who split just months after Alesha was born – each changed their profile picture to one of their little girl wearing a fireman’s hat – which was now emblazoned with angel wings.The heart-warming act saw friends and family leave dozens of heartfelt and encouraging messages in memory of the “angel”.Pal Dayna Hughes wrote: “Beautul so she is Genie”, while another Kathleen Quinn added: “Just perfect.”Meanwhile on Rab’s profile, Stephanie Mcdowall wrote: “Fly high beautul angel, as Theresa Minnes added: “Chin up Rab. You’ll have your own wee angel everywhere you go…Fly high beautul.”His pal, John Bell added: “Think of you and the family mate, keep the chin up.”Campbell – who was accused of killing and skinning cats by islanders – will be sentenced next month pending reports about his mental state.His name will also be put on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/KH-3-DAY-FORECAST-23FEBAM.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather forecast sun temperature heatwave","story":"The latest weather forecast based on MetDesk data shows more spring-like weather on the way before downpours at the beginning of March.Brits are today enjoying unseasonably warm temperatures in the high-teens up and down the country.And the heatwave is set to continue for at least the next ten days.Sara Thornton, director of digital weather company Weathertrending told The Sun Online: Temperatures may ease a touch later through the weekend, with fog patches keeping some spots a lot chillier.However early next week, records may again be threatened, as the air warms up again.And as the weeks go by the sun is getting every stronger, meaning higher temperatures become more likely.But after the surge in temperature next week, a cold snap will follow in the early days of March.A fiver will be paid into your bank account within four months of completing the switch. prepayment meter customer customers will receive a £ Amazon voucher.

It’s the same story we’ve be telling consistently at this embassy for the last  months since my arrival here.This official visit by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will highlight Morocco’s focus on women’s empowerment, girls education, inclucivity and the encouragement of social entrepreneurship.The pair are making only their third official overseas trip together, following visits to Dublin and a tour of Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacic last year.The royal couple are set to have a busy few days with seven official engagements lined up.After landing in the North African country Prince Harry and Meghan are expected to travel to the capital Rabat.Meghan, , who is seven months pregnant, and her husband have no official duties this evening.They are due to fly by helicopter tomorrow to Asni, at the foot of the Atlas Mountains to see the work being done by the charity Education For All, which helps provide an education for girls aged  to  in rural parts of the country.Meghan is expected to take part in a Henna ceremony and the couple will then watch a secondary school football match.The pair will then attend a formal reception hosted by the British Ambassador in Rabat.Their itinerary on Monday starts with a visit to the Moroccan Royal Federation of Equestrian Sports, which helps support children with special needs.There they will watch a riding demonstration and attend a horse-grooming session with some of the kids.They will then go to Villa Des Ambassadors, which teaches disadvantaged children how to cook traditional recipes and will meet disabled kids who work in a specially-designed restaurant.Finally they will visit a market run by social entrepreneurs and meet young people.Security fears had been sparked for the royal visit after riots erupted in Rabat earlier this week during a march by teachers demanding more pay.Royal protection officers are said to be worried about the situation and have banned the royal couple from walkabouts.The tour comes days after Meghan enjoyed a baby shower in New York with pals including Serena Williams.Meghans trip to the Big Apple was criticised in some quarters after the lavish visit was said to have cost £,.Princess Dianas former private secretary Patrick Jephson described the private visit as pretty unedying.Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, first visited Morocco in  and then again in  with the Duchess of Cornwall."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000405750581.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remember nicki waterman by raising tumour treatment cash","story":"Through private pioneering immunotherapy treatment Nicki managed to prolong her le and was convinced it could one day offer a cure to NHS patients throughout the UKthere was enough investment into research.Now this research is finally taking place to find that cure and the first trial of NHS patients has started - but without more charitable donations it won’t have the funds to continue to the next stages.That’s why today the Sun on Sunday has teamed up with Alex, , and her best friend Hayley Costa, , whose mum Beverly also tragically died from a brain tumour five-years-ago to launch the ‘Use Your Brain Campaign’ to help raise this money.Alex said: “Mummy just wanted to help everyone - and she inspired me to follow in her footsteps.“There was very little anyone could do for her when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. We don’t currently have effective treatments to offer patients but by raising money for research we can help fight this cruel cancer together.”They are the biggest cancer killer of children and adults under  yet just two per cent of the £ million yearly research budget goes into looking for cures for brain tumours.Immunotherapies are the great hope in cancer medicine. They are drugs that harness the body’s own ability to kill cancer cells and it allowed Nicki, who died in August  aged just , the precious extra time to see her son Harry get married.And it was what Baroness Tessa Jowell turned to in Germany after running out of options in London.Nicki’s doctor, medical oncologist Paul Mulholland from The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, has already started the trial on NHS patients across the UK.The National Brain Appeal charity has helped raise nearly half of the £, target needed for the initial research but they need help to raise the rest.Paul told us: “A new approach is needed for the treatment of brain cancer. We are aiming to bring together the newest drugs together with the latest developments in scientic research to find a cure for this devastating disease.“This will be achieved through a rolling programme of clinical trials. Our first trial is open and is currently recruiting.It is called the IPI-GLIO immunotherapy trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma brain cancer patients in the UK.The next phase will be to run multiple, smaller trials where the trial design will be adapted depending on the results that are obtained.“This is the quickest route to finding a cure for brain cancer.“The National Brain Appeal is fund-raising for this programme of clinical trials. Without this valuable help this programme would not have started and NHS brain cancer patients are being treated with new drugs today thanks to the charity.“This was something that Nicki Waterman wanted and felt passionate about. She had access to immunotherapy treatment due to having private healthcare and she wanted this to be extended to NHS patients.“I’m sorry that Nicki is not here to see this achievement given that she was so powerful in raising awareness to help to make it happen. It is admirable how Nicki’s daughter Alex and her friend Hayley have turned the tragedy of losing their mothers into something positive by raising awareness of brain cancer and helping to raise money for these clinical trials.”Almost , people are diagnosed each year with a primary brain tumour -  people every day and they reduce le expectancy by on average  years - the highest of any cancer. Just  per cent of adults survive for five years after diagnosis.Alex and Hayley tragically know just how cruel this disease can be. Alex - speaking ahead of Brain Tumour Awareness Month which starts next week - said: “Brain tumours are so common, so deadly but yet receive such little funding. This is about finding a cure. I am so excited about these trials - and raising money to make sure that cure is found.“The Use Your Brain Campaign is about spreading some happiness while raising money and awareness.“Taking part is simple. We are asking people to do something kind - by giving a kind word to somebody who seems a bit down, stopping to chat to an elderly neighbour or just by listening to a friend in need - and then take a thumbs up selfie with the tag #useyourbrain.“And then the vital bit - donate to the appeal to help the research and stamp out this dreadful cancer.“I hope that this campaign spreads some happiness, kindness and fun too. We can all spare a couple of minutes a day to be kind to each other. It’s a no brainer!”Theresa Dauncey, Chief Executive of The National Brain Appeal, said that investment in brain cancer research has been ‘abysmal’She told us: “There is an urgent need for new treatments for this devastating disease We are so grateful to Alex, Hayley and the Sun on Sunday for their enthusiasm and support to help raise both awareness and funds for Dr Paul Mulholland’s clinical trials.”     Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hes got a lot of support and hes going to be vindicated on all these charges.Asked about the accusers, the lawyer added: I think all the women are lying, yes.This has become, Hey, R Kelly — I can say R Kelly did something — boom.There was a press conference yesterday — Oh, these two girls were assaulted by R Kelly! And the lawyer stood there with a picture of LL Cool J!He was referring to new claims he raped a  year-old fan while her friend hid in a hotel bathroom after he demanded a threesome.That alleged incident in Baltimore is not included in the ten charges filed against the star last night.Kelly, , is accused of abusing four victims — three of them aged from  to  — between  and .If convicted he faces three to seven years on each count, said Cook County States Attorney Kimberly Foxx.The charges came after campaigning lawyer Michael Avenetti uncovered video that allegedly shows R Kelly having sex with a girl who says on camera she is .Mr Greenburg said: I dont know what the tape is. We havent seen it. No ones showed us the tape.He claimed prosecutors had bowed to public pressure following allegations in the Netflix documentary Surviving R Kelly.He also said one of the charges appears to be linked to a decade-old case for possessing child abuse images.The singer was acquitted in  of having a tape that prosecutors claimed showed him having sex with a girl aged .His lawyer said: Double jeopardy should bar that case. He won that case.Earlier Kelly was driven to a Chicago police station in a van with tinted windows before making his way through the gathered media - during which he refused to answer questions.Mr Greenberg said Kelly was extraordinarily disappointed and depressed and adding: He is shellshocked by this.Celeb lawyer Michael Avenatti - who says he represents two of R Kellys alleged victims - said the charges marked a watershed moment.He said on Twitter: Its over. After  years of serial sexual abuse and assault of underage girls, the day of reckoning for R Kelly has arrived.Mr Avenatti said he began a thorough investigation last April after a concerned parent approached his office.Last week he gave prosecutors an explicit -minute tape featuring a man who appears to be R Kelly performing multiple sex acts with the girl, CNN reported.She and the singer refer to her age ten times, according to reports, and she calls him daddy.The man allegedly asks the girl to urinate before he urinates on her, the broadcaster claims.Kelly has faced claims of sexual abuse for more than two decades.The Surviving R Kelly documentary revealed harrowing accounts of his alleged abuse.The programme claimed he ran an abusive cult in which he allegedly kept women captive.Kellys lawyers dismissed the documentary as another round of stories being used to fill reality TV time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471237050.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ben mcbean becomes dad taliban explosion","story":"But war hero Ben McBean, who defied the odds to become a dad after suffering groin injuries in the Taliban bomb blast that cost him his limbs, has got it all worked out.The former Marine, dubbed “Harry’s hero” after he flew back from Afghanistan on the same flight as the Prince, declared: “In fact I am better at doing it than the missus!”Speaking about his joy at his unexpected fatherhood as he posed with son Albie,  months, and partner Zara, , Ben added: “Looking back, all the struggles have been worthwhile.“I am so glad I never gave up because now I have Albie and it’s the greatest thing in the world.”Millies Award winner Ben, , who had to have a testicle removed due to injuries caused by the explosion, also joked: “At least it all still works down there and my one remaining testicle was up to the task.”The former Commando, of Plymouth, Devon, lost his right leg and left arm when he stepped on a mine in February  while on patrol in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province. He was just  years old.Ben was one of two injured Marines to share a flight back to the UK with Prince Harry.The royal was forced to come home after his secret frontline mission was revealed.Ben admits becoming a dad was the furthest thing from his mind as he set out on the path to recovery.It was a long journey — with his groin injury requiring a new op long after the blast.He explained: “It was not until two years after the explosion that I had the testicle removed and a  one put in. I wasn’t that worried about a testicle after all I had been through.“I was only  when I was blown up, and back then I only had myself to think about and didn’t knowI’d ever get a girlfriend let alone become a dad.“I was given a choice about the operation to remove a ­testicle but told it could affect the other oneI kept it.“So looking back, that was a good choice and a wise ­decision, although I really wasn’t thinking about kids.“I had hundreds of injuries with shrapnel wounds all over my body, and still have shrapnel in me so it wasn’t that big a deal for me.”As he recovered, Ben met old schoolmate Zara, who is a nurse, in a pub on a night out in Plymouth.Ben — who won a Sun Overcoming Adversity Millie in  — recalled: “We got on well and just started chatting. We knew each other but weren’t close at school, and when I was back in Plymouth and doing rehab I bumped into a few old school people.“Zara is chilled and good fun. We have a normal relationship — it used to be date nights, but now it’s boxsets.”The lovebirds — who have been together for five years — did not plan the pregnancy but were overjoyed when Zara discovered she was expecting.Ben had never asked medics about his parenthood chances or had a sperm count or checks on his other testicle.He said: “We were shocked but extremely happy I have always wanted kids and when it happened and Zara got pregnant it was a surprise. It was not planned.“The only conversation we ever had about it was a jokey one with her saying, ‘Are you all right down there ’“I didn’t know but just said, ‘Yes, of course.’“But there’s only one way to find out, isn’t there — and I have proved it works!”Such a happy future was something Ben could never have imagined in .He said: “When I was first injured I thought, ‘I am in so much pain I’d rather be dead.’“It has been dficult to stay positive because there is nothing positive about having your arm and leg blown off.“I have had my struggles and now it all feels worthwhile. Now I look at Albie and often think, ‘Le isn’t so bad.’ ”But becoming a dad threw up fresh challenges — similar to the ones he faced in the aftermath of the explosion.He explained: “The birth was great, but to be honest having a child was scary.“Everyone who becomes a parent is nervous but I guess it was more so for me.“It was a bit like when I was first injured and had to figure out things like getting dressed when I only had one arm. But you adapt to it and work things out.“Now I can change a nappy with one arm — I use my stump leg to hold Albie’s legs up and now he’s a bit older he helps me out, too. I also figured out a way of getting him in the car seat, by clawing both bits together. I like to take him to the park but I know I’ll miss out on certain things like playing football with him and running around.”Ben has prosthetics including a walking and running leg and a  arm, but rarely wears them when he is at home with Zara and Albie. He continued: “It is a pain when you do things like make two cups of tea and have to make two ­journeys to get them.“But Zara and Albie help out a lot and Albie carries things for me, like his iPad.” Although they have no immediate plans to add to the family, Ben and Zara would like more children.The former  Commando Marine said: “In the future I think we will have more but we are not in a rush and are happy with our lives at the moment.”Brave Ben, who in  became the first double amputee to complete the London Marathon, was initially handed a compensation payout of just £, for his horric injuries. It was later raised to £,.He invested some of the money in property, making money from buying and ­selling around Plymouth.But for the last two years, the war hero has been beset by more health problems.“It was a case of one step forward, two steps back and I had a lot of problems so have calmed down in the last couple of years.“I also suffered mentally — and one morning could not face getting out of bed.“I was thinking about Afghanistan a lot and having flashbacks. You get to the point you feel like jumping out of a window.“I went downhill and kept myself to myself.“I had what I guess was PTSD and I went to the ­doctor. I was given anti- depressants which I took for a while.“But I thought, ‘This isn’t helping — these are just sedating me, not making it better’ so I processed the problems myself.“I try to stay happy and positive but it is not easy because you never forget about losing your arm and your leg — you never fully recover.“I am soon going to have the th anniversary of being blown up, but I have Zara and Albie with me, which is great.”Ben now works as a motivational speaker, giving talks to banks and businesses.He said: “My story is now better, as there is more to it and it’s not just a case of how I got injured and ­survived. I enjoy it and a few weeks ago I gave a talk to , people at the Excel Arena in London. That was nerve-racking!”And Ben has inspiring words for dad-to-be and old pal Prince Harry, who dubbed Ben the “real hero” after they jetted home together.Ben said: “I am glad he is doing well.“He has had his struggles with losing his mother and what he saw in Afghanistan — he saw injures like mine first-hand.“I am happy he’s with Meghan and they are ­expecting.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet Theresa May will brook no solution other than her own. Even when her negotiations with the EU are demonstrably shown to have failed and her proposals to Parliament are roundly rejected, she ploughs on. Her supporters hail her stubbornness as resilience, her enemies as stupidity. Yet it must be stupid for Mrs May to continue maintaining that it is either her deal or no deal. With only  days to go until Brexit, it is time someone told her: No way. And Gordon Brown does. He tells Sunday Mirror readers there is another way -only MPs will grasp it.  That is to postpone Brexit by up to a year while the British people are consulted over exactly what they now want from it.There are other options out there, and Mr Brown is right that they should all be given consideration. The former PM does not go as far as calling for a second referendum, though he admits that might be the result of what he is proposingthere is evidence attitudes have changed. He suggests instead using the time the postponement of Article  will buy for a series of citizens’ assemblies in which ordinary people can give their views on the way forward.

It’s aimed at under-s looking for harmless shyinteractive fun, but has become a hunting ground for child abusers, and a manual for eating disorders and self-harm.

Campbell, , snatched little Alesha from her bed as she visited her dad and grandparents on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, in July last year. He brutally attacked and raped the ft ins youngster before dumping her body in woodland on the scenic and sparsely populated island. Smiley Alesha, who loved watching Peppa Pig and baking cakes, was later found facedown and naked by a member of the public. She had  separate injuries - including catastrophic ones. Campbell, who lived on the island, was yesterday found guilty of her abduction, rape and murder by jurors at Glasgows High Court. And this afternoon, he could be identied for the first time after a judge allowed his name and images of him to be published. Lting a ban on identying the boy, Judge Lord Matthews said: I cant think of a case in recent times that has attracted such revulsion. But who is Campbell and what is his background  Below, we reveal everything we know so far about the monster.  What did Campbell do  Campbell abducted, raped and murdered Alesha, who was staying at the home her dad shared with her grandparents on Bute. The little girl, who was on a three-week summer break, had been put to bed with a Peppa Pig DVD on the night of July , . But the next morning, she was found to have vanished. The High Court later heard Campbell had snatched the girl from the bed where she was sleeping, before inflicting horric injuries on her. He then dumped her body in a woodland area on the island. Alesha was reported missing from her bed at .am on July , with Police Scotland launching a large-scale search to find her. At around am, her naked body was devastatingly found on the grounds of the islands former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel.  A post-mortem found she died from pressure to neck and face. Within days of Aleshas death, Campbell had been arrested and charged. During his trial, the court heard graphic details of Aleshas injuries, with a pathologist saying: Its extremely dficult to give an accurate time of death. When askedthe injuries observed were something he had witnessed before in his years of forensic experience, Dr John Williams replied: No. Yesterday, Lord Matthews told Campbell he had committed some of the wickedest, most evil crimes the High Court had ever heard. Who is Campbell  Campbell was a -year-old cannabis smoker, living on Bute. He had moved to the island with his family as a child, and lived with his mum, dad and younger sister in a traditional stone-built home. He had been born on the mainland, but his family had brought him to the island believing it would give him a secure upbringing. His mum told the Daily Mail: I wanted him to grow up in a safe place, a peaceful environment, and get a good education.  She added that her very normal son was doing an engineering course one day a week and had plans to go to university. Known to pals as a harmless joker with a dark sense of humour, Campbell had started regularly buying cannabis at the age of . He would drink at weekends with friends and had a girlfriend, who is reported to be standing by him despite his brutal crime. He also liked to practice parkour, which involves moving rapidly through areas and jumping from buildings, the Daily Record reports. And he was a fitness fan who enjoyed boxing and lting weights. A video of Campbell, posted on his YouTube channel the year before Aleshas murder, shows him doing carefree flips on a trampoline. He brags he recently went from doing front flip s to front flip .  Had he shown signs of violence  Campbells mum has said he wasnt a violent boy. But reports have claimed he was a “serial killercaught on his first murder” who was obsessed with the horror character Slender Man. He is alleged to have been obsessed with gore and violence. A police source told The Sun: “Slender Man searches were found and it chilled seasoned investigators to the bone. Some of the circumstances between what this character does and what happened to Alesha were carbon copies.” The teenager was filmed playing violent video games, and officers found evidence he had searched online for the Slender Man. In one clip, he can reportedly be heard shouting stab and shank. In another, he yells: That is Slender Man right there.” Slender Man is a fictional character that began le as an Internet meme before growing into something much darker.  He has long arms, which he uses to prey on children, and is portrayed as a black and white image on the periphery of photos. Campbell is also alleged to have nearly drowned a dferent young girl at a leisure centre pool years before Aleshas murder. He was just six or seven when he held the youngsters head under the water for so long she feared she would drown, Bute locals claimed. And the killer is said to have slaughtered and skinned cats in his younger teens, apparently burying two feline corpses in his garden. One neighbour also claimed Campbell had become a local nuisance on Bute and was once caught trying to set fire to buildings. None of the stories, including the near-drowning, have been corroborated, but they have been making the rounds on the island. However, his mum insisted to the Mail: He wasn’t a violent boy. He smoked cannabis, but it’s re among kids on this island.  What did Campbell tell pals  After Alesha vanished, Campbell chipped in with speculation and rumours about what may have happened on a Snapchat group chat. He even sent a video of himself to pals on the group and said: Found the guy whos done it - something a friend thought was a bad joke. The teenager also sent friends a chilling Facebook message saying he might kill one day for the letime experience, his trial heard. The court was told he exchanged messages about killing with a pal. The female friend asked him the chances of getting away with murder with a good plan, to which he said: Wellit was a gd plan then %. She later messaged: Im glad Im not at the top of your hit list. In response, he was alleged to have said: No one is. The witness agreed these were theoretical exchanges where she brought up the subject of murder and at the time caused her no concern. She said they both had a dark sense of humour. And she agreed the conversation was not serious and just rubbish.  What did Campbell claim about the murder  After police were led to Campbell by his own mum, the monster told ious lies about what he did on the night Alesha vanished. Sickeningly, he even tried to blame Mr MacPhails innocent partner, Toni McLachlan, for the crime and claimed hed had an affair with her. On his trials first day, he lodged a special defence of incrimination, naming Ms McLachlan as the person responsible for the killing. However, jurors heard DNA matching Campbell was pretty well all over Aleshas body and clothes, and he had told police a pack of lies. Giving evidence in court himself, the teenager told the jury hed never do something like that in reference to the attack last summer. He claimed that he never met Alesha MacPhail in person. Askedhe brutalised the girl, he said: Its not me, absolutely not. I would never do something like that.  But when jurors were out of the courtroom, he is said to have been spotted smirking. The teenager, described as an adrenaline junkie, also told the court he and Ms McLachlan had met up and had sex early on July . He claimed he did not want to tell police this as he feared it would get back to Mr MacPhail and he would hurt Ms McLachlan. But addressing the jury on Wednesday, advocate depute Iain McSporran QC, prosecuting, said the teenager was telling a pack of lies then [to the police] and a pack of lies in the witness box. During his closing speech, Mr McSporran put it to jurors that they had heard no evidence implicating Ms McLachlan in the crime but a mountain of evidence linking the accused to it. He also said a claim by Campbell - that Ms McLachlan had taken the condom the two allegedly used on July , gone back to the house where she had been staying with her partner, Alesha and the girls grandparents, abducted the schoolgirl, carried her to the woods, smothered her to death and then planted the accuseds semen inside her - was a preposterous story. However, the teenagers defence lawyer, Brian McConnachie QC, urged the jury to acquit his client, questioning why he would abduct, rape and murder the youngster having never met her in his le.  What was he convicted of  Yesterday, justice was finally served as Campbell was unanimously convicted of abduction, rape and murder by jurors. Another charge against him - defeating the ends of justice - had been dropped by the prosecution on the eighth day of proceedings. The killer - who now faces le behind bars - had denied all charges. Aleshas loved ones broke down in tears as the verdict was ed. Campbell will be sentenced next month. Why couldnt Campbell be identied  During his nine-day trial for Aleshas murder, the teenager could not be identied for legal reasons because he is aged under .

Little Thomas Evans is the double of Alfie – the -month-old who died after a heartbreaking legal battle by his parents. Thomas is six months old and his dad Tom today reveals how having a new baby has brought a joy he and partner Kate James feared they would never experience again. Tom, , told the Sunday Mirror: “Thomas is Alfie’s double, the resemblance is amazing. “When we see Thomas pull a face he looks like Alfie, we feel that in a way we have them both with us.  “He’s such a happy baby, he does nothing but smile. I had a great connection with Alfie and I feel like I’ve got the same with Thomas. “We’re hanging in there, keeping sane, doing as well as we can. I wouldn’t know where I was without baby Thomas. “I’ve got something to wake up to with him. I have to keep happy for Thomas’s sake. I wouldn’t want to wake upit wasn’t for the baby. “I don’t like to think what it would be like without Thomas. I worryhe wasn’t here, where would I be  “How would I be  What would my mental health be ”   Tom was speaking as he and Kate revealed a pound, fund for Alfie will be spent on helping sick children. The proud dad added: “When Thomas gets older we want him to understand what Alfie went through and he can know good came from it. We’d like to help children around the UK and the world.” The picture of Tom and Thomas is a ray of light after two years of pain and torment. Tom and Kate had fought to keep Alfie on a le support machine in a case which drew global attention. They lost, ultimately, and their son died at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital from an ultra-rare degenerative brain disease. Kate, , fell pregnant with Thomas as the legal battle – which taxed her and Tom to the limits – was played out. But the couple stayed together through those tough times and are now devoted to Thomas. Tom said: “Kate is a great mum for Thomas. She has moments when she’s upset and she has a cry. That’s what you have to do to release the emotion. Mums have that bond, especially with the first child.” He accused doctors of separating him and Kate in hospital and telling her that the legal battle was wrong. Tom went on: “It was hard. She questionedwe were doing the right thing. I told her what we were doing, what our friends and family were doing, was the right thing for Alfie. But it wasn’t easy. It was hard for her to hear the arguments of the doctors every day. There was a lot of strain, but we stayed together. “We both loved Alfie and both wanted the best for Alfie. “We remained tough. They were telling her I was wrong. She was pregnant and her hormones and emotions were all over the place.”  The arrival of Thomas triggered a wave of emotions for the couple. Tom explained: “I was nervous but felt happy. We had the test done and he didn’t have the same genes as Alfie, we were told he would be okay. “We were happy that Alfie had a brother, it’s just that Alfie wasn’t there with us. “It was hard because the first time we had a beautul boy and we lost him. “Then when we had Thomas there were tears of joy, but it felt dferent because we had lost our first boy. “We were the same parents Alfie had at home, just in a dferent position, more tense. “ We still speak about Alfie, but we don’t speak about the hospital. We talk about how he is going to help save a lot of children in the future.”  Tom tearfully told how he gave Alfie mouth-to-mouth as his le ebbed away in the early hours of April  last year. With tears rolling down his cheeks Tom said: “I think about that moment every day. That moment is forever in my head. “I was giving him mouth-to-mouth, I could hear him breathing, like a sigh. It gave me more encouragement to keep trying. The noises kept coming and coming. But Kate was saying ‘Stop it, you’re just expanding his belly’. I didn’t want to stop. But I knew he was dead. At the very last moment his colour went. “The police and doctors and nurses were looking through the door, standing there. “I said to them ‘Can’t you do anything ’ They pulled his le support out and thought he would die in three to four minutes. But he lived for five days. We put him on our knees and sang to him, cuddled him.   “I said right to the end that their treatment of him was shyinhumane. “I do feel bad for the nurses because they didn’t have the power. All they could do was stand and watch for five days while oxygen and food was withheld. Up until the last I thought we were going to save him. I tried every avenue. “I was just a dad who wanted the best for his son.” Alfie was born in May  and while initially healthy he fell seriously ill at six months old. He was in Alder Hey Hospital for the last  months of his le. Doctors found he had the rare brain condition GABA transaminase deficiency. They said there was nothing more they could do and advised that Alfie should be allowed to slip away. A court agreed – prompting Tom and Kate’s long battle to overturn the decision, in the hope that Alfie could be taken abroad for le-saving treatment. They appealed to UK and European judges and Tom even met Pope Francis, who backed the couple. But ultimately the courts ruled Alfie’s le support could be switched off. Tom said he and Kate still see grief and bereavement counsellors as they strive for the best way forward. And he is determined to stay strong. He added: “We are still understanding how to grieve. “I want to be more happy around Thomas, I don’t want him to see me crying all the time or with a bad face. “He needs a happy environment. I need to understand how to be happy.” Alfies legacy to help other seriously ill kids Alfies dad Tom says a pound, fund raised in his name will now help other seriously ill children. The sum came from an “Alfie’s Army” fundraising page set up during the legal battle to pay for potentially le-saving treatment in Italy or Poland. Hundreds of supporters also joined demonstrations in support of Alfie. The family has applied for charity status and has already provided wheelchairs and sensory equipment for disabled children. Tom said: “When we get something we think ‘Alfie bought it for them, Alfie is helping that person’. We’re happy that his name can live on in other parents’ and children’s minds.” The Alfie’s Army page states: “We don’t want any other family going through what we have... we are hoping to open a foundation to help other families get the help they need.” "},{"url":null,"title":"amber peats grandmother reveals last","story":"NewsAmber Peats grandmother reveals last gt tragic teen gave her before she diedEXCLUSIVE: Jenner Lancaster says her granddaughter Amber was let down by everyone before she was found hangedShareCommentsByGrace Macaskill :,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsJenner Lancaster has blasted social services in two counties for failing to help her granddaughter before her tragic death \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is the last gt her granddaughter gave her on the final day she saw her alive. And shyJenner Lancaster keeps it safe in a trinket box of memories. A Mother’s Day card from a tragic, troubled girl whose harrowing le was last week laid bare in a coroner’s court. Two years after that fleeting visit to her gran, Amber Peat was found hanged after running away from the last of the  homes her parents had moved her to. She was just . On Friday coroner Laurinda Bower ed a narrative conclusion on the youngster’s death, saying she could not be sure she intended to commit suicide. But she blasted education, health and social care agencies in two counties for missing  chances to save the tormented child. And she panned the girl’s mum and stepdad for showing “very little,any, consideration” for her welfare. “This is proof the authorities failed Amber,” says a tearful Jenner, , tenderly touching that treasured card. “She was let down by everyone. But it doesn’t change the outcome does it  Amber was a little girl crying out for help and nobody listened. How must she have been feeling in those final moments  “I’m sure she would have opened up to meshe hadn’t been forced to move away.”   The inquest heard allegations that Amber – whose body was found in woods near her home – suffered emotional abuse, and that her stepdad Danny “humiliated” her and gave her “severe punishments”. A teacher claimed the Cinderella schoolgirl told her the family’s dog was treated better than her. A policewoman told the court her mum Kelly dismissed her disappearance as just “attention seeking”. Today, her gran reveals how Kelly banned her from seeing Amber after that last visit on Mother’s Day, . Jenner’s son Adrian,  – Amber’s real dad – had split from Kelly in Christmas  after a turbulent -year relationship.  He has a conviction for domestic violence against her. “He’s no angel,” says Jenner. “But there’s no excuse for Kelly to have stopped Amber’s contact with me. It was cold and cruel. “Amber said she couldn’t stay long that day as her mum and Danny were waiting in the car. “I texted Kelly a couple of weeks later to askI could see her. I got a reply saying she wasn’t sure, then the whole family just up and left. When I called Kelly’s number she’d changed it. Her old neighbours had no idea where they’d gone. My heart was broken. “Amber was so loving. She spent weekends with me and every time she went home she’d leave notes saying things like ‘love you, Nanna’.”  Jenner was at the inquest every day, hoping to make sense of what happened. “I owed it to Amber,” she says. Nottingham Coroner’s Court heard how Amber had moved house “no less than  times” around Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. And social services in Derbyshire were already involved with the Peat family when they moved to Mansfield, Notts, in . When Amber started the local Queen Elizabeth school, staff there quickly grew worried. She told teachers her stepdad Danny would wake her at .pm to clean floors for two hours as punishment for failing to do chores. She said he made her wear baggy grey jogging bottoms to school and carry her belongings in a plastic bag instead of a satchel or backpack to humiliate her. He denied it. Form teacher Rebecca Beard told the inquest: “Amber said her dad wanted to get everyone to laugh at her.” The distraught schoolgirl told another teacher – after briefly running away from home in April  – that the family dog was treated better than her.  Six months before her death she wrapped a school tie around her neck and told pupils: “I hate my le. I want to kill myself.” Teachers twice tipped off Nottinghamshire social workers but were told that her case did not “cross the threshold” for intervention. Coroner Bower said Amber’s tragic death highlighted the lack of sharing of information between agencies in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. She said: “No one got to the point of how Amber was feeling because there was not that support in place.” Amber, who had two siblings, was found dead in June  after a row over cleaning a cool box after a family holiday in Cornwall. It was almost eight hours before Kelly, , and Danny, , reported her missing, after going shopping, out for dinner and to a carwash. Both denied all the allegations made at the inquest.  Now Jenner, who lives in Nottinghamshire, is left with that trinket box and a conviction that more could have been done to save her granddaughter. “How could Amber’s cries for help have gone unheard ” she says. “People will say ‘lessons have been learned’ but it won’t bring her back.” She is surrounded by pictures of Amber – as a baby, as a three-year-old playing by a duck pond, as a young girl nearing teens, posing elegantly. Jenner shows me a Christmas decoration Amber made from lollipop sticks. All the time she holds a green stone keyring Amber gave her. “It’s only a cheap thing she won at a fair, but it means everything to me. It’s one of the few things I have left of her.” Jenner says. Amber harboured dreams of being a model. “She loved having her picture taken and every time she came she’d get my make-up out to do herself up.”  But the vulnerable girl also yearned for her lost childhood. A youth worker who had sessions with Amber told the inquest her mother “laughed” at a letter her vulnerable daughter wrote saying she just wanted to be a little girl again. After the inquest verdict on Friday, Kelly said she had been had been “the best parent” she could. Jenner says: “Amber did everything she could to get help. She spoke to teachers, wrote to her mum, had youth worker sessions yet despite all of this a house move meant she fell off the radar.” All Jenner has left now is the memory of that last big hug before Amber left that Mother’s Day, out of her le forever. “I think about her from when I wake until I close my eyes. I have happy dreams in which I believe she comes to visit me. “I like to think it means Amber is finally at peace.” Scandal of lost chancesJan : Amber referred to Derbyshire social services by family’s GP. She runs away from home twice. No family assessment done. June : The Peats move to Notts. Amber’s file is not passed on.

Chanel is five today and has defied all the odds to be here at all. She made history as the youngest child in the world to have open heart surgery – MINUTES after being born. Doctors had given her just a five per cent chance of survival. Mum Fay, , says: “We had been told there was little chance of our daughter making it and were twice offered a termination. “But look at her now – Chanel’s proved over and over again what a little miracle she is. We still have to pinch ourselves that she is here and doing as well as she is. It’s like a dream come true that Chanel is celebrating her fth birthday.”  The youngster is spending today with family and friends at a kids’ play centre with a special guest appearance from her idol – Disney character Rapunzel. And she has been looking forward to that, telling the Sunday Mirror: “I’m excited that I will be five. I’m going to have a cake and a princess party with all my friends and play in the ball pit.” Proud Fay, from Seaham, County Durham, adds: “To see our little girl running around, doing what other five-year-olds do, is amazing. I’ve lost count of how many times we nearly lost her, so to see her so happy and healthy is the greatest gt we could ask for.” Chanel entered the Guinness Book of Records after her lesaving surgery moments after birth – and has had  operations.  She has survived a cardiac arrest, a stroke that resulted in cerebral palsy and a le-threatening seizure that has left her with epilepsy. Fay was  weeks into her pregnancy when she and HGV driver husband, Michael, , were told Chanel had hypoplastic left heart syndrome. It means the left ventricle in her heart is severely underdeveloped and only half of children with the condition reach the age of five. A further complication emerged before Chanel was born – intact atrial septum was weakening her tiny heart even further.  Doctors asked Fay and Michael whether they wanted a termination. But Fay, who also has two sons – Chase, nine, and Cole, six – said No. The clincher came during a scan on which Chanel seemed to give a thumbs-up. Fay recalls: “I could feel her kicking and I was sure it was her way of saying ‘I can do this, don’t give up’.” Chanel was born by Caesarean in February  in a cardiac operating theatre at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. Surgeons were ready to operate immediately. Stay-at-home mum Fay says: “I didn’t even get chance to hold my little girl before she was whisked away and her chest opened up in an adjoining theatre.  “It was touch-and-go and specialists warned us there was a very high chance Chanel wouldn’t make it through the surgery. And evenshe did she may never leave hospital and would eventually need a heart transplant. “Although terried, I refused to dwell on the negatives and kept telling myself my tiny little fighter was going to make it.” Which is exactly what Chanel did – and she is now the oldest known British survivor with her two conditions. She has endured open heart surgery another three times, surviving a cardiac arrest after the second procedure when she was just seven days old. Chanel was so heavily sedated that it was only when she came home that it emerged she had suffered a stroke and couldn’t move the left side of her body. It left Chanel unable to walk until she was two-and-a-half and she still wears a splint on her left leg. She now needs  doses of medication daily to prevent heart failure, prevent blood clotting and to manage her epilepsy.  She is tube fed through her tummy and has liver and kidney problems due to the lack of oxygen circulating around her body. And Fay, seen right with a Pride of Britain special recognition award for fundraising to help other sick children, knows Chanel will fall ill again. But she and Michael give her every opportunity to lead as normal a le as possible. She adds: “At some point she will go into heart failure or suffer another cardiac arrest and will need an urgent heart transplant. It could be tomorrow – it could be  years. We have no idea. “Before Chanel’s last open-heart surgery in August , she was so weak she could only walk a couple of steps and couldn’t even finish a full sentence without gasping for breath.  “Her lips were permanently purple and she spent weeks just lying on the couch with no energy whatsoever. But since the surgery, she is like a dferent child. “Chanel started mainstream school last September, and although she only manages mornings, she loves nothing more than playing with her friends and gets up every morning full of beans. “Chanel has constant one-to-one support enabling her to go to school, which is an absolute blessing after everything she has been through. “We are acutely aware that every day with her is incredibly precious. We have no idea what the future holds. “So as Chanel celebrates her birthday, we count our blessings in awe of her feisty spirit and sheer determination – and look forward to what the future holds.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"britains richest man could end","story":"NewsopinionBritains richest man could end homelessness - instead hes moving abroadJim Ratclfe is moving to Monaco - this perfectly legal operation will cost the Treasury at least £million, cash that would end the scandal of people living on the streetsShareCommentsByPaul Routledge:,  FEB NewsopinionThe homeless suffer in our cities while Jim Ratclfe has raced to move his assets offshore \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is a tale of two shyBritains,  style, lost in the vicious clamour over Brexit.

Sir Jim Ratclfe, the country’s richest man, worth an estimated poundbillion, is moving to Monaco with enormous amounts of tax-free money.

Closer to home, Tanya’s stepdad is showing similar resolve as he, too, faces the same issues. Tanya, who plays Rainie Cross in the BBC soap, said: “I have a family member who has Alzheimer’s. We’re dealing with that. “My stepfather will be in my sights, so will Barbara. “It’s a severely underfunded disease. We don’t know enough about it. The awareness has leapt this year and that’s got a lot to do with Barbara.” Scott Mitchell,  – hubby of TV’s much-loved Barbara,  – is also running the marathon.  And he and Tanya will be joined by a right collection of Cockneys in the form of EastEnders stars Adam Woodyatt, Jake Wood, Emma Barton, Natalie Cassidy, Kellie Shirley, Jamie Borthwick and Jane Slaughter. Training for the event has kept Tanya occupied while not playing TV’s Rainie. She and her character could barely be more dferent. Rainie is a former druggie and Tanya is teetotal and enjoys a quiet le with her partner James Barriscale in Kent. Her powerful performances as Rainie have touched families who have been ravaged by addiction. “Somebody recently came up to me in the street and said a family member of theirs had been going through a similar situation,” she told.  “As a family they’ve clocked into Rainie and over the years she’s been a formative character for them. Particularly when she was going through the crack addiction. Their family member was going through the same thing and they would watch Rainie. We have a social responsibility to tell the stories.” Tanya first set foot in Albert Square more than  years ago and loves every minute. The London-born star – who was seen last week at the West End version of Only Fools And Horses – had a special word to say about another EastEnders veteran, -year-old June Brown, who plays Dot Cotton. Tanya said: “June is wonderful. She’s still playing that iconic character. She comes on set with all the same ethics she’s ever had. Her integrity towards the work is absolutely paramount. She’s an inspiration to me and it’s an honour to work with her.” And Tanya also heaped praise on another inspirational actress – Olivia Colman, , who played Queen Anne in The Favourite and is up for the best actress award at tonight’s Oscars. The pair starred in Broadchurch together.   Tanya said: “I watched the filmwhen I was in LA. She’s amazing in it. I was mesmerised by her. I sent her a message straight after. “She’s not a showbiz person. She’s down to earth and fantastic at her job. It’s fantastic she’s being recognised. It’s encouraging as it reminds you it’s possible and that dreams do come true.” But Tanya doesn’t have any visions of Hollywood stardom herself. She added: “Rainie challenges me right across the gamut. There’s drama and comedy. I’m learning from her. If Rainie keeps challenging me like this I’m happy to stay.”To support the Barbaras Revolutionairies Alzheimers London Marathon team, click here .Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at webcelebs@trinitymirror or call us direct   .

Take up a new exerciseResearchers at Australia’s University of Canberra found that regular aerobic exercise dramatically improved cognitive abilities such as thinking, reading, learning and reasoning.Studies at the University of Edinburgh also found people doing more physical activity had less brain shrinkage. Even those who have done little exercise before the age of  can enjoy the benefits almost immediately.  Imaging studies also found new activities exercise large parts of the brain’s cortex and increase levels of activity in several areas. This activity decreases when the task becomes automatic and shyroutine. So change things here and there. Have a shower at a dferent time, watch a dferent news story, or go for a walk. Take up an instrument Learning to play a musical instrument not only boosts creativity and the ability to focus, it can lower the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment by more than a third, says a study at the University of Calornia. Flex your mental muscle Your brain is just like any other muscle, so give it a good workout and it will stay strong. Brain-training puzzles and apps such as those made by Peak Games have been scientically proven to increase cognition and everyday ing. A new study of  adults, shyconducted at the City University of New York, showed that those who used brain-training apps regularly for eight weeks had increased mental cognition. Michael Merzenich, a neuroscientist at the University of Calornia, San Francisco, has developed a computer-based training regimen to speed up how the brain processes information.The Brain Fitness Program works with language and hearing to improve speed and accuracy. It starts by asking you to shydistinguish between sounds, such as dog and bog, at an increasingly faster rate. Merzenich likens it to a tennis coach firing balls at you faster and faster over the course of the summer to keep you challenged. Brain-boost your diet The Global Council on Brain Health revealed in  that what is good for your heart is good for your brain. This means a diet rich in berries, leafy greens, olive oils, nuts and seeds. Fruit, low-fat dairy, poultry and grains are also good. A list of what to avoid includes fried foods, pastries, red meat and salt.   Memory mineralsStudies at King’s College, London , and the University of Rochester in New York showed a low iron intake can have a bad effect on IQ levels and cognitive .A lack of iron causes low haemoglobin levels, which affect the supply of oxygen to the brain. An iron-rich drink such as Spatone can replace iron missing from the diet. Deficiency of zinc, found in peanuts, shellfish and whole grains, can also interfere with memory. Taking a supplement of -mg daily can help.

Emma’s specialist training enables her to carry out a range of tasks for the eight-year-old — she is even shylearning to help her get her coat on. And the loyal helper has now been named a finalist in the Friends for Le competition at next month’s Crufts. Emma, who landed her role through the charity Dogs for Good, can also hunt out Milli’s medicated drinks when she loses them — and gives soothing “head rests” when the youngster gets out of breath and anxious. As well as Down’s syndrome, Milli has a serious heart condition and has already had open heart surgery twice, the first time at just four months.   Dad Steve, , and mum Christina, , a teacher, found Dogs for Good while researching what help was shyout there for children with disabilities. The charity is the first UK assistance dog organisation to give aid to youngsters like Milli. Steve, of Upminster, Essex, said: “It’s like Emma turned a light on for Milli and has given her the confidence to shine as brightly in the wider world as she does at home. “At her sister’s recent Pony Club awards ceremony, I was amazed to see Milli chatting to people and shyintroducing her to ‘my Emma’. “Prior to getting Emma she would have been very quiet and not wanted to interact at all.” He said after first being introduced to Emma by the charity, Milli had told him: “I liked that dog, Daddy. She didn’t bark. She’s fluffy and lovely.”  Hairdresser Steve added: “As far as I was concerned that was it – the seal of approval. “As soon as Milli is home from school she piles in for a big cuddle with Emma and spends lots of time talking to her and stroking her, which really helps to bring down her anxiety.” Emma has now been with the family for just over a year. The Friends for Le competition celebrates people’s relationships with their dogs, both in their role as “man’s best friend” and the support they give many owners in the face of adversity.

It had little hearts all over it so maybe she had met her prince by then, he said. Richard said Meghan was not like other driven, ambitious actresses and instead seemed very down to earth.

He also said she fancied her own make-up line and was in talks for a deal with QVC.He told The Sun on Sunday: I used to hold a bracelet and her phone - she loved me to hold her phone - to read her energy, and we just talked.

He was born breech, which is buttocks first, at around .pm. The mum was told that an air ambulance had been called however it would be a while until it arrived. During this time, the mum described the moment before she was sent away as being filled with confusion, questions and lack of decisions. A doctor and two nurses eventually arrived by police car from Inverness to take care of the first twin.

The -year-old, fromNewquay, initially went to her doctor with fatigue and heavy bleeding after an abortion in  aged , but claims she was misdiagnosed as having an abnormal period.  Demi explained: “At first I was misdiagnosed. They said that it was abnormal period and thought it would be sorted with contraception. “After  months, I found out I had CIN  and have been struggling with it since.” CIN  is caused by human papillomavirusand treatment to remove them is usually recommended. Demi was diagnosed aged  and she has not been able to have a smear test since. She said: “I saw a gynaecologist, who immediately booked me in for an operation to remove pre-cancerous cells. “I’ve been going back and forth from the hospital, having procedures. “In the last four years I’ve been on three tablets a day for two years, biopsies nearly every month, three procedures on my cervix where they removed the pre-cancerous and cancerous cells.”  The minimum age to get a cervical screening in the UK is currently , and is justied by the fact that cervical cancer is very rare below that age and that it is common to have abnormalities which usually go away by themselves. Due to the dferent operations that Demi has had over the years, she was told that there was a high chance that she could not have a child. She explained: “For the last two years I have massively struggled due to the fact I was advised I may not be able to conceive and thatthe speed and continuous spreading carried on a hysterectomy would be on the cards. “I am now nearly  weeks pregnant but in those  weeks I’ve had a trip to Treliske every two weeks to check my cervix , midwe appointments nearly every two weeks, consultation appointments and prenatal appointments. “It’s going well but I have to go to the hospital every week. The operations were to remove parts of the cervix and that’s what made it dficult. My cervix is too short. I could have had a premature baby, a miscarriage, etc.”   She said that she wants to share her story to make sure young women or teenagers do not experience what she has gone through. “I’m , still not the legal age for a smear but yet have suffered massively and my family have as well seeing me go through this,” she said. “I need to try and tell my story because more woman need to realise a smear isn’t the scary bit - it’s what can happen after. “The minimum age should be lowered orgirls go to the doctor and ask, they should be offered the test. “Both of my younger sisters have been to the doctor’s as soon as they were  due to all the complications that I’ve had. “You just have to push and push. When you’re a teenager you know your body. If it doesn’t seem right, you have to ask to be tested.” Demi is a tattoo model and she says she uses her photo shoots for magazines to raise awareness as much as she can and do campaigns.  She said: “Smear tests should be offered earlier and it’s about getting more girls to do it. “I raise awareness any way I can. We’ve got to help each other when it comes to smear test and cervical cancer. “Hospital staff is amazing, everyone is so, so good and they are mostly women so they understand what you’re going through. I’ve found that taking my mother and my grandmother helps.” In , ministers rejected calls for the screening age for cervical cancer to be lowered, arguing that doing so would cause  positive results and would lead to people receiving unnecessary – and potentially harmful – treatment. According to the NHS, the symptoms of cervical cancer are unusual vaginal bleeding during or after sex, between your periods or after the menopause, pain during sex, unusual vaginal discharge and pain in the lower back or pelvis. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papillomavirus , and there are effective vaccines that can protect people from contracting HPV. The vaccines, however, cannot treat existing infections.

She said: I tried to tell doctors that something wasnt right. Obviously Id had a successful pregnancy with my first son but after that, every pregnancy afterwards left me with no energy at all, I was so ill. But after suffering my fourth miscarriage - the last while I was carrying twins - I was just told I needed God on my side and to just keep trying. She added: One night, I was sitting on couch watching a Welsh farming programme when the vet, Cen Williams was talking about how he had noticed more dead calves than usual.   The ones that were born alive were very lethargic and were taking a long time to get up. The vet said it was because of a lack of iodine in the soil which had been washed away due to the rain. This had caused thyroid problems in cows. I knew I had a thyroid problem and it wasnt being monitored well enough. The cows were given an iodine and thyroxine boost and were much better and more calves were being born alive. I sat up and thought thats whats wrong with me.   The programme spurred Lowri to seek fresh medical help and demand further tests. She also took to the internet to carry out her own research and started cooking with a special salt containing iodine. Her determination saw her referred to a thyoid specialist and she was given thyroxine every two weeks when she fell pregnant with her second son, Gwil who was born in . Lowri added: Falling pregnant wasnt the problem for me, it was keeping the baby that was the issue, but once I started having thyroxine, I was full of le and felt so much better.  I just knew that pregnancy would go full term. I honestly thinkI hadnt seen the programme, Gwil wouldnt be here today. God knows how many more miscarriages I would have had. Now Lowri feels that more should be done to help couples who suffer repeated miscarriages and is calling for support from the Welsh Government. The young peoples mentor for the homeless prevention team, Gorwel within Grwp Cynefin said: The more I got angry and demanded tests, the more they were listening, but it shouldnt have to be that way.   Im a strong believer that you know your own body and I knew I wasnt just feeling tired because of the pregnancies, there was more to it than that. But why did I have to lose five babies before being sent for tests when all of this could have been prevented  I also think there needs to be somewhere for people to talk about miscarriage. My first was a nightmare, I was in bed for three days, I bled heavily and nobody phoned to check up on me.   By the time Id gone through it four times, I gave up my job as a high school pupils mentor in Ruthin because of my mental state. I was on a hamster wheel of getting pregnant, miscarrying and going back to work. I didnt really have time to grieve in three years. When Gwil arrived, I couldnt bare to leave him so I took on a house restoration project and it was the best thing I ever did. I recharged my batteries, had some me time, time to think and time to grieve and now Im back in a job I enjoy that makes me appreciate what Ive got.

Yesterday the -year-olds dream came true after warplanes from Britain and the United States staged a fly-past to honour the th anniversary of the crash, which happened in . Tony was just eight-years-old when he witnessed the fatal crash in Endclfe Park in Sheffield, as the pilots attempted to steer clear of him and his friends. He has been diligently maintaining a memorial for the crew of the B- Flying Fortress, known as Mi Amigo, which sits in the same park. And following yesterdays emotional fly-past, the pensioner today travelled his usual seven miles, on foot and by bus, from his home to the memorial.  However, any plans the -year-old had to perform any essential maintenance to the memorial on the crash site, where he spends six days a week, were dashed by a constant stream of well-wishers hugging him, shaking his hand and asking for selfies as they congratulated him on Fridays spectacular event. Many of those stopping to talk to Mr Foulds in the Saturday sunshine echoed growing calls for the pensioner to be honoured by the Queen for his dedication to the Mi Amigos crew. Mr Foulds was eight when the badly-damaged bomber limped over the roofs of nearby houses and crashed into a wooded area, apparently to avoid him and his friends who were fighting on the grass. He has since dedicated his le to the crew, believing he was responsible for their deaths. However, scores of people who stopped to talk to him on Saturday morning urged him to stop feeling guilty.One elderly man said to Mr Foulds: You need to stop this talk of feeling guilty.   It was the Germans who killed those men, not you. You were a kid. It wasnt your fault. Another shook him briskly by the hand and said: You deserve a knighthood. Itll be travestythey dont give you one. Mr Foulds said: Its just amazing. Theyve not stopped just coming up and shaking my hand. I had a letter from an American this morning. It said this proves what weve always thought, that you Brits do love us. The flypast, which included fighters from the United States Air Force and the RAF, was broadcast around the world and watched by a massive crowd in the park which has been estimated at , people.  Clear skies meant that the assembled audience were able to perfectly see the tribute to the men, who were limping back from a bombing raid in Denmark on the day of the fateful crash. Mr Foulds broke down in tears after the names of the dead men were read out at the salute. The event to mark the th anniversary of the crash followed a campaign by BBC Breakfasts Dan Walker, who bumped into Mr Foulds while walking his dog in the park last month. Walker, who is currently in Tanzania preparing to climb Mount Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief, is now leading the calls for the pensioner to be officially recognised.He posted on Twitter : The next step is getting Tony an honour from the Queen.

It is rather poor social climbing.  “The moment she met Harry she cut everybody off who she thought might be no longer desirable in her friend and family circle. It is extraordinary behaviour, we will see how it all plays out.”The Sunday People bumped into Piers, , at The Beverly Hilton Hotel where he and Susanna Reid, , will host GMB live from the Oscars tomorrow.Last year’s awards were dominated by sex abuse claims but Piers says this year’s will be dferent. “I think it is much better this year where you have a ceremony which has gone back to celebrating movies,” he says. “That is the point of the Oscars.  “When we had all the stars turning out on the red carpet in black because of Time’s Up, it felt to me like it was slightly ruining everything. “The whole point of this was to be a big, happy, jolly celebration of the industry, and the scandals were what they were.” Piers is keen to interview film boss Harvey Weinstein, , who is fighting sex abuse claims. “He has been at the centre of the scandal from pretty much the start. We haven’t heard his side of the story yet really in any depth and he has not had to be put under the spotlight.” Piers adds: “Hollywood is a corrupt, amoral, place. However, it is always great fun.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rachael bletchly teach kids make","story":"NewsopinionRachael Bletchly: Teach kids to make do and mend  \"\"Seams\" like a top ideaMPs have the right idea — its high time we stopped buying new clothes and remembered the value of the sewing kitShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  FEB NewsopinionChildren should be taught the skills that will encourage them not to chuck clothing away but mend them instead \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI’ve got a sewing kit in my drawer at work and it feels like I’m the shyoffice seamstress. Colleagues come over with missing shybuttons, split trousers and droopy hems. I once darned the boss’s cashmere jumper so he wouldn’t chuck it out. Because I learned to stitch and sew at my mother’s knee. She was a child of the Second World War when Britain was taught how to Make Do And Mend. Clothing was rationed so shyfactories and workers were free to make unorms. The government issued a booklet advising housewives, school kids and Boy Scouts how to repair and revive worn-out togs.   And a cartoon character called Mrs Sew and Sew gave handy tips on shyturning collars, darning socks, fixing moth holes and even making undies out of off-ration “butter muslin”. I still have the wartime thimble my gran, mum and aunts used, and remember being taught the slogan “a neat darn is a real badge of honour”. So I’m heartened that MPs are urging schools to start teaching kids “the joy” of mending again, to tackle the environmental damage caused by “fast fashion”. One million tons of clothing are thrown away every year in the UK, with , tons going to landfill or incineration. High street brands and online stores selling pound T-shirts and dresses for a fiver mean some items are worn once then binned.   And each year the average Brit buys a full suitcase-worth of new shyshygear — more than anywhere  in Europe. The Commons environmental audit committee has called for a p levy on every item of clothing sold, to raise poundmillion a year for shycollection and recycling. But MPs also want lessons in school on “designing, creating, mending and repairing clothes”. They think it will also give shyanxious teens a creative outlet.   Mary Creagh, the Labour chair, said: “Fashion shouldn’t cost the earth. Our insatiable appetite for clothes comes with a huge social and shyenvironmental price tag. “Children should be taught the joy of making and mending clothes in school as an antidote to anxiety and the mental health crisis. “And consumers must play their part by buying less, mending, renting and sharing more.” It’s a darn good idea.

And Shamima’s family are now asking for him to be brought to Britain while she stays in a Syrian refugee camp awaiting her fate. Shamima’s sister Renu has appealed for Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s help to get him into the UK, describing her nephew as “the one true innocent in this debacle”. Well, she’s half right. The baby clearly IS an innocent, but so are all the children brutally murdered by the vile death cult Shamima still admires – including ones killed in Manchester by the suicide bombing that she justied as “retaliation”.   As mothers go, she’s not a great prospect. So the question now is, should this baby be separated from her and raised by her family  Those who back this course of action say the baby will have a better start in le in the UK. Well, he’ll clearly be in a healthier environment, but key for me is that he would be without his mother. And we should never underestimate the trauma babies can suffer when separated from mothers. I speak as someone who adopted a baby from an orphanage when she was days old. My daughter Amara was abandoned by her birth mother so she never had a choice. For now, she’s a happy, healthy, entirely normal seven-year-old. But what I was told by the experts overseeing our adoption about the damage done to such babies was deeply worrying.   It was made very clear that no matter how secure and loving our home, a child separated from its birth mother will grow up with a sense of loss and with questions we will have to answer one day. Every parent who adopts a child needs to be prepared to provide the right information, delivered using the right language. They also need to know when to get professional help. The research is pretty clear. Myron Hofer, developmental psychology director at New York’s Columbia University, found early separation can “contribute to a complex, changing pattern of vulnerability over the le span”. So unless Shamima’s baby is in immediate danger, he should stay with her. Poverty and displacement are endured by many in this world who survive because they have family around them. We can’t take away kids based on our personal views. Otherwise we’d put them in care because the parents think homosexuality is a sin, or that hanging should be brought back. This child is Shamima’s best chance of wanting to change. As a mum, I know that a child can help you become a better person. At , she’s seen a great deal of brutality and pain. Soshe reconnects with love and compassion she might just begin to see where she went wrong.

At  stone, three pounds, he is more than twice the average weight for his age after scoffing mountains of junk food. Now his mum is begging doctors to give him a pound, NHS gastric bypass. That is because Donna — who herself once weighed  stone — had the same operation last year. The -year-old ambulance worker said the procedure helped her to shed st and she now weighs less than her son. “People might criticise me for wanting to put my child through major surgery but I know from my own experience that it will change his le,” she said. During the procedure, the top part of the stomach is joined to the small intestine, so you feel fuller soon and you don’t absorb as many calories through food.   Ben, who is ft in tall, is bullied over his weight and lacks the willpower to diet. He said: “The bullying makes me feel bad. I want a gastric bypass like my mum. “Even though it would take a while to recover, I think it would be worth it and I could go on my bike with my friends.” Donna, from Havant, Hants, said: “I’ve broken down in tears in the doctor’s surgery because he really needs help. “A gastric bypass is major surgery but will be worth it. “Willpower is a big problem with Ben. He’s asked for slimming shakes but they’ll leave him hungry and he’ll give up. “If I could turn back time, I wouldn’t have let him eat so much junk. “I always apologise to him for letting him become the way he is as I blame myself.   “I’ve tried to push him into rugby and football but he would rather come home and play the Xbox.” Ben ate normally until he was four when Donna split with his dad and he started to have tantrumsshe didn’t ply him with chips, pasta and biscuits. “He would lob the plate across the roomhe didn’t like what was on there,” she said. “He was a chicken nugget machine. I would only give him about four at first. As he got older, his appetite would increase and he was always saying he was hungry. “I tried giving him smaller portions but half an hour later, he’d be raiding the cupboards for biscuits. I do wish I hadn’t given in now.”   She added: “I’ve been told I need to cut things down and be strict with him but he has behavioural issues and I need a house left standing. “I can’t constantly be decorating because he is lobbing a plate across the room. “He has all the signs of ADHD including poor concentration but he’s never been diagnosed. “I’m always being told it’s a parenting issue. I ask myselfI’m a bad parent. But I always come down on him like a ton of bricks over right and wrong.” Bullies teased Ben when they saw his mum at the school gates. Donna explained: “Ben was coming home upset as he was being taunted. People would say, ‘You are getting as fat as your mum’.   “It would destroy me. Some nights, I’d sit here in tears but I would use food as a comfort and he picked up on it. She could munch her way through  bags of crisps after a huge helping of pasta and chips. “I would watch telly nibbling crisps to try to make myself feel happier and he’d say, ‘You do it mum, why can’t I ’” Donna was  stone by the time she was  — and being bullied made her eat more. She said: “I was always called ‘fat cow’ walking down the road, and told boys would never have me because I’m fat. “I was terrible for eating in secret. I’d stuff my face silly at mates’ houses so my mum wouldn’t know.” At , when she fell pregnant with Ben, she was so heavy her st scales couldn’t hold her weight. Donna tried the Atkins Diet, which saw her shed st, but doctors warned it was affecting her kidneys.   She said: “I starved myself for a week once because I was so sick of Ben being bullied but I had no energy and I was no good for him. Stuck at st, she asked seven doctors to refer her for a gastric bypass before she was finally accepted last April. The op has left her feeling “ecstatic”. “I woke up from the operation and, for the first time ever, I had no interest in food,” she said. “The weight started falling off. People I’ve known for years don’t recognise me in the street. “Now, I’m stuffedI eat a Weetabix so I know it would be a godsend for Ben. I’ve been asking doctors to give him the operation for two years. “I don’t want him getting diabetes, or heart disease. But most of all I just don’t want him to have the miserable le I had for years.” Ben wants to join the police or the army when he leaves school and Donna believes the op would encourage him to be more active. She said: “He can’t join the police or the armyhe can’t run. “If I can get him down weight wise, he will enjoy sport more and won’t have kids taking the mickey and running round the pitch like a lump of lard. “I still give him treats, like a bag of popcorn on a Friday night, but I ration them.”   On a typical day, Ben’s breakfast is Weetabix, toast and scrambled eggs. Lunch is a ham sandwich and dinner spaghetti bolognese or pasta bake with chips. He no longer snacks through ten biscuits, a bowl of ice cream and a big bag of microwave popcorn each day. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the NHS gave children weight loss surgery onlytheir conditions were le threatening. “The child’s mum has done very well to lose this weight but it is not a good idea for the child to have bariatric surgery,” he said. “A child is still growing andyou have a gastric bypass you are severely limiting the food which that child needs in order to grow. “People might say it’s better to be thin and small but the body should be allowed to grow to its full, natural size. “The mother should hang off for a few years, all the time doing her utmost to keep him off the junk food he has been eating. “He will also need psychiatric counselling because the child has eaten too much fast food all of his le and will have a yearning to continue after a gastric bypass. “That will be ruinous because it might upset the bypass. He is not of an age to appreciate how crucial it is that he should amend his lestyle. “It’s less likely he’ll have the mental capacity to moderate his eating practices.”   Kids getting fat busting surgery at  Obese children as young as  are undergoing weight-loss surgery on the NHS.

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: “There are children who are so fat that when they go to bed they roll over and lie on their airways and suffocate. “It is obese kids with le-threatening conditions like this who are having bariatric surgery. “Normally children of that age will not be given bariatric surgery because they are still growing.

Ice calving is where an iceberg breaks away from the edge of a larger body of ice is is a natural process that regularly happens. Another recent example was the  calving of a Delaware-sized iceberg from the Larsen C ice shelf that broke away from the Antarctic Peninsula.   But the calving at Antarctica’s Brunt Ice Shelf is unusual as NASA say that the region was originally thought of as stable. However the crack has been growing at a rate of around . miles per year. Pictures from NASAs Operational Land Imager show how the crack has grown eastwards from an area dubbed the McDonald Ice Rumples. In a statement, the space agency said: It is not yet clear how the remaining ice shelf will respond following the break, posing an uncertain future for scientic infrastructure and a human presence on the shelf that was first established in .  “The rumples are due to the way ice flows over an underwater formation, where the bedrock rises high enough to reach into the underside of the ice shelf. “This rocky formation impedes the flow of ice and causes pressure waves, crevasses, and rts to form at the surface.” The latest crack has led to concerns about the Halley Research Station, which is run by the British Antarctic Survey. Usually the base runs year-round, but the “unpredictable changes” to the ice has meant it has had to shut down twice over the last few years.   Chris Shuman, a glaciologist with NASA, said in a statement: “The likely future loss of the ice on the other side of the Halloween Crack suggests that more instability is possible, with associated risk to Halley VI.”A spokesperson from the BAS told Newsweek that the safety of its staff is the top priority and they are constantly monitoring the movement of the ice.She said: Our most recenthigh-resolution synthetic aperture radar image showed that the rate of widening of the crack does appear to have increased since mid-January, but not enough to cause alarm, she said. The station is designed to be relocatable. In  BAS successfully relocated the station’s eight modules kmupstream of a previously dormant ice chasm.

Violent scenes saw forces loyal to Nicolaacutes Maduro open fire at the Colombian-Brazilian border after the president ordered them to block humanitarian aid entering the country.In Santa Elena de Guairen four people were shot dead and  injured after irregular pro-government militias known as colectivos opened fire, according to Foro Penal, a legal non-profit group that tracks violence in Venezuela.The group’s director, Alfredo Romero said: “We’ve been told colectivos shot at people at the border and the situation is grave. Shocking security footage taken at the Venezula-Colombia border shows chaos at Francisco de Paula Santander bridge as people scrambled to grab supplies from a truck while Venezuelan riot police shot tear gas at them.   Demonstrators clashed with Venezuelas security forces at the bridge, near the town of Urena, Venezuela, which was one of three across which Guaido was hoping to pass much-needed food and medicine. Medics were also treated civilians near the Simoacuten Boliacute for tear gas inhalation and injuries sustained following a stampede that retreated when canisters were fired. The clashes came after Venezuelas opposition and activists confronted troops stationed along the countrys borders to block their plan to bring in food and medicine that authorities are calling a veiled U.S.-backed invasion. Juan Guaido declared himself interim successor to President Maduro in the face of a crisis that has led millions to flee and left hundreds of thousands hungry.  While the need for basic food and medicines is real - with the countrys inflation running at more than  million percent per year - the effort is also meant to embarrass military officers who continue to support Maduros increasingly isolated government. Maduro said today that his government had broken relations with Colombia and he would expel some Colombian diplomatic staff after Colombia assisted the oppositions efforts to bring humanitarian aid into the country. He said in a speech: Patience is exhausted, I cant bare it anymore, we cant keep putting up with Colombian territory being used for attacks against Venezuela. For that reason, I have decided to break all political and diplomatic relations with Colombias fascist government.  He said the ambassador and consular staff would have to leave Venezuela within  hours. Guaido, recognized by most Western nations as the countrys legitimate head of state, defied court orders not to leave Venezuela by arriving on Friday in the Colombian border city of Cucuta, where aid from the U.S. and Colombian governments is stockpiled in warehouses. Today the obstacles that the dictatorship created will tomorrow be rivers of unity, of peace, Guaido said in a news conference in Cucuta, where he was received by Colombian President Ivan Duque. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said in a tweet late on Friday that Venezuelas government shut the Tachira border that connects it with Cucuta temporarily due to a series of illegal threats by Colombia. A group of frustrated Venezuelans who were seeking to cross into Colombia on Saturday to work morning threw rocks and bottles at National Guard troops, who responded with tear gas.  We were all going to work, we want to work, the people attempted to force through, said Viviana Meza, , who works in a Cucuta restaurant. At least four National Guard officers on Saturday at the border disavowed Maduros government and requested assistance from the Colombian government, Colombias migration agency said on Saturday. Maduro blames the countrys dire situation on U.S. sanctions that have blocked the country from obtaining financing and have hobbled the OPEC nations oil industry. Rodriguez says the aid is poisoned. I dont plan to leave my house over the weekend, especially after what happened near Brazil, said Paulina Sanchez, a -year-old grandmother who lives just  metersfrom the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge.  This could turn into a powder keg. In a slightly surreal twist Guiado and Maduro held opposing concerts just  yards apart on either end of a bridge linking Colombia and Venezuela. The battle of the bands pits Venezuela Live Aid organised by British billionaire Richard Branson, against Maduros Hands Off Venezuela festival. Branson,after being approached by Guaido, is bidding to raise million in donations through Venezuela Aid Live on the Colombian side ofTienditas bridge. On the other side of the crossing, closed off with freight containers, President Nicolas Maduro will hold hands off Venezuela - a three day festival. Guaido in January invoked articles of the constitution to assume interim presidency and denounced Maduro as a usurper, arguing his  re-election was illegitimate.

He still needs a lot of work, working with a partner and when to link and stuff but I’m delighted with his goals contribution so far.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss mcintyre ready to cross swords with new hibs gaffer heckingbottom","story":"Jim McIntyre and Paul Heckingbottom will cross swords for the first time in their managerial careers when Dundee and Hibs clash at Dens tonight.However, while Jim admits to knowing little of his opposite number, his knowledge of the team he’ll be putting out means he’s not expecting too many tactical surprises.Hibs appointed Heckingbottom as the successor to Neil Lennon last week and he kicked off his time in Scotland with an Easter Road win over Hamilton Accies.While, in time, the Dee boss knows his opposite number will put his own stamp on the Hibees, right now he’s not expecting too many drastic tactical changes from the way they lined up under Lennon.“I don’t know him but he got off to a good start and Hibs have good players. It’s going to be a tough game,” said Jim.“He’s got good options as well, you need to be able to handle that.“We know what players he’s got to work with and we know their strengths and weaknesses like we do most of the other squads in the league. It’s about making sure yours are better than theirs on the night, that’s how it is in football.“We are back at home in front of the cameras and want to put on a good performance.”Dundee go into the game boosted by last week’s vital win at Livingston that hauled them out of the bottom two in the top flight for the first time since late August.Again, though, the manager is stressing it’s where the team are at the end of the season that counts.“We could be back down there come Saturdaywe don’t keep it going.“Livingston is gone now and now it’s all about this one.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6fda4e46aa42.27335469.jpg ","title":"family pays tribute to dundee guitarist kenny whose music took him all over the world","story":"The family of a popular Dundee musician have led tributes to the talented guitarist following his death at the age of .Kenny Day died last weekend having spent the last years of his le living with dementia.A well-known figure on the Dundee music scene, Kenny, from Lochee, played in bands such as The Bad Pennies, Ringer and Sanjo during the s and s.His touring career took him across Scotland and the world where he performed in Germany and New York.Kenny’s son, Kenneth Day Jr, said: “It didn’t matter what it was – everything was a joke to my dad.“I remember his car broke down one night in Germany and he managed to fix the fan belt with women’s tights which were in the car.“A few months later he was still driving around with the tights connected to the fan belt.“He liked the women too.

People know my dad – after I put it on Facebook I’ve just had loads of comments with people saying that my dad was like a mentor to them.“Some musicians have been in touch to say my dad taught them how to play.”Kenny’s elder sister, Phyllis Duffin, , from Craigiebank, said his talents went beyond his musical knowledge, adding: “He had learnt six languages from French, Spanish, Urdu to Polish. He was very talented but had no common sense.“He loved going to Campbeltown in the west of Scotland to visit his cousins. I remember phoning through at one point and his cousin telling me he had been chasing their car in a Wombles suit!”Kenny, who was the youngest of four siblings, was diagnosed with dementia in his early s and entered a care home.Jackie said: “He would forget lyrics, it’s like he was fading away. It was a horrible thing to watch.“It was hard for him, he couldn’t drive anymore but he knew what was ahead. He developed a stammer and got frustrated.”Kenneth said: “Dad was a smart man so it was heartbreaking to see him getting ill.“The other week we were all sitting round him and he hadn’t spoken in over two years but then he began blethering and singing in German.“I told my sister that dad was talking and then he recognised Phyllis when she came in.“His music was playing in the hospital room and my sister turned down the stereo.“Dad said, ‘don’t do that again’ – it was braw!”"},{"url":null,"title":"shoppers complain of dundee post office mess as refurbishment is postponed","story":"A Broughty Ferry Post Office has had its refurbishment delayed despite complaints of it being littered with “mess”.The Gray Street branch was originally going to close from February  to March  to be given a makeover but residents have now been told the refurbishment has been postponed “indefinitely”.Christine Kenny, from Broughty Ferry, regularly uses the branch.She said: “The condition of the Post Office is a disgrace, with quite a bit of litter around.“There are bags of rubbish dumped in the front shop.”She added: “It was to be refurbished, but when I was in today the assistant mentioned it has been postponed.“The Post Office should have a say about its condition.“Even a brush, cloth or duster wouldn’t go amiss.”Ferry councillor Craig Duncan spoke of the store’s condition, saying: “The refurbishment has been deferred by the postmaster rather than the Post Office.

To add to the drama, it’s done as a race against the clock.And McIntyre is gaining a growing reputation for doing the same with top-flight clubs here.Four-and-a-bit years ago he arrived at Ross County with the Highland outfit seemingly already doomed to relegation.By the end of that season he hadn’t just kept the Staggies up, he’d rebuilt them into a squad that would go on and win silverware in the shape of the  League Cup.After the Dark Blues’ weekend win at Livingston got them out of the bottom two for the first time since the end of August, thanks to goals from new handy men Andrew Nelson and Scott Wright, there are strong signs he can do the same at Dens Park.McIntyre’s reign as Dundee boss started in October when he received an SOS from owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms.After a miserable start to the campaign, the Americans’ dream of cementing their team as a force in the Premiership and, eventually, taking the club to a new stadium looked in danger of crumbling around them.Confirmation of just how dire the need for an emergency rebuild came in his first game in charge when the roof fell in during a - defeat at Livi. It showed how flimsy the foundations of the team were as they collapsed under the weight of the home team’s excellence at set-pieces.Almost exactly four months on and after that second visit to the Tony Macaroni Arena under the new boss, the structure looks much more sound.And it’s all thanks to the kind of speedy reconstruction he undertook at County and of which Knowles and his team would be proud. For the team that ran out against Livi at the weekend bore no resemblance to the one McIntyre had to work with when he first headed there.Not one of the players in the starting XI in October were on from the start this time and of the  who were involved on that first day,  have left the club.Only Kenny Miller, Cammy Kerr and Elliott Parish remain and, of those three, veteran Miller was the sole participant in the vital - victory.For McIntyre, to bring about almost a complete change in such a short space of time has been a gamble, one that will only be confirmed as paying offhis team are still in the Premiership come the end of the season.It’s one, though, that represents his best chance of success and it is very much a case of so far so good.While Dundee under him remain a work in progress, the signs of improvement have been there for all to see.Since the end of the winter break there have been two wins, two draws and just one defeat in five league outings.By some margin that’s been the best run of form in the top flight so far this term.If it continues there is every reason to believe that target of building a team good enough for this level by the end of the season will have been achieved.Andthat is the case, fans will be hoping given more time, the manager will be able to set about putting together something even more impressive for next season and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potholes-20000-craters-rack-up-more-than-1m-in-repairs-in-2018","story":"MORE than pound, was paid out to Glasgow drivers for damage caused by potholes last year, new figures show."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-from-bedroom-dj-to-double-brit-winner","story":"CALVIN Harris has undergone quite the transformation, from being a budding DJ recording in his bedroom to becoming a double Brit-winning musician who models on the side."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-comes-together-to-give-west-end-youngster-confident-boost-over-her-new-glasses","story":"A YOUNG girl from Glasgow has won the hearts of the internet this week after the city came together to make her feel less ldquoashamed about her new glasses."},{"url":null,"title":"epilepsy-scotland-des-clarke-among-names-for-fundraiser-comedy-night","story":"EPILEPSY Scotland is warming up ahead of its third annual Patter Merchants Comedy Clash."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-and-snp-clash-over-equal-pay-at-council-budget","story":"A ROW over the decade long equal pay dispute broke out at the City Chambers as the SNP got its budget through"},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-the-referee-took-the-game-away-from-celtic-we-were-the-superior-team-until-the-red-card","story":"BRENDAN Rodgers last night blamed German referee Deniz Aytekin for killing off Celtics hopes of progressing to the last  of the Europa League by sending off Jeremy Toljan against Valencia."},{"url":null,"title":"steve-clarke-im-not-a-fenian-im-a-catholic-from-the-west-of-scotland","story":"STEVE Clarke today admitted that he couldnrsquot believe being brought up as Catholic was still an issue within Scottish football and society in general."},{"url":null,"title":"new-13m-plan-to-fix-more-glasgow-potholes-first-time","story":"MORE potholes will be fixed first time under a new repairs investment plan by Glasgow City Council."},{"url":null,"title":"james-mcfadden-scotlands-hopes-on-our-wide-men-as-we-start-euro-campaign","story":"HE was known as a wide man himself once.

Instead, local authorities, businesses and iniduals should tackle the problem by reducing the birdsrsquo food supply by cutting down the amount of edible litter and introducing gull-proof litter bins.Other non-lethal options include putting up physical barriers such as netting on roofs as a deterrent before the breeding season.ldquoWe believe that gull problems in an urban environment are best tackled by reducing the availability of food and nest sites. If the features that attract gulls remain, any `vacanciesrsquo created by controlling existing gulls will simply be filled by other gulls moving in, she said.Sunday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119686.jpg","title":"Roads not safe for city cyclists says Inverness campaigner","story":"A LOT needs to be done to bring roads in Inverness up to a standard that makes them safe and easy for road users to navigate, a leading cycling campaigner has said.Brian MacKenzie, convener of the Highland Cycle Campaign, said: ldquoI cycle a lot and there is no doubt the roads in the town are in very poor condition.ldquoThe trunk roads, too, need attention.Championing the cause for better and safer routes for cyclists he said drivers also need to be aware of cyclists and give greater consideration to them.ldquoDrivers often criticise cyclists when they see them weaving along certain routes but often they are doing that simply to avoid potholes and are taking evasive action, he said.ldquoAt the Raigmore Interchange, on the ramp joining the A south from the A, there is a pothole which has been there for some time.

“We are grateful to the Cabinet Secretary for her input into the newly formed Scottish City BIDs Group.“In many ways Scotland is ahead in the placemaking agenda, but it was felt this position could be re-enforced with the city BIDs coming together to collectively look to influence policy-makers at a local national level.“Along with this there is the aim of sharing good practice, of which there is plenty, looking at the economy of scale in procuring goods and services and generally furthering the Scottish urban BID agenda.”Meanwhile, Roddy Smith, CEO of Essential Edinburgh, added: “It is so

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

It is the time of Lent: the old Germanic word for spring-time. Our hearts are bidden to imitate the snow-drops: to come up from the darkness, raise themselves into the sunlight, and then fill the world with gladness.Parishioners from Ardrishaig, Christ Church, Lochgilphead and Glassary are joining together this Lent to read a poem a day through the  days of Lent and then Easter week. The poems have been chosen are in a beautul book, entitled The Heart’s Time, by Janet Morley. The poems come from across the English-speaking world, over the last four centuries. One poem is set for each day, accompanied by a short explanation, a reflection, and a brief suggestion for our own thinking.Parishoners will be reading the poems at home for those who wish it there will be meetings to share thoughts and inspiration at Ardrishaig Church during the weeks of Lent and at Christ Church on Sundays. Other meetings could be arranged, formally or informally.You can order the book from Fr Simon Mackenzie by emailing dr.lachlan@zen or calling  , or directly from Argyll Book Centre.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14036524.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_130219hospice2.jpg","title":"ayrshire hospice marks 30th birthday","story":"NewsAyrshire Hospice marks th birthday as staff and volunteers reflect on three decades of serviceThe milestone birthday has been marked with a series of events and celebrations.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor  years it has touched the lives of thousands in Ayrshire and far beyond.

Back in , the Auld Toun was saying farewell to J Thomson  Son – a business which had been founded in the s. The shop was taken over to make way for the giant Buttermarket development that saw British Home Stores move in. Ironically, BHS has now also gone, and that part of the town must again try to re-invent itself. Joan Kirk, , provides us with a link back to Thomsons’ wonderful shop.  For in  she was Mrs Thomson, and husband Gilbert was the third generation in his family to run the business. Mrs Kirk recalls: “Other old-established clothing businesses had closed by then, but Gilbert kept profit margins low to stay competitive. “However, BHS made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. “It was perhaps a blessing in disguise, as I got to spend time with Gilbert before he died in , aged .”  Mrs Kirk later remarried but has been widowed for a second time. The young Joan had come to Ayr in  from Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, to train as a nurse. She later met dashing young shop owner Gilbert, and the pair were married, going on to have a son and daughter. Hats were a signicant part of the Thomson business when Gilbert’s grandfather opened the shop in Victorian times. A large top hat is clearly visible above the front door in the old photo.

The group insist a “cultural hub” can spark much needed footfall at the town’s tired bottom end. And they hope a plan to rent the former clothing store, Millets, will aid their cause. FreshAyr, the team behind the project, are not new to opening ‘pop-up’ spaces in the town. But boss Robert Singer, , insists: “We believe this next phase is potentially our most important. “Ayr has lost its place as a market town and tourist destination. “Long gone are the factories, fisheries and agricultural markets of the past – even retail is failing. “So there is a serious pressing need to rethink the way people engage with High Streets. “Our project will focus on the arts and use it as a force for regeneration.” The team have won a three month ‘proof of cause’ deal which, they hope, will lead in turn to later funding.   Robert explained: “We have a five year project in mind with this unit ideally being our permanent base. “Until now, we have operated around the town on a pop-up basis but that is never ideal. “We’d like this as our home.” The ‘BREAD arts lab’ will launch next month and run in conjunction with the project’s bakehouse, which is set to operate from Cathcart Street. Robert said: “We want people to engage with the process...to come in and literally see bread being made before their eyes before taking it home. “At our High Street base we will stage exhibitions,

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

Norman Mackenzie, etc.The chairman, at the outset, welcomed all to what he was sure they hoped and felt pretty confident would be the last annual meeting during the war, for technically the war was still with us, although they all hoped and prayed that within a very few weeks a conclusion would have come to it and they would have entered upon the complete enjoyment of a conclusive peace."},{"url":null,"title":"london show for artists scottish seascapes","story":"A Southend artist whose studio faces the Atlantic ocean is putting the finishing touches to a series of seascapes for a London exhibition.Deadlines are nothing new for former internationally acclaimed graphic designer Mike Healey, an ex-Glasgow School of Artstudent and latterly the professor at the head of its design and applied art department.Speaking to the Campbeltown Courier last Thursday, Professor Healey said: #I have to complete  canvases by April  for a spring show at Thompson#s Marylebone Gallery.#Mike#s professional art career was boosted after his  graduation, with a first class GSA honours degree in graphic design, although in reality it began much earlier at Keil School, Dumbarton, which he attended, partly funded by a foundation award.At Keil he was influenced by teacher and painter John Cunningham, who also  went on to lecture at GSA, and Mike was further pushed towards GSA by his next teacher John Mathieson.Mike said: #I attended GSA from  to , the first four years were spent following a classical arts course in art, architecture, design and photography.#I loved photography, processing film and making prints in the darkroom.#I especially liked the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson and the war photographer Don McCullin and there us of the flexible mm format.#We were taught by an ex-BBC man who used to light everything with six lights and I came to like using available light without anything articial.#In the holidays, Healey worked as a medical artist at the Royal Infirmary.Mike added: #For some professors photography was not selective enough and when they were lecturing medicine they used illustrations.#I did a series on oxygen therapy and once drew a tracheostomy as it was performed on an Irish navvy.#Mike said everyone was told to #do graphic design# and, following a postgraduate year, he landed the prestigious Design Council#s Leverhulme Postgraduate Design Travel Award.This single award funded a year in the United States where Mike visited some of the New York advertising greats such as McCann Erickson, J Walter Thompson and Pushpin Studios.He ed in  to become a graphic designer at Glasgow textile firm J P Coats but the following year wanderlust took him back to Brazil, the country of his  birth, and a spell as a freelance in Rio de Janeiro.The start of the s found Mike at the largest advertising agency in Scotland, Rex Stewart and Associates but by  he had ed to academia as a GSA lecturer in the graphic design, illustration and photography department.A year later he was appointed head of the department and in  became head of the school of design and craft, all the time pursuing a design consultancy.Mike completed a wide iety of designs including work for the European Parliament, the Scottish Tourist Board, Robert Wiseman Dairies, Tunnocks, Ferranti, British Rail, TSB Bank and the Royal Mail.Dugald Cameron, who Mike replaced as GSA head of design, writing an introduction to a Mike Healey exhibition in New York, wrote: #It used to be called #commercial art# and used to be so described in the GSA prospectus until its relatively recent emergence as #graphic design#.#Is there a hint of pretension here, a disavowal perhaps of the decency of an art form at once truly democratic in its availability yet capable of scaling the heights of visual imagination in the useful service of commerce #Mike first came to Southend when he dated a Greenlees girl from Campbeltown and later bought Dunaverty house which was originally built for the village doctor by a Duke of Argyll.Mike#s studio is below the main house in what would have been the stables for the doctor#s horse.Round the house are signs of Mike#s fascination with all things designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh.The nameplate is completed in a Mackintosh script, the gates and fencing, although partially hidden by a hedge, are made up in the same square pattern.Mike retired early from GSA in  but did not stop producing art.He said: #Moving to Kintyre full-time was inspirational.#For more than  years he has been represented as a painter by London#s Thompson#s Gallery and among his patrons he can count the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.Mike Healey in his Southend studio. _chealey_studioMike Healey working #en pleine air#.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Now is the time for the Catholic Church   s own Reformation","story":"For this book Martel has conducted more than , interviews in the Vatican City in Rome, and across the world. He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"jamie-genevieve-opens-up-about-new-bbc-scotland-documentary","story":"Of course, the make up artist and YouTuber looks flawlessly gorgeous in every photo while lounging in the sun, flying business class and even looking impossibly groomed while eating pizza.The stats make for a showstopper too: , subscribers on YouTube, , followers on Twitter and . million Instagram followers.So what am I expecting from the -year-old  A bit frosty, maybe, a bit imposing.And I couldnt have been more wrong ndash a friendlier, bubblier woman you wouldnt hope to meet, full of good humour and good spirits.Jamie believes her own positivity is why she, unlike so many women with an online presence, has a pretty good experience of internet le.Those comments that arent positive, she just ignores.\"My fans are so sweet.

And, of course, in all of the UKrsquos wearied democratic institutions most notably here at Westminster.The Prime Minister has lost no fewer than  ministers because of it, including two Brexit Secretaries, as well as several others from government and party positions.Labour is not immune.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be.

Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those wrecks are still the primary focus of recreational ers, but the remains of the vessels that were mostly recovered and removed from Scapa Flow have also been a recognised ing resource for many years.However, the exact extent and composition of these so-called salvage sites was unknown until this week, when the report of the second phase of work on these sites was published online.The overall aim of the Scapa Flow Salvage Sites Project was to determine what remains of the many vessels of the German High Seas Fleet that were salvaged in the years that followed their scuttling in June .Phase One, undertaken over the winter of  , involved a side scan sonar survey of the main anchorages and other areas thought to have been involved in the salvage process.In the second phase of this project, ers and remotely operated vehicles examined and recorded the remains in detail.The overall result is that the vast majority of salvage sites in Scapa Flow have been located and the remains at each site have been directly investigated and recorded.The full report is now available for public download through the Scapa Flow Historic Wreck website http:www.scapaflowwrecks projects salvage-sites-phase- Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery.

But, so far, not in this instance. Some have greeted their departure with a sense of triumphalism that they are “not Labour” or “should join the Tories”. Others have spent the last few years hounding, harassing and bullying those very MPs in order to force them to leave the Labour Party. I think they are all missing the point.I’m angry at that approach but I am angrier at the reaction from the Labour leadership. What we needed last Monday was a moment for reflection.The MPs who have resigned their lelong association with the Labour Party have taken this heartbreaking decision not as an act of sabotage or spite but as a very last resort at a situation they felt was untenable. They also set out a challenge to the Labour Party leadership. Those challenges should have been thought about and dealt with. But instead we got a cloth-eared response that essentially dismissed their concerns.I’ve never been involved in the professional world of human resources, but I am sure in any other organisation there would have been a little bit of soul searching to ensure no others would leave, and to try and address the fundamentally important reasons for their leaving in the first place.And the challenges they set are fundamental.They rightly said that the current official Labour Party position to prevent a public vote with the option to remain in the EU, which is the Labour Party policy agreed at our conference, was not in the national interest, and is playing members and the rest of the country for “fools”.They rightly said that the Labour Party was lack-lustre at best and turning a blind eye at worst to the scourge of anti-Semitism that seems to be enveloping the party.They said that the bullying and intimidation of MPs was unbearable and this was being tolerated by the Labour leadership’s inability or unwillingness to do anything about it. And they rightly said that the current Labour Party was only that in name and the party they joined was no longer the one they recognised today.There is little doubt that our politics is broken, and the party system is breaking down.Many voters see themselves as being politically homeless and that is why the new Independent Group should not just be dismissed.If they capture the imagination of the public, demonstrate that our politics is broken, develop policies for all of the country, and guide themselves by the national interest, they will talk to a very large number of voters. At the very least, they may well recalibrate British politics.So, the Labour Party is at a crossroads. The leadership can either see the events of this week as a wake-up call and try to address the issues that have been raised or they can carry on with business as usual. I would plead with them to go with the former, but I fear they have already set the trajectory for the latter.If they take the wrong route now the public will look for something that better reflects their hopes and aspirations for a credible alternative government to this wretched Tory administration and it won’t be anyone’s fault but their own.I have no plans to join them, but Tom Watson MP was correct when he said, “I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it.”Those who have left have put the Labour Party on notice and I certainly don’t blame them for standing up for what they believe in. I just wish the Labour leadership would recognise the problem and listen, acknowledge, reflect, and reform.Ian Murray is Labour MP\u2028for Edinburgh South©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"peers summon jeremy corbyn over exodus of mps from labour party","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has been summoned to address Labour peers amid fears members of the group in the House of Lords could join a growing exodus from the party.At a meeting this week following the resignation of seven of the party’s MPs, Labour peers were united in anger at the response to allegations of anti-Semitism by the leadership.Only one peer at Wednesday’s meeting – writer and campaigner Baroness Bryan of Partick, who was appointed to the Lords by Corbyn in June – spoke up in defence of the Labour leader, a source told Scotland on Sunday.At the end of the stormy gathering, peers agreed to ask Corbyn to address them and explain what was being done to respond to the concerns raised by defecting MPs.Explaining her decision to quit, the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Bergersaid the Labour party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic”.Another parliamentarian who quit Labour on Friday, the Dudley North MP Ian Austin, said his Jewish father came to the UK as a child refugee in  while his family remained in Czechoslovakia and were murdered in the Holocaust.“I don’t think I could look at my dad in the eyeI stayed in the Labour Party,” he said.One Labour peer said colleagues fear senior Jewish members of the Labour group in the Lords could quit.The source said senior figures such as former English FA chairman Lord Triesman and the one-time Labour donor Lord Levy were considering their positions.“Only one person defended him [Corbyn]: Baroness Bryan,” the source said.Peers considered sending a deputation to the Labour leader, but a majority insisted he be called to address them. One Jewish peer told colleagues that it was “dficult to go amongst the Jewish community and be a member of the Labour party”.Responding to the wave of resignations, the peers were nearly unanimous in saying they “understand what they’re doing” and “neither condone nor condemn it”, the source said.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell admitted that the party needed to be “quicker and fiercer” in responding toincidents of anti-Semitism.In a bid to calm the anger over his handling of the anti-Semitism storm, Corbyn appointed the former minister Lord Falconer to lead a review of the party’s processes.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football.

Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now. Those responsible would be handed their Ps."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/whfp-mod-and-retrospective-150x150.jpg","title":"new skye gallery to bring celebrated artists studio back into","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe former studio of the late, much-loved and acclaimed artist Tommy MacKenzie was reopened as a new gallery space in Skye this week by a local businessman.Robert MacAskill, owner of the Relish Deli in Wentworth Street, Portree took on the studio following the passing of Mr MacKenzie in March last year and has decided to open it as the ‘Isle of Skye Gallery’, maintaining the space’s connection to the rich arts legacy set in place by the former Glasgow Print Studio member.Born in Shetland in , Tommy MacKenzie moved to Portree a year later and, after attending the local high school, he went on to study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"m22 closure after four vehicles in collision","story":"The M northbound is closed between the Ballygrooby Road and Moneynick Road junctions after a collision involving four vehicles on Friday night.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements.

He’s currently in Maghaberry. Alan Lundy, of Thornberry Close, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday charged with intent to steal and having a firearm. He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”. District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused Mr Lundy bail, citing potential witness interference and he was remanded in custody to appear by video-link on March .Alan’s partner’s house was raided late on Friday where he was arrested in front of his young children.Alan’s brother Daniel told the North Belfast News that he is innocent and his arrest and remand is the latest in a long list of intimidation against his sibling.“Alan is innocent, it is just internment,” he said.“There is sufficient evidence to prove where he was at the time of this so-called incident.“He is constantly stopped and searched and harassed. His family know where he was and everyone knows where he was.“Alan’s partner’s house was searched and has been on numerous occasions with the doors put through and his kids literally dragged from their bed at all hours of the morning. This is nothing but MI-directed.”North Belfast Saoradh representative Dee Fennell says Alan is “a victim of the state”.“Evidence has already been presented to the Magistrates Court when it was alleged he was involved in an incident in Ligoniel that he was  miles away in a fast food outlet and there is CCTV to prove that,” he said. “There is also proof via his phone that he was not there. There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry. This is the second time Alan has been a victim of malicious prosecution and internment.“In , Alan was a steward at a GARC protest and was accused by a PSNI officer of throwing a stone. He was sent to Maghaberry and served three months and it was only then that the PSNI officer retracted the evidence. His family is constantly harassed on a regular basis and, in my view, Alan is a victim of the state.“In the last ten years, Alan has been arrested between  and  times, had his house raided on more occasions than that, stopped and searched hundreds of time.“I am a youth worker. There are four definitions of abuse: physical, psychological, sexual and neglect. No-one can tell me that Alan Lundy’s children being dragged out of their beds in the middle of the night is not psychological abuse of children.“Alan Lundy personies what is happening to republicans across the six counties. It should also be pointed out that Alan has never been convicted of anything under what the British government callthe Terrorism Act.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-14.19.53.png","title":"that battered can is kicked again","story":"IN  the intense focus of many in the policing debates in our community was the lack of progress on legacy matters. It was deeply contentious that a new police service could be established without a wider societal process to deal with the harms of the conflict, especially violations by the RUC, including their involvement in collusion and their involvement in and cover-up of state killings.Many families took the view that policing was needed in the community and that the structures were there to make human rights-compliant day-to-day policing possible, but did not agree with the moves to engage in policing in the absence of a process to deal with the past.We all know that the path of a peace process is painful, the question is, what pain is expected from whom Victims affected by all actors have been asked to accept painful processes. Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":null,"title":"letters shed new light on ira actions in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

article.ece f AUTOCROP h --_new__I.JPGEmailNewly restored letters from the Irish War of Independence have unearthed descriptions of IRA actions in Londonderry during the tumultuous period..pushDated July ,  and February , , the correspondence details a gun battle and jailbreak respectively.The first relates to a party of IRA volunteers from the Derry City Battalion being sent to Long Tower Street to protect \"lives and property\" after civilians were shot dead by loyalists assisted by police and Army.\"On Monday morning shooting throughout the city became more general and at least six people killed attempting to get to work, many others were injured,\" the letter reads.As more IRA volunteer units were ordered in, the letter says \"strict orders were given to protect lives of citizens irrespective of religion\".The letter claims the Royal Irish Constabulary , stationed at the Diamond in the city centre, were \"firing into nationalist areas without any justication\".The IRA unit attacked and forced the police into the courthouse on Bishop Street, and two RIC officers were wounded.On the same day the unit took over St Columbs College at Bishop Street, making the building its HQ, as it gave a \"strategic position\", and stayed there for several days as the fighting continued.As the British military strengthened its position throughout the city, and an attack was planned for the college building, the IRA units pulled out.The letter names all IRA officers involved, many from the Bogside, Long Tower, Foyle Street, Bishop Street, Lecky Road, as well as further afield, with officers from America, Omagh, England and Dublin.The letter also says that \"Patrick Laffertys premises were used during this period for storing ammunition\".Other IRA records list \"Paddy Lafferty\" from Bishop Street in the city as a participant in the  rising but it cannot be veriedthis is the same person.The  letter refers to the successful rescue of a comrade from Derry Jail, and names all those involved, including Paddy Lafferty again.The Derry letters are part of the Brigade Activity Reports being launched today by Irish Defence Minister Paul Kehoe and represent the most anticipated file series within the Military Service Pension Collection.In order to administer pension claims under the Military Service Pensions Act, , committees were formed around the country of people who held rank in the IRA structure.These committees were requested to list operations and activities by the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Army during the most active years of the War of Independence .The Referee and Advisory Committee relied heavily on these files to assess personal pension claims.The Military ServicePensions Collectionproject releases the records of the Department of Defence dealing with the service of members of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, the Hibernian Rles, Cumann na mBan, Na Fianna Eireann and the Irish Republican Army from the period April  to September , .The release of the Brigade Activity files is the seventh release for the MSPC project, marking a new phase in the study of the Irish

I would like to see this work completed soon.Cllr Curran said the petition contained the names of concerned parents, community representatives and local residents and hoped the new path can be delivered sooner, rather than later.ldquoParents are keen to see the path provided to increase the safety of children who walk to and from the school. While new speed limits have been introduced in the village, speeding drivers remains a concern, he said.ldquoThe safety of the children who attend the primary school is of paramount importance as indeed is the safety of residents who walk along this particular route.The local politician, who thanked Angela Wills for helping compile the petition, hopes roads officials will act, highlighting the importance of having a safe connection between St Maryrsquos and Chapeltown.Cllr Curran said that while the villagersquos new speed limits were a welcome addition, the provision of the new path must be a priority to help ensure that a busy rural area is safer for all road users.Cllr Enright said community groups around the Dunsford area had joined forces to support the campaign for the new path to connect the school to the nearby church and community centre. He also confirmed that another petition calling for the footpath had secured around  signatures.He continued: ldquoSome progress to deliver the new path was achieved last month with a site visit by roads officials which I organised when school principal Ronan Fitzpatrick and parish priest Fr Gerald McCloskey had the opportunity to walk the route with them.ldquoHopefully this campaign is now on the cards for success.

It is important everyone continues to support traders during this scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17333834.the-buzz-of-the-farmers-mart/resources/images/9470990.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March . Wersquore really looking forward to it.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Catholics did not get the vote for another century, and women not for almost another two.In the s only a fraction of men had a vote, and even those who did often lived in boroughs which had so many electors that their vote barely counted, while others lived in ‘rotten boroughs’ where the tiny number of electors ensured disproportionate influence for each vote.But the shape of the current parliamentary system was already in place in the s. There were general elections every few years, and the House of Commons had primacy over the Lords, something it had not had a century earlier until Cromwell shook things up.One thing has not changed over those centuries, however — the first-past-the-postprinciple, in which the person who gets the most votes represents the constituency at Westminster.This applied in th century elections in which one candidate beat another  votes to , or a st century one, in which four candidates all get ,+ votes, one of whom shades the others to victory . FPTP suits a system in which two political parties are dominant. Generally the ultimate make-up of the House of Commons reflects the way the country has voted overall.In America, where the Democratic and Republican parties still dominate, FPTP works OK.But for decades in the UK it has led to unrepresentative outcomes.Labour and the Conservatives do fine, because there are many places where they poll very well and other areas where they poll very badly. They are almost always guaranteed  or so of the  Commons seats.But parties that poll consistently everywhere, but neither well nor badly anywhere, struggle.Ben Lowry: Road ads in Northern Ireland that seek to shock are less effective than the subtle ads in Great Britain that hint at carnage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"This has long been a problem for Liberals, who often got % or % of the vote but % or % of the seats.The problem has been worsening so that the electoral system is now throwing up massively unjust results. Ukip and the Greens got a combined % share in , five million votes, but only a seat each. In , the Lib Dems got . million votes, almost ten times the DUP’s , votes, but only slightly more seats,  to .You might think these points are obvious. Yet it cannot be that obvious because eight years ago, in , the UK thumpingly rejected reform in a referendum on bringing in a mild form of proportional representationin general elections.I am one of the few people on the political right who supported the Additional Votesystem. There is not enough room in this article to recap on the points we supporters of reform made in , but suffice to say AV, while imperfect, ironed out the worst of the injustices.It also kept the ‘single member’ seat, in which one MP represents one area, like West Belfast or North Antrim. In a true PR system you need multi member constituencies, so that, say, Co Down becomes a single vast seat with four MPs.The intimate link between representative and constituency is lost.Supporters of parties that do well out of FPTP, such as the DUP, tend to support the status quo. But it can work for a party for decades, then destroy it, as it did the Ulster Unionists. For + years they had + MPs until FPTP wiped them out and shut them out of Westminster.PR can lead to permanent coalitions, as mainland Europe shows, but FPTP can cause us to lurch between governments of firm left and right . If we go too far one way, the public corrects the other.Now, in these perilous electoral times which have seen phenomenons such as Trump and Macron sweep aside the established order, we risk disastrous outcomes.If you are a Corbyn fan or a Brexit purist, you might welcome the prospect of a general election in which the movement that you support sweeps the board.But it will ultimately be hugely damaging for parliamentary democracywe do not get election outcomes that broadly reflect the ying ways that people express themselves at the ballot box.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorBen Lowry: NI road ads that shock are less effective than subtle GB ads opening of Parliament: address by peers to George IIJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Ben Lowry: The first-past-the-post electoral system is producing massively unjust outcomes and needs urgent reformOur reproduced old News Letter report yesterday, from  yeas ago, referred to the king#s opening of Parliament in February of .

I am sure that most Christians, particularly Catholics, are sad when they read about sexual abuse perpetrated by people in holy orders an oxymoron combination,ever there was one. As News Letter readers are aware, the Latin Catholic Church, centred in Rome in Italy, is enormous in number and spread. It is in continuous existence since the death of Jesus Christ, some , years ago. I don’t believe the Catholic Church would have lasted so long without ine intervention. The religion started out with a relatively small number of believers, having their human foibles and weaknesses. For instance, Judas Iscariot and Peter and Paul. However, today, there are about . billion Catholics living on the planet and in excess of , men in holy orders to provide them with religious ministry. It must, a priori, be very dficult, humanly speaking, to manage such a vast and complex world-wide organisation clearly, from time to time,not all the time, serious spring cleaning from top to bottom is necessary. The summit is, one hopes, such a cauterisation.I will conclude by comparing the measured approach, referred to above, taken by the News Letter today and a Dublin newspaper. The Dublin newspaper has a sensational headline, “Priest forced woman to have abortions.” Coming from this Dublin newspaper, this is hypocritical the same newspaper, in my opinion, looks favourably on abortion provision.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We called a referendum and let people express their views ndash so we should not be seeking to deselect any of our MPs because of their views on Brexit.ldquoOur party is rightly a broad church ndash on that and other issues. And we will only save our country from the threat of Jeremy Corbynwe remain one.On Wednesday, the Commons is expected to consider an amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin enabling the House to extend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no deal by mid-March.A similar amendment was defeated by MPs last month, but there is speculation that enough Tory rebels, alarmed that there is still no deal in place, could be prepared to back it this time round for it to pass.Downing Street has saidthere is no deal by Tuesday, the Prime Minister will at that point make another statement to the House and table an amendable motion to be debated and voted on the following day.However, it is unclear whether that will be enough to stave off a revolt by MPs alarmed at the prospect of no deal ndash including potential ministerial resignations..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Theresa May insists Brexit must not be blocked article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.PSNI warn of children staggering about drunk or choking on their own vomit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
