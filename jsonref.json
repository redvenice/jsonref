[{"url":null,"title":"Lockdown UK Anna Wintour says queues block proof demand return luxury life","story":"Share this article\u0027I think what we\u0027re seeing is obviously the amount of celebrations that were postponed last year, the amount of weddings, engagements, big birthdays. So we\u0027re definitely seeing a bounce-back from all of that, and we believe given the products we sell, being the engagement rings, the diamond rings, the wedding rings - we see that continuing throughout this year.\u0027But we\u0027re also seeing a significant increase in Swiss watches, so people wanting to treat themselves. So I think there\u0027s a real balance between gifting for others and actually just wanting to treat themselves, they\u0027ve probably saved a lot of money.\u0027I think through lockdown we saw online that people weren\u0027t going away, they were getting refunds and they weren\u0027t spending and treating themselves. And now I think there\u0027s still limitations to what people can do and I think they\u0027re thinking they\u0027ve always wanted that Swiss watch or that diamond ring.\u0027Style experts have predicted that Britain is gearing up for a post-lockdown \u0027fiesta in make-up and in fragrances\u0027 not seen since the Roaring 1920s. L\u0027Oreal, the world\u0027s biggest make-up brand, predicts a post-pandemic sales bonanza when wearing lipstick will become \u0027a symbol of returning to life\u0027.That upbeat message was last night backed by fashion experts who claimed that lockdown-weary Brits are aching for the chance to dress up and socialise in safety again.In a reference to the hedonism of the 1920s following the First World War and 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, L\u0027Oreal\u0027s chief executive Jean-Paul Agon predicted a party atmosphere when Covid-19 is finally tamed.\u0027This will be like the Roaring Twenties, there will be a fiesta in make-up and in fragrances,\u0027 he said.\u0027Putting on lipstick again will be a symbol of returning to life.\u0027Leading make-up artist Ruby Hammer, who has styled A-list clients such as supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, agreed.\u0027We are already putting emphasis on our eyes and eyebrows by virtue of having to wear a mask but when we can reveal a little bit more of our face we will go bonkers,\u0027 she said.\u0027As human beings we love to celebrate - and make-up gives us a boost. In the 1920s, instead of people saying \u0027woe is me\u0027, they celebrated and looked fabulous doing it. So, there is no doubt that we will want to present to the world the same opulence and we do that by expressing ourselves through the way we look.\u0027It won\u0027t be seen as self-indulgence but something as very important. A beautiful fragrance or lipstick can make you feel wow.\u0027The \u0027Roaring Twenties\u0027, when people defied society\u0027s conventions by wearing daring fashions and holding wild parties, was most famously chronicled in F Scott Fitzgerald\u0027s novel The Great Gatsby. \u0027It was an age of miracles,\u0027 the novelist once wrote. \u0027It was an age of art, it was an age of excess.\u0027Cosmetic sales have plummeted during the coronavirus crisis as store closures, coupled with the shift to homeworking, prompted many women to ditch make-up with sales of foundation and lipstick plunging during the original lockdown by more than 70 per cent. But Lesley Blair, chair of the British Association of Beauty Therapy And Cosmetology, believes the cosmetics industry will prosper post-lockdown.\u0027There will be an absolute boom when this nightmare is over,\u0027 she said. \u0027We will be buying more than we\u0027ve ever bought before. We are desperate to get dressed up and with a little bit more disposable income that will be possible. Putting a little bit of lipstick on solves everything.\u0027Trend forecaster Andrew Ibi, of pressure group Fashion Academics Creating Equality, agrees that the sales bonanza will be driven by people\u0027s simple desire to feel good.\u0027Post-pandemic, we will be looking for ways to reconnect socially – clothes, hair and make-up will be part of the therapy,\u0027 he said.    "},{"url":null,"title":"Londons City University renames Cass Business School","story":"Share this articleBayes\u0027 alma mater gave his name to a £45million research centre connected to its informatics department in 2018.

They’ll be hoping it just goes away, but I’m hoping it doesn’t and I’m hoping this can really be used as a catalyst - there’s a famous Ivan Gazidis line from a few years ago when he called for a ‘catalyst for change’, well I think this is a catalyst for change, not just for Arsenal fans but for football fans. We absolutely dislike, hate is a strong word, but we really, really dislike our owners. It’s an absolute lack of respect for fans - he is not interested in any of this stuff we have spoken about and that is why he is the wrong owner.” Duncan Drasdo, the chief executive of the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust: “It is important to separate the football club and the owners because this decision was taken solely by the owners. So I think it’s going to have to come from the owners’ official statement. I think it’s appropriate, if there is going to be an apology, that it comes directly from them. I think if there isn’t an apology from the owners then obviously that’s going to be a kind of open sore that’s being pointed to for years to come. We don’t just want to see a change of ownership for the sake of it. But we don’t want the kind of owner that wants to use the club, purely to make money for themselves. And so that has to change. Arguably, their exit started as soon as they floated on the stock exchange and started to reduce their shareholding, it means there is an opportunity to do something that might actually change the path of their legacy. If they actually did something where they actually helped the supporters to take on ownership and there’s a mechanism to do that.”While I would agree with most of the above, the fact that they are still officially involved with the ESL is very surprising. It is nearly 20 hours since news first broke of the first English team withdrawing and yet here they are, hanging on. The longer they do that, the bigger the chasm will be between themselves and the rest of La Liga. They might need the Super League dosh to help with their debt, but this is a doomed project. It makes no sense to cling on when there is still the smallest ounce of face to be saved by not being the last club to withdraw. “It got a bit lost in all the hubbub last night,” writes Ben Blatch-Hanlon, “but I thought these words of the late, great Sir Bobby Robson were particularly poignant at this moment: The second email is from Robin Lindop Fisher.  “Wow, that Agnelli quote from the Nicky Bandini article about “the young people of today who are destined to become the spenders of tomorrow” really does say it all doesn’t it?! If this is how he perceives the concept of ‘destiny’ then it’s hardly a surprise that this was his vision for the future of football.”Here’s Nicky Bandini on Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, with a video to match.   I’m not sure about this period of reflection, mind. Football never stops for long enough for people to think things through properly. After meeting with the FSA, Boris Johnson was slightly less articulate, but echoed the sentiment. We’re down to the semi-finals!(What a goal by Marchisio at the end there, by the way)I imagine the rest all have their statements prepared. Who will be the last to cave? Surely Real Madrid? These withdrawals only make the ESL statement (from a few hours ago!) look even stranger. What happened to “reshaping the project”? There is no apology. And the brass neck of including the line that “sporting merits must prevail over any other criteria” after the last few days! Eeeeesh! “I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,” Agnelli said, stating it would have created the best competition in the world. “But admittedly ... I mean, I don’t think that that project is now still up and running,” he said. “Can you give over comparing the club statements like they some how matter? We need to stop apportioning blame and credit like any of them are different from each other. The game is rotten and I include the other 14 in that too, Everton and West Ham and all the others would have done the same. The reality is this week rammed the greed down our throats, most weeks we allow ourselves be fooled and park the obscene figures but this was just too much. Sky, Uefa, Man City and Chelsea are the saviours of football? Pass me the sick bag. “The soulless empty stadia and VAR have given so many people the opportunity to disengage from the sport in ways previously impossible, this is the final nail. Unless it all collapses and goes back to the days when fans actually matter ( I mean gate receipts cover player wages) then I’m done, I’ve wanted an out for years and thankfully the lads have provided it.”Asked whether the project could still happen after the exits, Agnelli told Reuters: “To be frank and honest no, evidently that is not the case.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fc32e5e242e602cd4ebf6496ddcabc8266e01e3/45_67_2213_1327/master/2213.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5b5b69f870b3a2b310080ebbdbcac869","title":"joe biden covid coronavirus vaccines republicans democrats politics live","story":"Courteney Ross, 45, who had given emotional testimony about her and Floyd’s struggle with opioid addiction, was candid: the courthouse was “not a comfortable place for many of us.” “So many of us have a lot of negative experiences with the government,” she said. “I have had many bad encounters here.” But that was the point of her being at the courthouse, Ross said: “I think it’s time we show what this building is supposed to be about, and it’s supposed to be about justice.” “It needs to come back with that guilty verdict,” Ross said, “so we can start to believe again.” Ross, who was wearing a cloth face mask printed with an image of Floyd’s face, waited outside the courthouse on Tuesday shoulder to shoulder with Toshira Garraway, a Black woman whose fiance, Justin Teigen, was found dead in a recycling truck in 2009 after fleeing from the St Paul police. The vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to meet on Friday to discuss the J\u0026ampJ vaccine. However, the White House has expressed confidence that the US will still be able to hit Biden’s vaccine distribution goals, even without J\u0026ampJ.  “We remain confident in our ability to meet the needs that we feel will be out there in the public by the end of May, and we will have enough vaccine for every American by the end of July without J\u0026ampJ,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said yesterday. “That is based on the supply that we’ve ordered from Moderna and Pfizer.”“In today’s remarks, the President will note that the United States will reach over 200 million shots this week,” a White House official said in a statement to the press pool. The president’s remarks will be delivered in roughly four hours from the South Court Auditorium at the White House.Joe Biden is scheduled to deliver remarks on the coronavirus pandemic later today, and the president is expected to announce a major accomplishment: 200 million vaccine doses administered since he took office in January. Biden had initially promised that 100 million doses would be delivered by his 100th day in office, which will occur next week, but he doubled that goal after the country hit 100 million doses weeks ahead of schedule. Despite the encouraging news on vaccines, Biden will also likely sound a note of caution about relaxing coronavirus-related restrictions too quickly. The country is still reporting more than 50,000 new cases a day, and 776 deaths were recorded just yesterday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. So the message from Biden will likely be this: we’ve accomplished a lot in the past few months, but don’t take a victory lap just yet.

Now an Olympian and Wales international, Joyce started playing rugby at local club St Davids, inspired by a teacher at her Pembrokeshire secondary school. “As soon as I picked up the ball I just loved it,” she says. “I was six or seven, and I haven’t stopped playing since. As a child I knew I wanted to play for Wales, but we didn’t have the role models that young girls have now – and if you wanted to watch women’s rugby then you had to go to the stadium and watch in person.” Joyce played many sports growing up, including county-level netball, but soon had to make the choice. “It wasn’t feasible playing so many sports, and my parents kept having to take me to all these different clubs. I enjoyed rugby the most so I decided to stick with it.” It’s a decision that Wales fans will thank her for, but one that hasn’t come without serious sacrifices. Just three months into her first year of university, when most students are partying at night and living on packet noodles, Joyce was called up to the Wales squad to play in the Dubai Sevens tournament. “It was a dream for me to play rugby, but I had to choose to focus on it,” she says.  Joyce’s dedication to the game is unquestionable. On top of the travelling involved for her club commitments (around one hour and 45 minutes each way from Joyce’s home to her Bristol training ground), the amateur status of Wales Women means that players need to work as well as playing for club and country. “At the moment, the hours we put into training is practically like being a full-time rugby player, but we then work 37-hour-a-week jobs, or go to university on top of that, and try to filter in any family time as well,” she says. It’s also becoming harder for countries such as Wales to challenge the professional set-ups of countries such as the now professional-level England and semi-professional France – as witnessed with Wales’ 53-0 loss to France in the first round of the tournament. “We believed we were going to go there and put up a fight,” she says. “France are full-time, so it’s inevitable that these things will happen there’s only so much we can train. Joyce says that there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes at the Welsh Rugby Union to secure contracts for players, so that they can excel and show what they’re capable of. “It’s really hard to compete against teams who are professionals when we are balancing full-time jobs. I’d love to see contracts come in this year.” The 25-year-old recently made the choice to stop saying no to things in her personal life and is currently in the final stages of completing her teacher training at University of Wales Trinity Saint David – although this is paused while she works with Team GB. “I’ve just decided to live my life and do what I want – I was putting my life on hold.” While the demands on a women’s rugby player are huge, the benefits far outweigh the sacrifices for Joyce. “It’s my way of giving back to my parents and everyone who helped me when I was younger. My parents love it – they follow me everywhere! When I was selected for the Olympics they were straight on that plane.” "},{"url":null,"title":"from grassroots games to the womens six nations how poppy and bryony cleall became rugby stars","story":"There are a number of twins who play professional rugby – England’s Tom and Ben Curry, or Jordan and Ryan Olowofela, or the South African Kriel twins – but the Clealls are the only female twins in the world who both play full-time professional rugby. Poppy has 45 caps for England, Bryony has three, and they both play in the Premier 15s at Saracens. Taking to the pitch together, they were quick to show their twin connection, with Poppy setting Bryony up with a quick pass that let the prop bundle over the line for her second try in an England shirt. “When you play for England everything is choreographed,” Poppy says, explaining how the twins’ try came to be. “I just got into my position. Normally I look left and right and say something to a teammate, but with Bryony I just give her the look and she knows what I mean.” Playing together for England is a dream that the 28-year-old twins have been building since childhood. They got close to achieving this in 2019, when they were both on the team sheet for the Women’s Six Nations fixture against Ireland. “Bryony got her first cap, but I came off before she went on, so we weren’t actually on the pitch together.” The pair started by watching their older brother play. “He was in an after-school rugby club, and my mum could only come to pick us all up at once, so Bryony and I had to stay until four o’clock and watch Josh play rugby. Then one time the coach asked if we wanted to join in – we of course said yes.” When the family moved to Bournemouth, Poppy and Bryony were keen to continue playing. “My parents emailed our local rugby club to say they had two children who wanted to play. The club said ‘great, bring them down’, but apparently changed their tune when they found out we were two girls. At first we were the only girls in the minis’ section, but the chairman had a daughter who also wanted to join, which helped.” The small club, Ellingham and Ringwood RFC in the New Forest, has become a surprising hub for women’s rugby, counting four ex-players in this year’s Women’s Six Nations. As well as the Cleall twins, there’s newly-capped Wales player Donna Rose and Scotland’s Lisa Cockburn. “I think that must be a record to get four international players from one club! For the boys, they all go to elite schools and rugby academies, but from the same grassroots club – that’s not bad is it?” The team was supported by the twins’ dad Peter, who was manager of the under-18s girls’ team. “My dad was very passionate. He and the chairman really wanted to push for equal opportunities for us, so they used to take us on tours all around the country.” Although the Cleall family couldn’t be there to watch Poppy and Bryony play together in Doncaster, family and friends could watch the game on BBC iPlayer. It’s the first time that all Women’s Six Nations games have been broadcast on one platform, which is something Poppy is pleased to see. “The coverage this year is triple of what I’ve seen before. When I’m going through social media, I’m seeing so much more coverage of players and their stories. “England’s final game will be on BBC Two, so the girls are looking forward to that,” says Poppy. “The production of the games is just great – so much better than in the past, it’s really positive.” The increased coverage of women’s rugby and the improved production values of the broadcasts offer a glimpse at the investment to come – which Poppy gets to experience first-hand as one of the few professional women’s rugby players in the world. In January 2019, England became the first side to award full-time professional contracts to its women’s players, which included former prison officer Poppy. The other benefit of being part of a professional set-up is the additional time together to train. “We’re getting to meet up and work on little bits together constantly – you can see the difference. You might say a girl has potential, but then you give her a contract and you see their skill level go up, their fitness goes up, and what they produce on the field is better.” The ability to play rugby full-time means Poppy is becoming one of the best rugby players in the world – a compliment she quickly brushes off. “My coach said to me at the start of this season: ‘Do you know the difference between an international player and a world class player?’ I said no, and he said that a world class player will take the people around them to a different level and make their teammates better. That’s what I want – I don’t want to be a standout player in England, I want the team to have 15 world-class players on the pitch.” "},{"url":null,"title":"the history of womens rugby and why it is finally having its moment","story":"“I never thought I’d be a professional player,” she says today, just six months after her retirement from the game. “When I got my first contract, my mum said: ‘I’ve got cheque stubs from when we had to pay for you to go play for England.’” Waterman, who is now a Guinness brand ambassador, and her peers have been part of an all-out revolution. There were fewer than 100 in the crowd when Waterman played her first game, and became England’s youngest player, against Ireland in 2003. It’s not long since the England team celebrated winning tournaments with a post-match meal eaten off paper plates at a park bench. But times have definitely changed: the profile and professionalism of the game has increased significantly, and the fact the 2021 Women’s Six Nations is being broadcast in its entirety means that many fans may be surprised to discover that a home nations tournament has only existed since 1996. Waterman was 12 at the time and, despite being from a rugby-steeped family, had no idea there was such a thing as an England women’s team. Three years later, at her first ever England camp, she was mixing with some of the most influential women in the game’s history. “I’ve never had that many female role models and all of a sudden I was getting to meet people like Gill Burns, who’s just the most iconic player for England. I was so in awe of these amazing athletes and their drive to be brilliant at the same time as doing full-time jobs. And that’s what stayed with me – their determination.”  It’s easy to forget that the women’s game has existed almost as long as the men’s. Emily Valentine who was born in Enniskillen, in what is now Northern Ireland, has long held the honour of being rugby’s first known female player – scoring a try in a team formed by her brothers in 1887 – but Lydia Furse, researching the sport’s history at De Montfort University in Leicester, has uncovered evidence that this was no isolated event. “In the same year in Hull there was a game with two teams of women playing rugby football against each other, but the game wasn’t very well received,” says Furse. “There was a pitch invasion and the players were carried off before it could be completed.” Victorian morals just wouldn’t allow for it and although a series of charity matches in south Wales during the first world war were positively received, when the men returned women were expected to retreat from the pitch to the kitchen and the laundry room, their role confined to washing the kit. When women’s rugby did finally establish itself in the post-war years, it was in an unexpected place: North America. Across the Channel, the game had been developing separately (and considerably quicker). By 1971, there was a French women’s championship comprising 22 teams, and France and the Netherlands were the first teams to stage an international women’s fixture, with the French side travelling to Utrecht to take on the Netherlands in 1982. France’s centre pairing were identical twins, Monique and Nicole Fraysse, and France won the game with a single, unconverted try. It was the 1991 Rugby World Cup that changed women’s rugby forever. Griffin, Dorrington and fellow players Alice Cooper and Mary Forsyth single-handedly organised a tournament that redefined the sport (while juggling full-time jobs, babies, and Dorrington’s role in the England team). No team could withstand the fierce athleticism of the US, with “locks from hell” Tara Flanagan and Tam Beckenbridge, helping consign England to defeat in the final. Three years later, several of those defeated England players enjoyed sweet revenge – including Emma Mitchell and captain Karen Almond at 9 and 10, who were pivotal in beating the US 38-23 to lift the trophy. But the follow-up tournament almost hadn’t happened – the International Rugby Board refused to sanction it, requiring a last-minute relocation of the action from the Netherlands to Scotland. For decades, women have driven their own game forward, pushed for it to be taken seriously and pioneered new roles. The formation of Saracens Women under Welsh international Liza Burgess sharpened competition and strengthened skills, as did the introduction of a home nations tournament, expanding from four to five and ultimately six teams. The US reached the Women’s World Cup final again in 1998, but it would be the last time they would do so – and their decline precipitated the rise of New Zealand, who won four successive World Cups between 1998 and 2010. The Black Ferns’ achievements were even more impressive given that logistics meant they rarely played Test-level opposition. Yet they consistently peaked in World Cups with a barrage of talent, from their brilliant hooker and captain Farah Palmer to long-serving fly-half Anna Richards and phenomenal try scoring wing Vanessa Cootes, who ran in 43 in only 16 Tests (nine of them in a single game against France). Meanwhile England have spent the past 10 years raising the bar of the women’s game, from the ferocious power of Maggie Alphonsi to Rochelle Clark, the most capped women’s player in history, and the kicking of Emily Scarratt, who led the Sevens team to a semi-final in its first ever Olympic appearance. And the Six Nations has become ever more competitive, with Ireland securing their first titles in 2013 and 2015, and Italy – who replaced Spain in the Six Nations in 2007 – a force to be reckoned with. Waterman believes that although the profile and professionalism of the sport has never been higher, there’s still plenty more to do. “It’s only the last few years we’ve seen an acceleration of the support, the facilities, the media opportunities, that’s bringing the sport in line with where it needs to be,” she says.

Regime-controlled areas have already begun vaccinating health workers, but not with doses from Covax. “Today, we received the first batch of Covid-19 vaccines,” said Abdul Hamid al-Hussein of the Physicians Across Continents group which accompanied the shipment into Syria. Mahmoud Daher, a senior official with the WHO, said the UN is ready to vaccinate Syria’s most vulnerable. “Once the vaccines arrive, we are prepared to start vaccination to priority groups through our implementing partners,” he told AFP before the vaccines crossed into Idlib. The first groups to be vaccinated will be medical workers and first aid responders, followed by people over 60. Younger people with chronic illnesses will get the vaccine next.Despite still having one of the world’s lowest caseloads, authorities in the capital Phnom Penh imposed a lockdown on 15 April following an outbreak beginning in late February, Reuters reports. Police arrested lockdown breachers and beat some with rattan canes following breaches of lockdown. In some “red zone” districts of the city, people are banned people from leaving their homes except for medical reasons. Cambodian human rights groups condemned the canings and arrests, saying that there were better ways to ensure people protected themselves and others from the coronavirus. “We are shocked such severe punishments are used against people for some small infractions,” Naly Pilorge, director of rights group Licadho, said. The Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) echoed the concerns, with its executive director Chak Sopheap saying: “We are dismayed at footage showing use of force by authorities against iniduals. Violence is never the answer.” A police spokesman defended the arrests and beatings, saying that “a small number of people” didn’t follow the rules and police “must take measures to save their lives”.Reuters reports that minister Rajesh Bhushan said that the government was also considering applications for oxygen imports from overseas suppliers. The world’s second most populous nation reported 295,041 new infections on Wednesday – the highest tally recorded globally yet.  It comes amid the deaths of at least 22 patients in a hospital in the western state of Maharashtra, caused by a leak in an oxygen tank. Meanwhile, hospitals in the capital Delhi said on Tuesday that they had enough oxygen left for just another eight to 24 hours, while some private clinics had enough for only four or five.Three returned travellers arrived on 3 April on the same flight, and stayed in adjacent rooms at the Mercure hotel on George Street in Sydney’s CBD. All three, two of whom are members of the same family, tested negative on day two of their stay, but then tested positive later on. Genomic testing shows they share the same viral sequence for the B1351 variant, first identified in South Africa. The European Medicines Agency said it had found a possible link between the vaccine and rare cases of unusual blood clotting disorders, recommending that a warning be added to the vaccine’s product information. It said the events should be listed as “very rare side-effects” of the vaccine. However, the EMA stressed that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. The regulator examined eight US serious cases of unusual blood clots, including one death, out of more than 7 million people have received the vaccine. The review came after Johnson \u0026amp Johnson halted the European rollout of its single-dose vaccine last week, a day after deliveries of the shot began, advising governments to store their doses until the regulator had issued guidance on their use.Reuters reports that industry and trade minister Denis Manturov made the comments about the one-dose vaccine, named Sputnik Light, following president Vladimir Putin’s state-of-the-nation address on Wednesday.  In his televised speech, Putin urged Russians to get vaccinated, saying he wanted Russia to reach herd immunity by the autumn. Russia has presented Sputnik Light as a temporary solution for countries with high infection rates that need to vaccinate populations quickly. Moscow has said that its two-dose Sputnik V vaccine will remain the main version used domestically.Following a change in guidance earlier this month, people between 18 and 29 will be offered Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine rather than the Oxford-developed jab amid a possible link between the shot and extremely rare blood clots.  Researchers from the University of Stirling examined whether concern about the AstraZeneca jab led to “vaccine hesitancy”, after several European countries suspended their use of the vaccine in mid-March and following the change in UK guidance on 9 April. Prof Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), who worked on the paper described the results as “very good news”.  Appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Semple said that there was a sharp drop off in the number of vaccinated people experiencing Covid symptoms 21 days after a single dose of a vaccine. In the study, most vaccinated people who displayed symptoms of Covid and went to hospital had become infected before their immune system had a chance to respond to the jab. The research examined more than 74,000 hospital admissions between September and early March, of which just under 2,000 people had received the vaccine. Experts then compared the time period between having the vaccine and the onset of symptoms. “Now if the vaccine didn’t work, that number of days would stay relatively constant over time, but instead, what you see is most people who were admitted had caught their infection within a week of vaccination - either side of the vaccination - but then there was a really sharp drop off in numbers,” he said. The Kremlin has said vaccination levels are disappointing, with more than 8 million of its 144 million-strong population having received a shot. It is not clear how many of this number have received a full vaccination course. Addressing parliament at his televised, annual state-of-the-nation speech on Wednesday, Putin called on Russians to get the jab. “Everyone must have the opportunity to be vaccinated, as this will allow for so-called collective immunity to be developed in the autumn,” he said. “A solution to this problem lies in our and your hands, in the hands of all citizens. I once again address all Russian citizens with the call: get vaccinated.” As well as its main vaccine Sputnik V, Russia has also authorised two other shots, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac, for use in the country. Ministers are meeting on Wednesday to approve a decree that will include the requirement for a so-called “green pass” document that will allow people who are vaccinated against Covid-19 or who have overcome the virus to travel freely within Italy and go abroad. Others will also be able to travel so long as they have a document the proves they tested negative for the virus within 48 hours of their departure date. Italy is expected to begin easing lockdown restrictions from 26 April, with the return of “yellow” or “white” zones. The country’s 20 regions have either been in the tougher orange or red zone categories since mid-March. Under the new measures, cinemas and theatres will open in regions categorised in the more lenient zones, while bars and restaurants can serve clients at outside tables. Open-air swimming pools will be able to open from 15 May and some gyms from 1 June. Italy registered 12,074 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday and 390 fatalities, bringing the total death toll to 117,633. Admissions to hospital and intensive care have been gradually decreasing.

Since then, over 240,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,800 people have died.Globally, over 140 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 88\u0026nbspdifferent vaccines in clinical development, with another 184 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top four cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople aged 65 to 69 who are at high risk (cohort 5), other people aged 65-69 (cohort 6) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

This includes the reopening of facilities for outdoor sports, including golf and tennis, and outdoor visitor attractions including zoos and heritage sites.The maximum attendance at funerals will increase to 25 but the ban on other gatherings remains.Senior Government sources indicated on Tuesday night that they expect further easing to proceed briskly over the next two months, with the potential for some sectors to be accelerated if case numbers continue to decline.One source involved in the process said the belief on the political side was that there was declining public tolerance for the continuing lockdown as case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths continue to fall. The Government needs to recognise and take account of this as it makes plans for the coming months, several senior sources said.It is understood, however, that there is resistance to some aspects of reopening from public health officials who prefer a more cautious timetable, and aspects of the plans remain under discussion. There is expected to be intense behind-the-scenes wrangling before decisions on the May reopening are finalised and announced in the middle of next week.Intense discussionsThere are also intense discussions going on in Government over the vaccination programme. Disruption and delay to vaccine deliveries mean the State will struggle to hit its slimmed-down ambition of 860,000 doses in April, and presents a headwind for the target of giving a single dose to 80 per cent of adults by the end of June.“We’re working towards that as best we can,” HSE vaccination lead Damien McCallion told the Oireachtas Committee on Health on Tuesday, but he added: “There are very significant supply challenges.”AstraZeneca again cut its delivery volumes for a shipment scheduled on April 24th from 45,000 to just 9,000, while a delivery of 165,000 doses due on Friday April 30th has been delayed until May 3rd.The short-term impact will be mitigated by a stockpile of AstraZeneca doses and increased Pfizer deliveries, but it will be another drag on the goal of hitting 250,000 doses administered in a week. Mr McCallion said the HSE will hit that figure, “but at the moment, we do not have the supply to test the system to get there.”He said the HSE expects to receive 800,000 doses in April, 1.4 million in May and 1.6 million in June. Between 140,000 and 160,000 doses will be given this week.But uneven progress is causing unrest among coalition backbenchers. Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin South West John Lahart said the HSE and Government should “stop promising 250,000 a week and just be straight with people about the vaccine rollout, you’ll get more respect for it”.On Tuesday, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson said it was to resume deliveries of its one-shot Covid-19 vaccine to the European Union after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) confirmed its benefits outweighed the risks of blood clots as a very rare side effect.More dataChair of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) Prof Karina Butler indicated the body would consider the EMA finding and await more data due in the coming days from the EU and UK regulators before making a recommendation for the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine, and on the question of lengthening dose intervals of the Pfizer shots.There is impatience in Government about a recommendation on the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine, which sources say could be administered as early as next week if cleared by Niac, helping to make up for the AstraZeneca shortfalls.Significantly, Prof Butler said the data would be studied alongside supply forecasts and the wider impact of Niac advice on the programme before a recommendation was given to the Department of Health.Meanwhile, the Department of Health confirmed on Tuesday that the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan had returned to work.Dr Holohan’s wife, Dr Emer Feely, died after long illness in February, and he had been on leave until this week.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"foster denies unionists boycotting meetings with republic s ministers","story":"Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster described as ‘misplaced’ and “’quite mischievous’ claims of an unspoken campaign to scupper NorthSouth Ministerial Council meetings by not putting forward unionist Ministers. File photograph: Mark MarlowPA Wire Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster has denied unionists are boycotting meetings with the Irish Government as part of a plan to overthrow the Northern Ireland protocol.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader described as “misplaced” and “quite mischievous” claims of an unspoken campaign to scupper NorthSouth Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings by not putting forward unionist Ministers.On Friday, a meeting involving Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan and his counterpart in the North Nichola Mallon had to be abandoned because, as Ms Foster said, “it did not suit” the nominated unionist Minister to attend.It was the second such meeting in two weeks “to be obstructed in this way”, according to Justice Minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long. But speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday, Ms Foster rejected allegations “that we are refusing, in inverted commas, to attend meetings between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of the Republic of Ireland”.“That is simply not the case,” she said.But she warned NorthSouth relations “will of course be affected by the fact that the protocol is in place, because of its damage to eastwest relationships.”“We need to sort it out and we need to get rid of the protocol so we can continue to have relationships with our nearest neighbour in the appropriate way in the future,” she added.Unionists have united for a five-point plan to get rid of the protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement which puts a de facto trade barrier for goods in the Irish Sea to prevent any need for a hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland.Ms Mallon has accused the DUP of engaging in a “deliberate act” of obstructing North-South co-operation as part of its plan, adding that it was undermining the Belfast Agreement.Responding to remarks by the European Commission vice-president in charge of Brexit, Maros Sefcovic, that the protocol was the only way to protect the peace deal, Ms Foster said Mr Sefcovic “either wilfully misunderstands the Belfast Agreement or is misrepresenting it for his own ends”.“There is a need for those in Europe, in London, in Dublin as well, to listen to the voices of those of us who will not have the protocol, because it is damaging the economy of Northern Ireland,” she said.“But more than that, it is damaging our citizenship here in Northern Ireland as equal citizens of the United Kingdom, because we cannot partake in the internal market of the United Kingdom.”Asked if the North’s DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds would attend a scheduled NSMC meeting due to take place this week, Ms Foster would only say her party was “fully aware” of its legal ministerial responsibilities.Ms Mallon had gone ahead with last Friday’s meeting “despite the fact she had been told it did not suit the nominated person who would accompany with her” under the cross-community rules of the meetings, she said.Ms Foster said the agenda and papers for the meeting had also not been agreed by her office.NSMC councils have to “proceed by agreement” and “I very much hope agreement and consensus will be sought by those Ministers setting up NorthSouth Ministerial Council meetings in future”, she added.The DUP leader met businesses in the North on Friday to discuss the costs they are suffering as a result of Brexit.“I was, I have to say, alarmed at the extra costs that those businesses are having to incur,” she told the Assembly.“Some of course are passing them on to consumers and to clients, which is very worrying as well.”Ms Foster said there has been a “reduction in choice and an increase in costs”, which she blamed on the protocol “being implemented in the fashion that it has been”.“I mean, the amount of damage being done to our businesses is quite incalculable,” the First Minister added.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald warned any refusal by unionists to participate in NSMC meetings “raises very serious questions, not just for the DUP, but for all of us”.“You can’t cherry pick the Good Friday Agreement,” she said, after meetings with other Stormont Executive parties in Belfast.“Political progress, stability and inclusion relies on all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement working and working well.“The North-South piece is absolutely essential and that means that unionists of all hues have to participate in those meetings. I think it would obviously be hugely problematic if there was any suggestion that any strand of unionism was stepping back from that or causing a problem with the North-South mechanism.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"good news on the horizon on travel and summer holidays says coveney","story":"A file image of a nearly deserted Dublin Airport. Simon Coveney said on Wednesday that ‘at some stage over the next number of months I think you will see the benefit of the potential for international travel again’ There is “good news on the horizon” about allowing non-essential travel such as holidays abroad but any changes to travel advice will be gradual, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.He said the message was still that there should be no non-essential international travel but that may change over the summer months.Mr Coveney said the Government is working towards being part of the European Commission’s green passport scheme which will make it easier for vaccinated people to travel throughout the EU. That system will likely be in place in the EU from June and the Government will have to decide when to join that in conjunction with public health officials and based on risk levels, he said.Mr Coveney said at some stage over the coming months people will see the potential for international travel again. “I think that is still some way off but certainly that is where this is going in terms of facilitating international at some point in the future.”He said people should not be booking holidays abroad at this point and said any change to travel advice in the coming months would be gradual.Mr Coveney also said the Government will be cautious in easing restrictions when the Cabinet meets to decide on the future roadmap next week. “We will be cautious because the one thing I think the public won’t accept is if we start going backwards again on the numbers because we have come out of restrictions too quickly in an effort to give people too much good news too quickly.”“You will get in the next ten days a pathway of what to expect over the summer months.We are asking people to be vigilant and stay with us even though many people are frustrated and exhausted. The months of June, July, August and September will be months of progress, of loosening restrictions.“We need to gradually emerge from those restrictions with caution. We still need to be aware are living in a global pandemic, it hasn’t gone away.”He was speaking at the launch of the Government’s Be Summer Ready public safety campaign which is focusing on water safety.“We have had a really tough year because of Covid-19 and as the weather gets better and the days get longer it is so important that we ensure that we are vigilant with regard to our personal safety when working or visiting the coast, lakes, rivers or our countryside.”“Almost half of the population of Ireland lives within 5km of the sea and practically everyone lives within 20km of either the sea, a lake or a river. We also expect that this summer will see increased visitors to these areas as people holiday at home. So we are asking everyone to be alert to water safety.”Minister of State at the Department of Transport Hildegarde Naughton said as the country emerges from “what has been a most challenging winter of restrictions, we are all looking forward to this summer with increased hope and anticipation. I think it is fair to say that our level of expectation and hope far exceeds anything we experienced for some time.”She said given the restrictions on international travel there will likely be increased levels of activity on the coastline and on water this summer. She called on holidaymakers to “make a plan” before they go near the water, let someone know where they are going and when they plan to be back.Minister Heather Humphreys outlined how there are approximately ten drownings in Ireland every month as she called on the public to report any damaged or missing ring buoys to their local authority.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sam the trinity fox gives birth to five cubs on campus grounds","story":"Sam, the fox living on the grounds of Trinity College Dublin, is now the proud mother of five fox cubs.

File photograph: Sergey DolzhenkoEPAJust 9,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine will be delivered to Ireland between now and May 3rd, after the latest round of cancellations and delays by the drugmaker.The Health Service Executive confirmed that a delivery scheduled for April 24th has been reduced from 45,000 doses to just 9,000. A delivery scheduled for Friday, April 30th, of 165,000 doses has been delayed, with a new arrival date of May 3rd.Well placed sources said the immediate impact on the vaccine rollout plan would be cushioned as there are significant levels of AstraZeneca in stock at the moment, as administration was paused last week. Also, some deliveries intended for the under 60s would not be taking place as the current advice was against giving that vaccine to that age group.There is also anticipated to be higher volumes of Pfizer delivered in the coming days, which will offset some of the impact.However, the drop in AstraZeneca deliveries will inevitably have an impact in the weeks ahead, sources said, likely proving a further drag to the overall weekly rate of administration, which has struggled to hit the targeted level of 250,000 doses administered per week. AstraZeneca is the main vaccine being used to inoculate the 60-69 age group. The shortfall first emerged at a sitting of the Oireachtas health committee on Tuesday.The HSE’s vaccination programme lead said there would be about 140,000-160,000 doses delivered this week, but that the impact of the AstraZeneca shortfall on next week’s target was still being calculated.Asked about the chances of hitting the Government’s target of administering first doses to 80 per cent of the population by the end of June, HSE vaccination lead Damien McCallion said: “We’re working towards that as best we can, but it’s very much led by supply”.“In terms of the overall target, we are continuing to work to that, but there are very significant supply challenges”.But the AstraZeneca shortfall “will limit some of the vaccinations we can do”. Mr McCallion said the hope was for 800,000 doses to be delivered in April, 1.4 million in May and 1.6 million in June. Some 200,000 are scheduled to be delivered this week, and between 200,000 and 250,000 next week.Asked if the HSE could deliver 250,000 doses in a week he said: “We will get to those figures, we will need to get to those figures.. but at the moment, we do not have the supply to test the system to get there”.Meanwhile, Prof Karina Butler of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee signalled that new advice for pregnant women could see them vaccinated more quickly. “Women who are pregnant are not at more increased risk of getting infection but they are at increased risk of adverse outcome,” Prof Butler said.She said, many mRNA vaccines had been given to women in pregnancy, with data from the USA “very reassuring”. “We’ve been looking at this very actively at the moment and will be preparing some advices for submission to the Department”.“If the issue comes that it is recommended in pregnancy, it’s not so much that they require a specific priortization as such, but if pregnancy is time-limited, it may be that giving it to them might need to be facilitated in some way.” “That will be coming out very soon, we’re just finalising what will be coming from that.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"seanad byelection results maria byrne elected to agricultural panel on first count","story":"Maria Byrne has more than 20 years of political experience, having served as a Limerick councillor and mayor before being elected to Seanad Éireann in 2016. Photograph: Tom HonanFine Gael’s candidate Maria Byrne has been elected to the Agricultual Panel on the first count in the first of two Seanad Éireann byelections.Returning officer Martin Groves formally began counting at 11.30am, half an hour after voting closed. The electorate for byelections to the Upper House comprises only sitting Senators and TDs, 228 in all. A total of 202 TDs and Senators cast a vote.Ms Byrne has more than 20 years of political experience, having served as a Limerick councillor and mayor before being elected to Seanad Éireann in 2016. She too missed out in 2020.Two other candidates were vying for the vacancy on the Agricultural Panel caused by Fine Gael’s Michael D’Arcy. Former senator Ian Marshall, a unionist, was being supported by Sinn Féin, smaller parties and Independents, while the Labour candidate was Kildare councillor Angela Feeney, who is head of culinary arts at Technological University Dublin.The second panel to be decided is the Industrial and Commercial Panel. Fianna Fáil’s Gerry Horkan, also a former senator, is the front-runner of the four candidates, as he will have received support from Fine Gael and some members of the Green Party parliamentary party. The others are Independent Billy Lawless, Labour’s Ciarán Ahern and Green Party chairperson Hazel Chu who is running as an Independent.While Ms Chu is not expected to win, there will be much attention on how many votes she wins and whether or not it will have an impact on Mr Horkan.Joint strategyFianna Fáil and Fine Gael agreed a joint candidate strategy with each party standing just one candidate in the hope of electing both. The two main parties in Government have 108 TDs and Senators and, if the agreement held, Ms Byrne and Mr Horkan would be re-elected.A former Dublin councillor, Mr Horkan was the Fianna Fáil spokesman on finance in the Seanad between 2016 and 2020. He narrowly lost out on retaining his seat on the Industrial and Commercial Panel during the 2020 Seanad election.Ms Chu’s decision to run as an independent ided the Green Party, with party leader Eamon Ryan wanting his TDs and senators to vote for Coalition candidates in the expectation they would support a Green candidate should another vacancy arise during the lifetime of this Government. Deputy leader Catherine Martin, on the other hand, signed Ms Chu’s nomination papers.The process involves a secret ballot, so it remains possible that some Coalition TDs and senators may not have voted for the agreed Government candidates.The two vacancies came about following the resignation of Fine Gael’s Michael D’Arcy to take up a position as chief executive of the Irish Association of Investment Management.

That has implications for how we travel, what we eat, and how we heat our homes.The legally binding pledge puts the UK at the forefront of emissions targets among leading economies, and comes ahead of a climate summit hosted by US President Joe Biden on Thursday. It means a 58 per cent cut over the next 15 years, according to analysis by the website Carbon Brief, and will require changes to the way we heat our homes and travel, and what we eat.For the first time, the UK will also include emissions from international aviation, which could cause a rise in air fares. Here\u0027s how the target might be met.The latest targets include international aviation for the first time, which counts for 7 per cent of the UK\u0027s total emissions. The Government\u0027s advisory body, the Climate Change Committee, has suggested raising the costs of flying with a frequent flyer tax, or higher Air Passenger Duty.The CCC is also hoping for a reduction in demand in the wake of Covid-19, particularly in business travel. Andrea Leadsom, the former business secretary, said on Tuesday that the pandemic might have changed attitudes to travel among many of our men who have a nice wife at home and who have discovered what it is to juggle the kids and Zoom and getting dinner on the table.The Government has set a target for all homes to be EPC C by 2035, requiring retrofitting for two thirds of properties.The CCC also wants all homes on the market to achieve EPC C by 2028, potentially making it difficult to secure a mortgage for those properties that do not meet the target. Retrofitting costs could average £18,000, according to the Environmental Audit Committee, with older homes more difficult to tackle.Replacement gas boilers are likely to be banned from the mid-2030s.Heat pumps are the most likely alternative in most homes, but they do not suit blocks of flats and require space for a water tank. Other options might be district heating systems or, in some areas, hydrogen, though the technology at scale is untested and could prove expensive.Shipping will also be included in the UK\u0027s emissions targets for the first time, and currently accounts for around 3 per cent of the total.Globally, if shipping were a country, it would be the sixth largest in the world in terms of emissions.There is no straightforward plan to decarbonise shipping, but solutions focus on switching the fuel to a low-carbon alternative, possibly hydrogen.In announcing new targets, the Government emphasised that it would maintain people\u0027s freedom of choice, including on their diet.That appears to put them at odds with their advisers, who have said there will need to be a 35 per cent reduction in meat and dairy consumption by 2050, to reduce methane emissions. That will also free up some land to meet the CCC\u0027s target of planting 50,000 hectares of trees a year between 2035 and 2050.But officials might be relying on natural shifts in diet, including rapidly growing demand for plant-based versions, and the potential for lab- grown meats in coming years.The electric car revolution is well under way, with the Government banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. The CCC wants 43 per cent of all cars on the road to be electric by 2030.Among the challenges to getting everyone to go electric will be ensuring there are sufficient and accessible charging points, and making sure the National Grid is equipped to deal with a higher level of demand.Those without off-street parking also face significantly higher costs for charging at public charging points.The upfront costs of electric cars remain prohibitive for many, although overall running costs often work out lower and the CCC expects them to reach cost parity by 2030.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"george floyd 9 minutes 29 seconds sparked civil rights movement","story":"In his opening statement, the prosecutor in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the white police officer accused of killing black man George Floyd, told jurors: “Nine-two-nine: these are the most important numbers in the case.”The 9.29 that attorney Jerry Blackwell refers to is the number of minutes and seconds Mr Chauvin had his knee pressed on Mr Floyd\u0027s neck.For the duration the Minneapolis police officer bore down with most of his weight while Mr Floyd lay face down with his hands cuffed behind his back.The moment of the 46-year-old\u0027s death - and the moments leading up to it - have been pieced together using video taken by bystanders, from CCTV and from the officers\u0027 own body cams.The footage of Mr Floyd crying out I can\u0027t breathe before he died touched off protests across the US and the world. The court in Minnesota was shown CCTV footage from inside Cup Foods, the Minneapolis shop Mr Floyd had visited on May 25 at around 7.30pm to buy a pack of cigarettes.In the surveillance footage, Mr Floyd can be seen laughing with employees and shoppers as he moves around the store, at one point holding a banana and at another point pulling out what appears to be some cash. Christopher Martin, a 19-year-old store clerk, testified that he had spoken briefly about sports with Mr Floyd and that he had appeared to be on a drug of some kind. An autopsy determined that Mr Floyd had taken fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamines.He asked a manager what to do and a manager told him to go to Mr Floyd, who was sitting outside in a car, and ask him to come inside, which Mr Martin said he tried to do twice. When he refused, Mr Martin said he offered to pay for the purchase himself but that the manager had him call the police.In a transcript of the 911 call that was made, Mr Martin said Mr Floyd had paid for cigarettes with “fake bills” and was sitting in his car outside the store “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself”.Two officers, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, arrive minutes after the call is made. They order Mr Floyd out of the car. Officer Lane then pulls out his gun from its holster and orders Mr Floyd to put his hands on the wheel.After about 90 seconds of back-and-forth, Mr Lane then puts his gun back in the holster before yanking Mr Floyd out of the SUV. The encounter is being filmed by a bystander in a car parked behind Mr Floyd’s.Just over two minutes after this, the officers issue a “Code Two”, a non-emergency call for medical assistance due to an injury to Mr Floyd’s mouth, which is bleeding. It is quickly upgraded to a Code Three.According to the criminal complaint, Mr Lane asks if they should roll Mr Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no.At 8.27pm, 20 minutes into his arrest, an ambulance arrives. The paramedics check his pulse, while Chauvin keeps his knee in place for another minute, removing it only when asked by the paramedics.They load Mr Floyd into the ambulance, which leaves the scene.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italian skiver draws salary 15 years job never performed","story":"In a crowded pantheon of bone-idle Italian public servants, he took the biscuit – not to mention the pay packet, the pension and all the perks.  Public health worker Salvatore Scumace allegedly managed to draw a salary and social security payments for 15 years without putting in a single day’s work, costing the Italian state no less than €538,000 (£464,410). He was supposed to be working as a fire safety officer in the Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital in the town of Catanzaro, in the southern region of Calabria.Instead, the man hailed by one Italian newspaper on Wednesday as “the king of absenteeism”, skived off every day.He was spotted in the hospital just once – the day he went in to sign his work contract, back in 2005.Italy has for years had a chronic problem with “ghost” public officials who either never turn up for work or clock on and then promptly disappear for the day, sometimes holding down jobs in the private sector.Mr Scumace allegedly maintained the ruse by threatening the directors of the hospital, saying they and their relatives would be hurt if they revealed the fraud.He was only found out when Italian police found an anomaly when they compared a list of the hospital’s staff with the shifts that they worked.After an internal investigation, he was sacked last September from the job he had never performed.The 66-year-old has now been charged with aggravated extortion, fraud and abuse of office. Six of his bosses face charges of abuse of office for not having investigated the alleged fraud.Mr Scumace was not the only skiver on the hospital’s books. Another 57 employees of the hospital were recently denounced for absenteeism and are under investigation.On the days when they bunked off work, they were allegedly seen playing slot machines, drinking in bars or shopping at the supermarket.In 2015, a town on the Italian Riviera was swept up in a scandal over absenteeism after it emerged that council employees were clocking on for work and then heading to the beach, to the shops or even back to bed.A months-long covert investigation by police found that up to 75 per cent of council employees in San Remo, which is famed for its annual music festival and lies just across the border from Monaco and Nice, failed to show up for work.In one particularly brazen case, a security guard regularly turned up in his underpants, punched his time card and then promptly went back to bed.The guard lived on the premises of Palazzo Bellevue, the council’s main office, enabling him to clock in and then return to his flat.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacinda ardern now wests woke weak link","story":"Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s tiresomely woke prime minister, often complains that one of the biggest challenges her country faces in promoting its interests overseas is that, owing to its remote geographical location, it sometimes finds itself left off maps of the world. Now, thanks to Wellington’s naive decision to prioritise trade with China over its membership of the elite Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, Ms Ardern can expect her country’s isolation to deepen further as New Zealand faces the very real prospect of expulsion from the alliance over its pro-Beijing stance.The New Zealand Labour leader’s preference for cosying up to China’s communist rulers comes at a time when the consensus among the world’s leading democracies is that Beijing poses the greatest threat to their long-term well-being and prosperity. It is for this reason that leaders of the other members of the Five Eyes alliance – Britain, the US, Canada and Australia – have been pressing for the group to issue a joint communique denouncing Beijing’s suppression of liberty in Hong Kong, as well as its repression of the Uyghur Muslims.This follows the alliance’s decision last year to expand its remit beyond its core role, dating back to its formation during the Second World War, of collecting and sharing intelligence. The network now also seeks to promote “shared values” on democracy and human rights. Yet attempts by the Five Eyes to present a united front against Beijing have been thwarted by the New Zealand government’s preference for maintaining cordial ties with Beijing.It transpires that, rather than supporting efforts by other alliance members to hold Beijing to account over human rights abuses, New Zealand has been reluctant to sign joint Five Eyes statements criticising China.Explaining the decision, the country’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, says her country is “uncomfortable” with expanding the alliance’s role, and that New Zealand should instead pursue its own bilateral relationship with Beijing. At the heart of it is a desire to forge closer trade ties with China, which presently accounts for 29 per cent of New Zealand exports.Wellington’s willingness to ally itself more closely with Beijing has also resulted in accusations that New Zealand is not fulfilling its obligations to protect smaller nations in the Pacific, which have been the target of Beijing’s expansionist designs in the region. However, by pursuing such a patently pro-Beijing outlook, Ms Ardern not only risks undermining Western attempts to present a united front against China. New Zealand’s reluctance to cooperate with other Five Eyes members raises serious questions about its continued membership of the alliance.This is not the first time that the country’s relations with the alliance have been strained. In 2003, serious consideration was given in both London and Washington to ending New Zealand’s Five Eyes membership after Helen Clark, the country’s then Labour prime minister (and Ms Ardern’s political mentor), ordered her country’s intelligence services to scale down their cooperation with Five Eyes because of her opposition to the Iraq war.Ms Ardern’s ill-judged preference for fostering closer ties with Beijing will inevitably reignite the debate in Western intelligence circles as to whether New Zealand, which has long been regarded as the weakest link in the alliance, should retain its membership.While New Zealand’s geographical location makes it a good listening post for the Pacific region, the country’s national security focus is much closer to home, and mainly involves curbing the activities of Maori gangs. The calculation for Western intelligence chiefs, therefore, is whether it is worth persevering with New Zealand’s membership when the Ardern administration has a very different set of policy objectives.Ms Ardern can also expect her pro-human rights credentials to come under closer scrutiny. Previously, Ms Ardern has declared her support for “the values of human rights, social justice, equality, democracy and the role of communities”. How this squares with her aspiration to befriend a Chinese regime that is persisting with its crackdown on Hong Kong’s democracy movement by detaining and imprisoning activists is for the New Zealand electorate to decide.What is not in doubt is that, by seeking closer ties with Beijing, Ms Ardern risks isolating her country from allies like neighbouring Australia, whose own trading relationship with Beijing has suffered heavily because of Canberra’s criticism of China’s attempts to cover up the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as its assault on Hong Kong.We live in an age when, as US President Joe Biden has warned, countries that value democracy need to work together to counter the threat posed by authoritarian regimes like China. By choosing Beijing at the expense of her Five Eyes allies, Ms Ardern risks eroding New Zealand’s credibility on the global political map.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"next derek chauvin","story":"Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering George Floyd on Tuesday, in what was seen as a rebuke of law enforcement\u0027s treatment of black Americans. A 12-member jury delivered guilty verdicts on each of the three charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter against the former Minneapolis police officer.Mr Chauvin was handcuffed immediately after the verdicts were read and was taken into custody. Mr Chauvin, 45, could be sent to prison for decades - but we will not know exactly how long until he is sentenced in June.Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, Mr Chauvin faces at least 12-and-a-half years in prison for his conviction as a first-time criminal offender. But prosecutors could seek a longer sentence of up to 40 years if Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the trial, determines that there were aggravating factors. He will consider that the killing was committed in front of children and that Mr Floyd was treated with “particular cruelty” during the incident, according to court filings by the state. With aggravating factors taken into account Judge Cahill could hand out a maximum sentence of 40 years for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.It will be up to Judge Hill whether the sentences are run consecutively or concurrently, meaning there is a chance Mr Chauvin could be in prison for up to 75 years.Mr Chauvin\u0027s defense team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict, but is considered likely to appeal the conviction.According to legal experts, the former police officer could argue that the jury was prejudiced by media coverage and a settlement in the civil case brought by Mr Floyd\u0027s family, though his odds of success are slim. Mr Chauvin\u0027s attorneys will have to notify the trial court within 60 days if they plan to appeal. His lawyers then have months to review transcripts and court filings dating from the start of the case to build their arguments.A financial settlement was reached with the family while jury selection in the criminal case was under way, something Mr Chauvin\u0027s attorney Eric Nelson said had an incredible propensity to taint a jury pool.Mr Chauvin\u0027s lawyers may also cite Judge Cahill\u0027s decision to hold the trial in Minneapolis as a reason to overturn the conviction. The defence had argued it was impossible to find an impartial jury in the city, which was rocked by protests over Mr Floyd\u0027s death.Another potential point of appeal could be comments made by US Representative Maxine Waters following the police shooting of black man Daunte Wright. Ms Waters urged protesters to get more confrontational if Mr Chauvin was found not guilty during a visit to Brooklyn Centre, Minnesota, over the weekend. On Monday Judge Cahill called her comments abhorrent, though he also denied a request by defence lawyer Mr Nelson to declare a mistrial.I\u0027ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result on this whole trial being overturned, Judge Cahill said.The Minnesota Department of Corrections said Tuesday night that Mr Chauvin was at the state\u0027s maximum security prison in Oak Park Heights, due to an arrangement with the county sheriff and the Department of Corrections. Oak Park Heights is Minnesota’s only Level 5 maximum security facility and is regarded as safest for high-risk offenders. It is highly likely Mr Chauvin will serve his entire sentence in the prison, although there is a chance he could also be transferred to another of Minnesota\u0027s nine state prisons. As Mr Chauvin was convicted in a high profile case and as a police officer it is likely concerns surrounding his safety will need to be addressed. He will be closely monitored and is likely to be considered a suicide risk, meaning officers will conduct regular welfare checks. Mr Chauvin’s cell could also be kept lit at all times. According to a lawsuit in February, eight prison guards filed a lawsuit alleging racial discrimination after they were barred from working on the floor where Mr Chauvin had been held at the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center, before he was transferred to a state prison.They claimed their supervisor believed they could not be trusted to professionally perform their duties around Mr Chauvin because of their racial identities. Now Mr Chauvin has been found guilty, prosecutors will switch their focus to the cases against three other police officers who played a role in Mr Floyd’s arrest. Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng, who were all fired and arrested following Mr Floyd’s death last May, face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.The charge is punishable by up to 40 years in prison, although sentencing guidelines can reduce the maximum to 15 years. The three are currently free on $750,000 bail and their trial is set for August 23.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxfords silicon valley eating green land really needed","story":"Crunch, crack, splinter, grind – this is the sound of progress the noise emitted as a JCB uproots and flattens a stretch of hedgerow, sending a startled rabbit scurrying for safety.Just within the Oxford ring road, a field is being converted into a new urban development grass and trees are being modernised into concrete and steel. Welcome to Oxford North, a 64-acre greenfield site that will soon accommodate offices, laboratories and new homes, a venture described by the local paper as “Oxford’s Silicon Valley”. After a process of nearly a decade, preparatory work has now begun removing medieval hedgerows before the birds’ breeding season begins.Watching on as the bulldozer rumbles is Dr Carol Peaker, who lives nearby. “This is probably the most depressing thing I’ve ever seen,” she says. “Once this has gone, it’s not coming back.”It is a story being replicated across the country. Everywhere, the rural fringe girdling our urban sprawl is being pushed back. In Stockport’s Tame Valley, the Bredbury Park Industrial Estate is seeking to expand. In the West Midlands, hundreds of houses are planned for fields surrounding Halesowen. In Derbyshire, a whole new town is being mooted to fill in the open space along the Amber Valley. As a nation, we have decided this is the way forward.A knock-on effect of the post-pandemic rise of flexible working – in which millions are expected to escape to the country, to endure a longer commute but on fewer days a week – could also see existing commuter belts double in size as living further afield becomes more possible.That is certainly how the work in Dr Peaker’s back yard is being promoted. On the website of Oxford North, it speaks of the development built on an undistinguished triangle of land abutted by three dual carriageways, as “forming the community of the future”. It is illustrated by pictures of how things will look when the complex is complete, full of handsome young inhabitants navigating “Oxford’s new urban district” aboard electric scooters.The identity of the developers here speaks volumes for our changing relationship with the green space abutting our cities. Thomas White Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of Oxford’s St John’s College, named after the man who founded the institution in 1555. St John’s is Oxford’s wealthiest college, sitting on an endowment fund valued at £573 million in 2019. The old saying that it is possible to journey between the two cities solely across fields and land owned by either St John’s Oxford or St John’s Cambridge shows the reach of its property portfolio.Even as it converts its fields, those in charge of the institution suggest St John’s is driven by a pressing urge: the need to keep the university at the top of the world rankings. And ancient buildings that might look quaint through a tourist’s camera are no longer enough to pass muster. What the city needs is state-of-the-art facilities to lure in the investment to back the high-tech discoveries being made in the university’s laboratories. After all, the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine could not be properly developed in medieval courtyards.“This place will be a facilitator for life-changing discoveries,” says Olivia Lane-Nott, spokesperson for the development. “By helping to connect academia and commerce, it will help turn research into successful business. This place will ensure smart young researchers can stay in the city to develop their initiatives.”Hence, the 87,000 square metres of flexible, up-to-the-minute office and laboratory space being built where rabbits once burrowed. Here, it is confidently predicted, some 4,500 well-remunerated jobs will be created.“This is a socio-economic development, investing into Oxford,” adds Lane-Nott. “It is unlocking the future for everybody.”Though according to Nina Vamschiack, a midwife who lives near the new quarter, the pandemic has surely altered that future.“The business case has changed,” she says. “In the last year, people have discovered that they don’t want to go into an office every day, companies have discovered they won’t need so much space. People have seized on a new appreciation of nature. What they want in the future is the chance to breathe. We should pause all this until we have decided exactly what it is we want from now on.”Vamschiack is among a group of local people arguing for pause who gathered last week outside St John’s, placing placards at the college gates. This, they maintain, is the frontline in a new ision between town and gown.“Just wander into the centre of Oxford now and you’ll see how much empty space there is,” she adds. “There’s dozens of empty shops, department stores have closed down, there’s brownfield sites lying disused. The city is being allowed to rot from the middle out while St John’s builds on fields on the outskirts.”It is a claim dismissed by the college. Professor Andrew Parker, the academic in charge of the scheme, insists that, as it did in the 19th century, when it provided land for new women’s colleges in the north of the city, St John’s is realigning its property holdings for the new age.“There is a lot of criticism that claims we are simply producing office space that would be available elsewhere,” he says. “That is categorically not the case. What we are delivering is space for laboratory work alongside support space. It is not the kind of space you can repurpose the centre of the city for. It is certainly not the kind of work you can do at home. This area has been planned for a specific activity whose needs have simply not been met before. And, according to our research, the pandemic has not changed the demand.”The townsfolk, however, are not convinced. They believe St John’s current leadership has reneged on historic responsibilities to preserve the city fabric.“There is a tension, an important tension, between the two aspects of conservation and innovation,” admits Parker. “That tension has driven a lot of our decision making process for this project. We are doing this right. And I think people will come to appreciate this is a facility that will be of huge benefit to the city. Judge us by results, not the fears you have.”Yet, from the moment planning permission was first sought for the site back in 2015, the opposition has been vociferous. In the six years since hundreds have piled into Wolvercote Village Hall for mass meetings, there have been marches and petitions, the local MP Layla Moran has voiced her opposition in Parliament. But, despite all the noise, the scheme is underway.“We are just asking them to pause,” says Peaker, as she places a placard bearing the words ‘The World Has Changed’ at St John’s gates.The problem for protestors against such developments is that their criticism can be easily dismissed as nimbyism. Locals may object, but the council insists it has to take into consideration the wider good, not least the £150 million a year boost to the city’s economy predicted when the site is fully operational.“It’s a cheap accusation to throw that we’re all nimbys. But who else cares about their local area other than local people?” says Helen Marshall, director of the Council for the Protection of Rural England Oxfordshire, who has been prominent in the protest.“What is not being discussed with the public at all about developments like this is that things have changed. What was underlined through Covid is that we are more than ever aware how valuable our green space is. Awareness of its value is being increased precisely at the time it is at greatest risk. We owe it to future generations not to stop fighting to protect it.”Even as the bulldozers move in, it seems the protests will continue. There will be much urging to vote in the forthcoming local elections for candidates opposed to more development. Things could, those against the project believe, be held back even at the last.“Personal and professional embarrassment is a powerful thing they should feel ashamed of this,” says Vamschiack. “We need to keep saying this is not what we want or need.”And she points to the fact that in February, in the village of Fyfield, west of Oxford, a plan to build 650 homes on a greenfield site was thrown out by councillors who had been newly elected on a pledge to put a halt to building. By coincidence, the land that was going to be built on in Fyfield is owned by St John’s College.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"5 ways tories looking shaking","story":"News ways Tories are looking at shaking up UK football as Super League in tattersThe German model, a golden share and improving the experience for fans are all still on the table for reform, despite the plans for a European Super League crashing down last nightmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  APR NewsFans could be handed % ownership or a golden share under plans to be examined by ministers \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Bosses responded to a massive backlash from fans, politicians and footballers themselves over the elite breakaway plot.It came hours after Boris Johnson threatened a bomb of new laws to stop the cartel, and last night he said it was the right result.But ministers today say itaposs not the end and they are now considering what reforms may be needed to the way the sport is run. Sport Minister Tracey Crouch will still lead a fan-led review, which was promised in the  Tory manesto and set up this week. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said it will look at finance, it will look at governance and it will look at the fan experience of football. The withdrawal from the Super League means the biggest threats - windfall taxes, player travel restrictions and withdrawing police support for matches - almost certainly wonapost happen.But there are still some ideas the government is looking at. Here is whataposs believed to be on the table. German-style fan ownership The review led by former Sports Minister Tracey Crouch will look at whether supporters could have a role in owning clubs. One big focus is the ‘German model’ in which fans own at least % of shares and voting rights in their club. This is being examined “very closely” by ministers. Mr Dowden said the fact German clubs were not part of the Super League “rather makes the case” for the German model. “We need to look at options for fans to be able to have stakes in clubs,” he told broadcasters today, adding: Itaposs very important that we donapost see this as the end of the process. He told LBC: I do think it’s right that we look at how fans can have a stake in the game. I thinkyou go back a few years and certainly this is one of the things we discussed with fans, fans did have more of a stake a few years back, over time they’ve been bought out so I think that’s important that we look at that. A aposgolden shareapos model Ministers are also understood to be looking at a golden share model as a possible alternative to Germanyaposs scheme. A golden share is a share of less than %, but which gives the holder powers of veto over major changes to a company. Sosupportersapos groups were to have a golden share in their club, they could block unsavoury changes in ownership for example. A government insider told the Mirror measures will have to show boards can be forced to listen to fans. Ofcom-style regulator An Ofcom-style regulator for football is being considered, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said. The Government has not ruled out the prospect of a new regulatory body, he confirmed, telling LBC: The fan-led review will look at this. Clearly we have got to get a balance. I want the Government to do as little as it has to do. The game is rightly self-governed, but I do think it is right that we look at governance questions like that, and that will not be off the table.

Meanwhile, Carina White is co-founder and host of Black Mums Upfront - an honest and frank podcast about modern-day motherhood, touching on subjects that can be hard to talk about, including death and the experience of losing loved ones.Finally, Helen Chandler is Head of Operations for Co-op Funeralcare, who are committed to supporting people before, during and after the funeral.Everyoneaposs grief is dferent All the experts agree that thereaposs no one-size-fits-all solution for coping with grief. Every experience is unique, and everyoneaposs emotional and physical symptoms are dferent. If we prepare ourselves and talk about this more, we will be more prepared to support ourselves but also to support our loved ones as well, says Carina.  How to REALLY listen to someone whoaposs grieving Supporting a friend through their grief is important - but itaposs often hard to know how. Sometimes saying nothing at all and simply listening is the best approach, according to the experts. What it does is show the bereaved person that the relationship they have with the person who has died really, really matters, Andy explains.  How has the pandemic changed the way we grieve  Itaposs unlikely weaposll know the full effects of the past yearaposs events on bereavement, but it has certainly had an impact. People have been hugely imaginative in terms of the types of services theyaposve arranged, reveals Helen. Lots of families have said that they would be having a memorial service or some kind of event in the future when hopefully the pandemic is over and we are free to move on and that tells me something really important. Those families certainly donapost intend for their grief journeys to be over.

Teacher Sarah Daniels told Daily Mail : As I was looking at the shelves I noticed a tall dark-haired lady further down the aisle and thought to myself ‘I recognise that face’.Mrs Daniels said that at one point, Charlotte sat on the floor and was told by her mother, dressed casually in jeans, low-heeled boots and a jacket: Get up, poppet. George then askedthey could buy some dinosaur slime – a popular school playground fad in Britain – but Mrs Daniels said she didn’t register a response from the Prince’s mother.  She added that when she left The Range a fleet of Range Rovers were parked outside. Mrs Daniels presumed they had transported the royals and their police protection officers to the store.Mondayaposs stationary shopping trip came two days after Kate joined other members of the royal family to say their final goodbyes to Prince Philip at his funeral over the weekend.Kate looked emotional as she sat at her husband Prince Williamaposs side for the service in St Georgeaposs Chapel.

The annual Lyrid meteor shower is described as one of the most signicant showers of the year as people can see up to  meteors in one hour.The shower, which has stunned populations around the world for more than , years, will run from April  to April . But the peak is expected to be in the early hours of April .Nasaaposs website recommends you look out for the striking phenomena in the Northern Hemisphere between moonset and dawn so the moonlight doesnapost obscure your view. While no binoculars or telescopes are needed, gazers should seek to move away from the city to avoid light pollution and bring with them a sleeping bag or a blanket so they can keep warm during the spectacle.Lie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible, NASA said. After about  minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors. Be patient—the show will last until dawn, so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse.While The Royal Greenwich Observatory echoed this as it previously said: The later in the morning you wait, the higher the radiant will rise and the fewer meteors will be hidden below the horizon.But the closer you get to sunrise the brighter the sky is going to become so plan accordingly!  The Lyrid meteors radiate from the constellation Lyra, which can easily be spotted. You’ll want to look for Vega, which is the brightest star in the constellation. The meteors come from cometsapos debris exploding once it enter Earthaposs atmosphere. The cometsapos remains then disintegrate, creating fiery streaks in the sky.

This morning the government announced commitments to put the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by  per cent by  - just  years away. This is the sixth and latest carbon budget setting the country on the way to going net-zero by . While being ambitious is good, how the country meets its goals is the important bit, argues Jonathan Church, a climate accountability lawyer. The new ambition of this target is great but I donapost think it fundamentally changes the picture, he told The Mirror. This target is in line with the net zero target, but it doesnapost change what we need to do to reach net zero by , this is just the next stepping stone. What it will do is make it easier for people to hold governments to account in a general sense.Will you be happy making changes to your lestyle  Join the debate in the comments belowMr Church says it is crucial to address all the dferent high-emissions sectors at once and as quickly as possiblethe target is to be hit. The big parts are buildings, which is to do with decarbonising heating, waste, keeping homes warm, but also road transport as well, such as getting the charging stations going, he continued. We can no longer address these targets one after another, every sector is crucial. We canapost rest on our laurels any longer.The Climate Change Committee , which advises the government, has set out the steps the country needs to take over the next  years to hit the  per cent target.Hereaposs how its recommendations will change Britain...Waste One of the things that will have the biggest impact on Brits will be how we get rid of our rubbish. The amount of waste that needs to be recycled must hit  per cent in England by  and  in Scotland and Wales, according to the CCC. Thataposs a big jump from the current  per cent of household waste that is recycled and means more commitment to sorting bins at home, as well as better waste management plants. All biodegradable waste must be banned from landfill by , meaning no more hauling paper, cardboard, food, textiles, wood and garden wastes to the tip. The CCC has called for a law requiring all businesses to record how much food they waste.Homes Another big problem we have in the UK are our leaky homes. Ambitious plans brought in by Labour to make all new homes carbon neutral from  were scrapped by the Tory government in , paving the way for energy inefficient house building projects. To hit the  target building emissions need to fall by half, meaning no more poorly built homes. Many people will have to swap their gas boilers out when it breaks for a green alternative such as a heat pump, which requires a cleaner form of energy to be viable. According to the CCC one million heat pumps will have to be put in British homes each year until  to hit the target. That means a large metal box which looks like an air conditioning unit being attached to the outside of ten million homes over the next decade. A lot of money needs to be pumped into green home repair and maintenance, which could create a lot of well paid job opportunities.Food One of the biggest drivers of climate change, yet the area we least want to deal with, is undoubtedly food. On the more positive side of things,  per cent of agricultural land in the UK will need to be used to reduce emissions and suck up carbon instead of farming by . For the average non-farming person, that will primarily mean more woodland and peat bogs to stomp around in, which should provide flood protection and animal habitats.  Less welcome will be the news that our diets need to change. The British public will have to eat  per cent less meat and dairy over the next ten years. This either means a fth of the country shoulder the burden and go vegan, or everybody cuts their intake a little. Food waste also needs to be slashed by  per cent.Transport When it comes to flying - which accounts for just . per cent of global emissions but a big chunk of the average Westerneraposs carbon footprint - most of the requirements set out by the CCC are structural and wonapost impact Brits directly. They include developing sustainable plane fuel and stopping the construction of more airports. The CCC also states that the number of flights from UK airports cannot increase by more than  per cent by . One way to do that may be to introduce a frequent fliers tax to stle demand, meaning the more times you jet off each year, the more out of pocket you are. Carbon cutting transport plans will be felt much more keenly on the road.  From  petrol and diesel cars and van sales will be banned, leading Brits towards cleaner electric vehicles. This will cause roads to become much quieter and less polluted. The CCC has urged the government to pump money into the sector to make electric cars and vans more affordable, as they remain out of reach for most people at the moment. Charging stations will become a feature of every road to keep the green fleet going and lorries, which make up five per cent of all vehicles yet produce  per cent of emissions, will become zero-emission. Brits will have to ditch a lot of their short-term car journeys - especially those driving a fossil-fuel powered motor - and walk or cycle instead.Power To hit the  target, Britain has to be on it when it comes to power generation. The CCC recommends “fully decarbonising” electricity generation within  years while meeting a  per cent increase in demand over the same period.

The Duke of Sussex, , is said to have landed at Los Angelesapos airport on an -hour American Airlines flight from London Heathrow on Tuesday, a day before the widowed Queenaposs th birthday. A chauffeur-driven luxury SUV with tinted windows was pictured leaving a private terminal reserved for the rich and famous, and it was later spotted arriving at the Sussexesapos mansion in Montecito about two hours later, MailOnline reported. The driver and front passenger of the black Cadillac Escalade, which is priced from £, brand new, were wearing face masks as the vehicle left Los Angeles International . Flight AA, operating on a Boeing , left Heathrow just before am UK time on Tuesday and touched down at LAX just under  hours later, at .pm local time in Calornia, according to tracking websites. It was Harryaposs first visit to the UK since he and Meghan quit as senior royals a year ago and since their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey widened the rt with Prince William and heightened tensions with the family. His visit was expected to be brief and there were doubts that he would stick around to see the Queen on her birthday. Harry stayed at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, the Sussex family home before they moved to a sprawling mansion in suburban Los Angeles last year, during histo England. Meghan, who is pregnant with a baby girl and is due to give birth this summer, and Archie did not travel back to the UK with Harry. Buckingham Palace said her doctor had advised her not to travel. After a  years of married le, the monarch was marking her first birthday in almost eight decades without her late husband Philip, who died aged  on April . During a private and low-key birthday on Wednesday, four days after the Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral, the Queen was expected to have lunch with close family members at Windsor Castle, video calls with great-grandchildren, and a walk with her dogs on her estate.

The Royal Family is still in an official two-week period of mourning following the dukeaposs death. Meghan sent a handwritten note and a wreath to pay her respects to Philip from across the Atlantic and it was seen amongst others during the televised service at St Georgeaposs Chapel at Windsor Castle. Upon histo the UK, Harry was legally required to self-isolate for  days, though the quarantine period can be shortened to five days with a negative Covid test.Before his flight home, he would have been required to show a negative coronavirus viral test taken within three days of departure.  If Harry hasnapost been vaccinated against Covid-, he should stay away from Meghan for  days upon histo the US from international travel, according to official guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill from coronavirus, the CDC websites states. Unvaccinated people should get tested for Covid within three to five days after travel and self-isolate at home for seven, the guidance states. Those who donapost get tested should self-quarantine for ten days instead of seven. International travellers who are fully vaccinated should get tested within three to five days, and self-monitor for Covid symptoms, according to the guidance. The guidance does not advise them to stay away from pregnant women or others who are at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. The CDC states: You may have been exposed to Covid- on your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still be infected and spread the virus to others.

And as coronavirus restrictions continue it is unclear who,anyone, will be allowed to mark this poignant milestone with her.Even the traditional gun salute will be silenced as the period of royal mourning for Philip lasts until tomorrow. So, as the Queen prepares to celebrate a birthday like no other, we look back at some of her most memorable birthday moments... First birthday What would you like to say the Queen on her birthday  Let us know in the comment section  The Queen spent her first birthday with her grandmother Queen Mary at Windsor Castle while her parents continued a y tour of Fiji, New Zealand and Australia in . th birthday To mark reaching double figures in , she received a miniature car, a bicycle, a big doll, books, a riding crop and furniture for her doll’s house. She spent the morning riding her white pony, Snowball, before an afternoon party. The teen years Turning  in , the young Elizabeth posed for a photo with her family at Windsor Castle. Royal commentator Marcia Moody said: “It was her first birthday since the country had gone to war, and the family portrait would likely to have been to remind the British public that there was a stable and reassuring family unit at the head of the country.” She devoted her th birthday to her duties and carried out her first engagement as honorary Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.  She inspected the soldiers with her father, King George VI, and later attended a reception with entertainers including Vera Lynn. As a gt on her th birthday she was given her first corgi, named Susan. st birthday Elizabeth spent her st birthday on tour in South Africa with her parents and sister Margaret. She made a speech dedicating her le to the commonwealth, saying: “I declare before you all that my whole le whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service.” Her father had made her wait until she turned  to announce her engagement to Prince Philip – which she did in July , three months after her birthday.  th birthday A set of family photos marked the milestone in . As well as a dinner for family and friends, the Queen hosted a ball for  people. A year later she celebrated her Silver Jubilee. th birthday  On the big day in  the Queen appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, who got married later that year. They were greeted with delight and , children holding daffodils sang Happy Birthday to the Queen. th birthday The big day came just months after Princess Diana’s explosive Panorama interview, and the palace decided to keep a low profile. Even the Queen’s planned birthday dinner at the Waterside Inn in Bray, Berkshire, had to be cancelled after plans were leaked to a newspaper. So the meal was transferred to Frogmore House instead. th birthday In  the Queen carried out a traditional -minute walkabout down the main high street in Windsor in front of crowds of , well-wishers. Prince Charles made a televised tribute to his mother, saying she was “an example to so many of service, duty and devotion in a world of sometimes bewildering change and disorientation”. Fans of the royal also showered her with , cards and , emails. In the evening she attended a black-tie dinner of smoked salmon, venison and chocolate cake in Kew Palace, which was hosted by Prince Charles. th birthday  In  the Queen became the first British monarch to celebrate her th birthday. Thousands of well-wishers lined the streets as a national service of thanksgiving was held at St Paul’s Cathedral. The Queen lit the first of hundreds of beacons set up across the country and overseas to mark the day. th birthday  Last year heralded a break from birthday traditions due to the pandemic. The Queen’s birthdays are usually marked by gun salutes in Hyde Park and at the Tower of London. But in , for the first time since she began her reign, they did not go ahead. The Queen was adamant that there “would be no special measures which would go against government coronavirus restrictions”.  Instead, she and Prince Philip spent lockdown at Windsor Castle together and marked the Queen’s milestone in private – with a slice of her favourite chocolate cake. Her Majesty was sorely missed by other members of her family. Royal author Leslie Carroll said at the time: “Both William and Kate are very close to their respective families, so it must be extremely dficult for them not to see them, and for their children not to be able to spend time with them as well.” Instead, the Queen enjoyed several video calls with family members. And as lockdown continues, this seems likely to be the case today, too.Queenaposs f avourite cake recipe Former royal chef Darren McGrady reveals the Queen’s favourite chocolate cake recipe that dates back to .

The Monarch will spend the day privately, enjoying a lunch with a few members of her family. The royals have come up with a rota for walks during the day to ensure sheaposs not alone, with Princess Anne, the Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie Wessex coming together to devise a plan. But while today is the Queenaposs real birthday, she has another later in June - her official birthday. The tradition of Monarchs having a second birthday was introduced  years ago and itaposs still going strong - but why  Well, in what may be one of the most British excuses ever, itaposs all because of the weather. Since , Kings and Queens have marked their big day with the Trooping the Colour parade. But Edward VII, who reigned from  to , was born in November - which obviously isnapost the best time of year for a huge outdoor celebration. So instead, he moved Trooping of the Colour to May or June because there was less chance of it being cold and drizzly on the big day.  The monarch after Edward VII - George V - helpfully had a birthday in June, but the Queenaposs father, George VI, whose birthday was in December, reintroduced the tradition of an official birthday, which Elizabeth II has continued. There isnapost a set date for the Queenaposs official birthday, and it is instead typically held on the second Saturday of June. George VI used to do it on the second Thursday of the month, but the Queen changed it to the weekend for convenience. Trooping the Colour, a military parade which dates back to the th Century, is a highlight in the royal calendar.

Thirteen-year-old Richard Bellamy was thrilled when the -year-old paid a visit to his school. It was  - decades before the mobile phone camera revolution - but that didnapost stop the thrilled teenager from capturing a photo of the new Queen. Richard, who is in his s and from Grimsby, kept the photo under wraps for almost seven decades so has revealed it for the first time to mark the Queenaposs th birthday on Wednesday.The Queen visited Shrewsbury School with the late Prince Philip on October ,  - shortly after her father King George VI died and months before her coronation took place on June , .Richard told Grimsby Live : “Photos at the time were rare and this was taken by holding my box camera above my -year-old head.What do you think  Have your say in comments below  “This has never been published before, as far as I know.” The black and white image captures the young royal looking to the side with her handbag resting on her elbow. The Queen made her visit during Richard’s first-term at the private boarding school in Shropshire when they had around  pupils. The Royals spent about  minutes in the library viewing manuscripts, early books and bindings.  The students also enjoyed a mass PT display, the Guard of Honour, the opening of the Queen’s Terrace, and a chapel service, where the schoolboys joined together to sing the National Anthem. A statement on Shrewsbury School’s website reads: “As a postscript to this Royal day, a group of boys, finding the sherry which the Queen and the staff had enjoyed unattended in the Moser Buildings, felt there would be no harm in joining in the general festivities with a loyal toast.” In the months following the Queen’s visit, Richard recalls being called into the headmaster’s office. He added: “He shouted ‘Bellamy’ and I thought ‘Oh no, what have I done’.”  But instead of receiving a scolding, Richard was handed a letter from the Lady-in-Waiting sent via Windsor Castle. Richard added: “You will see the great letter I got back from Windsor Castle saying she really liked it.” The letter from Windsor Castle reads: “Dear Richard, “I write at The Queen’s command to thank you for your letter, and for your very kind thought in sending the delightful photograph of Her Majesty.  “The Queen has much pleasure in accepting this, and bids me send you her sincere thanks. “Yours sincerely, Lady-in-Waiting.” Richard, who worked as the High Sherf in Humberside in , proudly displays his photograph and his accompanying letter in his home.

But despite the painful experiences weaposve all suffered first-hand, an expert study has found that hangover severity declines with age. Looking at feedback collected from  people with an age range of  to  years old, it says that when participants consumed the same amount of booze, older people suffered less the following day. It put this partly down to a decline in pain sensitivity as we age, hinting that we simply get better at dealing with it as we get older.  The research, titled Alcohol Hangover Across the Lespan: Impact Of Sex and Age, said one of the biggest contributing factors to suffering worse hangovers in our younger days simply came down to drinking more in a shorter space of time.Although the amount of alcohol people consume each week was found to increase with age, it suggests we go for more of a little and often approach spread out over more days as opposed to a heavy session or two. In general, younger age groups suffered worse hangovers for three glaring reasons: they drink more alcohol in one sitting, they do it in a shorter period of time, and they get more drunk.

When she went to look for Jolene, she found a dog bone and an unsealed envelope containing a note which had been dropped over the garden fence. The note indicated that her Portuguese podengo puppy had been poisoned, with the badly typed message reading: Your dog is to be poisoned, to much barking, sorry but no choice, your falt.  Cheri rushed her dog to the vets, where Jolene was induced to vomit and spent a day undergoing treatment, as reported by News.Thankfully, the pet made a full recovery but Cheri was left with a bill and no idea who had targeted Jolene, saying she has never had problems with her neighbours previously. Police told News that they are investigating the allegations and that the dog is now fine and well. Cheri said she recognised the bone to be one specically made for dogs and added the person responsible must have gone to a pet shop to find one before dropping it into her garden.

thing – for Dundee all it’s done has pile on the pressure ahead of a crunch clash in the Highlands on Tuesday.The Dark Blues had their metaphorical feet up on Saturday.Rivals Raith, however, were picking up yet another impressive three points on the road to secure themselves a play-off spot.And in the process put themselves in control of the race for second place.After any hopes of a title challenge disappeared early doors for the Dark Blues, second place and one less play-off was then the target.To achieve that now will require perfection – something Dundee have been far from this season.Three games to go with a five-point gap to make up, with one of those against the Kirkcaldy side.Only three wins out of three will do.And that means going to Inverness and having all three points tucked up and sleeping soundly coming back down the long and winding A.However, they will have to buck the historical trend to do so – Dundee have never won a league match away to Inverness Caledonian Thistle.They did win a Scottish Cup replay up there in  with current Caley interim boss Neil McCann in charge and Thistle midfielder Scott Allan the scorer.That’s  league trips to the Highland capital and very little success – including the - draw up there earlier in the campaign.On top of that McCann has Caley Thistle flying up the league – four wins on the bounce before a draw at Queen of the South last time out.Amongst all that have been cup wins at Buckie Thistle, rivals Ross County and a near-thing over the weekend at St Mirren.Falling so far behind Hearts has already been admitted as an underachievement by Dens gaffer James McPake.To finish behind a team who played in League One last season would be yet another disappointment.However, the positive for the Dark Blues is they have it in their own hands to turn this season into a success come May.Because they have been playing well themselves, despite draws in the last two outings.And the quality is there throughout the squad at Dens Park.Earning a first league victory in Inverness would set up an all-or-nothing clash with Raith Rovers at Dens Park on Saturday – six points would see Dundee in second place with a game to go.This is where they need their big players to come up with the goods in key moments.The next two games will decide the fate of the Dark Blues, whether it’s second place, third or fourth or the unlikely dismay of missing out on the play-offs altogether.The next two matches are also dry runs for possible play-off match-ups, it’s up to Dundee to prove they have what it takes to win the big games to come.And that starts in the Highlands on Tuesday. The day Dundee played a home match at Tannadice: ‘We thought it was a great place to play!’\" title\"#The day Dundee played a home match at

from Dundee United tomorrow night – all their focus now has to be on the Scottish Cup.Micky Mellon’s men take on Kilmarnock in the Premiership on Wednesday.Then it’s a trip to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final at Pittodrie on Sunday.And I know which match I would be focusing heavily on.I wouldn’t pretend to know Mellon’s mind but I’d be playing some fringe players and youngsters at Rugby Park.Premiership safety is assured already and one bad result can be rectiedthey want to finish seventh.Measure up a seventh-placed Premiership finish and a cup run, though, and there is no comparison.Getting to the semi-finals – and maybe beyond – would cap what has been a very fineto top-flight football for Dundee United.The Dons will be tough opponents at the weekend but there’s no reason United can’t win up there.They’ve shown this season they can raise their game against better opposition and have done well against Aberdeen already.It’ll be interesting to see the impact Stephen Glass has on things at Pittodrie.They’ll get a bounce with a new boss in charge but I think it might be a good thing for the Tangerines the game is coming around so soon.The Dons scored twice at the weekend but they are not a free-scoring side.Neither are United, to be fair.But I see no reason why the Tangerines can’t get a semi-final place booked.Performances lately haven’t been great but they are still picking up points and grinding out wins.The victory at Forfar wasn’t exactly a classic but they got the job done and that’s all that matters in the cup.The same can be said about the win at Hamilton the week before – all that mattered was assuring Premiership football for another season.With that in mind, I’ve not too many worries about United at Aberdeen.Because they’ve shown under Mellon they can pick up points whether playing well or not.They also have men up front who are needing to get on the scoresheet.Marc McNulty will be thinking about where he might be next season and wouldn’t mind finishing off with some goals.And Lawrence Shankland most certainly needs to find goalscoring formhe is to find his way back into the Scotland squad for the Euros.Grabbing a key goal in the big Scottish Cup match at Pittodrie wouldn’t go amiss.I do think he will be in the squad this summer still.There is competition for him, which is why he needs to hit the goal trail.I said before the last squad was announced I thought Shankland had done enough to be included.Steve Clarke went another way so you never really know.But the only way for the striker to make sure is to fire in some goals in key matches.I wrote last week that Dundee couldn’t afford any slip-ups in the chase for second place.And last Tuesday showed exactly why I was worried.The Dark Blues played OK at Dunfermline but were held to a draw.And I fully expected Raith Rovers to kick on in their matches.Now they have a five-point lead ahead of tonight’s meeting between Dundee and Inverness.What a great position for John McGlynn’s side to be in.However, despite James McPake’s side falling further behind Raith, not much has changed for Dundee.It was always the case that they would have to win these gamesthey were to finish in second.And they’ve done alright against Inverness so far this term, beating them last month and drawing - up there earlier in the season.However, there is always a psychological barrier ahead of the long journey to Ross County or Inverness.And that means Dundee will have to be mentally strong to go up there and get the result they need.The good thing is they’ve been showing some mental strength in recent weeks with some good comebacks.Then it’s Raith on Saturday.SoDundee don’t get second place they can only blame themselves.However, I do have a good feeling about the Dark Blues – I think they’ll come good.This European Super League idea just sums up football right now – it’s all about money.There’s no consideration made for the traditional football fan or the history of the game, it’s just about squeezing as much dosh out of the business as possible.In Scotland, we’re lucky to still have local fanbases and you can tell when you’re at matches because of the atmosphere.When you go to English Premier League matches, it is sterile and there is a distinct lack of identity.This is another step away from that. Now the EPL is just a tourist destination. CALUM WOODGER: Whatever happens with Doncaster Micky Mellon has Dundee United in a better place and why Lee Ashcroft is Dundee#s Michael Jordan\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: Whatever happens with Doncaster Micky Mellon has Dundee United in a better place and why Lee Ashcroft is Dundee#s Michael Jordan# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-united-micky-mellon-doncaster-dundee-fc-lee-ashcroft embed # secretyDzMRFKV\" data-secret\"yDzMRFKV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-happened-city-tried-lead-way-housing","story":"IN , housing in Glasgow changed forever."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-dior-models-rock-runway-1955","story":"RENFREW Airport had never looked quite so stylishhellip"},{"url":null,"title":"susan-baird-glasgow-lord-provost-never-forgot-east-end-roots","story":" GLASGOWrsquoS longest serving councillor of modern times and the cityrsquos second female Lord Provost was a bold and bright breath of fresh air in local politics.

it’s not the problem of the landowner.“They’re the ones who need to do something about it.“They need to put in a marshal in and make some changes.”Long queues started formingat the branch last week when the chain launched an offer for p drinks.The discounted coffees led to huge tailbacks on Denmore Road and Ellon Road, with a number of near-misses reportedly involving cars leaving the queues nearly being hit by fast-moving vehicles.The situation was branded “very, very dangerous” by Mr Reynolds, who pushed for changes to be made in the layout of the carpark.Owners of the carpark, Greenridges, agreed, and on Friday evening some changes were implemented on a trial basis.However it seems these have not solved the problems, as the gridlock continues.“Thanks to the changes, shoppers parked in the disabled spots outside retailers such as M#S and Home Bargains are now unable to get out,” said Mr Reynolds.“There have been lots of complaints. One woman was there for  minutes, and another waited  minutes, which is ridiculous.”In an attempt to relieve traffic, the wide single lane Costa customers used to queue in has now been turned into two lanes.One is labelled for drive-through customers and the other is for access to the rest of the car park.Queues often formed next to disabled parking spaces, but because it was a wide lane the drivers were able to squeeze out.Now the space is extremely tight due to the changes, giving less space for cars trying to leave.“People in the Costa queue just won’t let folk out,” Mr Reynolds said.“I don’t understand it because they won’t lose their place, they’ve just got to keep back a little bit and let people out. It so self-centred on these people’s parts.”An M#S spokeswoman said: “We are aware some customers had problems exiting our accessible parking spaces over the weekend and we are keen to resolve this.#We are in regular contact with the car park owners and we are encouraged they are listening. We welcome further testing of new layouts.”The discount coffee deal is now over but the chaos it created has brought the ongoing problems in this car park into focus.“The general problemhas been resolved to a certain extent, and they’ve put in a pedestrian area so people feel safe to walk. But twice at the weekend, there were queues back onto Denmore Road again,” Mr Reynolds said.“Costa#s footfall must be huge compared to when they first opened and there’s even more residential houses coming – there are another  houses planned on the B where you get to Sheilhill Road.“And on the other side of the roundabout, the industrial estate is growing so there will be more building going on there over the next couple of years too.“Costa is only going to be getting busier.”In response, Costa say they are very concerned about the ongoing issues with the car park and want to see things improve for all the retail units there.A Costa Coffee spokesperson said: “We continue to work with the management of the Bridge of Don Retail Park to support the introduction of new measures to help with local traffic flows.#As part of our ongoing commitment to the local community, we will monitor this situation closely and work with the other retailers to identy solutions that work for all of our customers and visitors to the retail park.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59152207-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59152207-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59152207-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.59152207-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"north east community projects invited to apply for funding schemes","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remCouncil officials have invited community projects and organisations in the north-east to apply for funding.Aberdeenshire Council#s Marr Area Committee approved funding for both its small and large grant schemes at the end of last month.The large grant scheme provides funding of up to £, towards projects within the Marr area which aim to improve communities.It aims to deliver projects around the following priorities: empowered and confident communities, economically vibrant communities, healthy, safe and thriving communities, connected communities and natural heritage and environment.Grants of up to £, will also be available through the small grant scheme, and will follow the same criteria.Applications are now being invited from groups in the Marr area.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

draw after extra-time, the Reds netted all five spot kicks to triumph - in the shoot out.From netting just three goals in the preceding  games, the Dons scored twice for the first time since January and were also lethal from the penalty spot.Campbell reckons theto form has arrived at the right time as Aberdeen bid to  end the season on a high with the fight for third still alive and a Scottish Cup quarter-final slot secured.He said: “I think we’re beginning to turn a corner.“Confidence is starting to come back up again and we’ve been scoring goals again, which has been good.“I’ve really enjoyed working with the new staff, even though we’ve only had a few days on the training pitch.“We had a good result at the weekend.“We’re just hoping that we can continue a good bit of form to finish the season on a high.”Aberdeen trail third-placed Hibs by four points with four Premiership matches remaining.Hibs host Livingston in an earlier kick-off today .Campbell believes the Easter Road can still be overtaken.He said: “We haven’t given up on third place.“We know obviously that we’re going to have to take as much points as possible to put pressure on Hibs, but we’re confident that we can still catch them.“We’ve got the Scottish Cup to look forward to as well.” | Scottish Cup -

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream continues for bob","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Other villagers have complained, among other things, about current noise levels from the quarry already being far too high and being heard inside homes # including a th century castle.According to some residents, retired villagers can no longer enjoy sitting outside their homes because of the sound of crushing machines.There was upset recently when the quarry upped its noise limit to  decibels without the nearby community getting a say.#That is the limit for quarries in rural areas but this is not a rural area, this is a village. The quarry is just  metres away,# said Simon Hunt, who runs  luxury accommodation at Kilmartin Castle with his partner Stef Burgeon. The couple have expressed fears the racket from the quarry could damage their business and threaten future growth plans.However, a report from council officers said noise mitigation measures had been invested in by the quarry  and that the most recent assessment demonstrated that it was having the desired effect with the works #practically inaudible# at the survey locations. Environmental Health was also content with those findings.Ms Burgeon and Mr Hunt say the only sound-proofing that has gone up so far at the quarry is scaffolding with insulation board cable tied to it.A council spokesperson told The Oban Times: #There are separate ongoing investigations by the council’s environmental health service under the Environmental Protection Act  which are still to be concluded.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

Some indication of Scott Parkrsquos status within the current and proposed Development Plans would also have aided transparency.ldquoNowhere do I see any attempt to reuse any of the existing buildings, which you might think might be a compelling reason in sustainability terms to examine this site rather more closely in the initial site search.ldquoAnd without a detailed brief being indicated, not only is it dficult to look at the fit and design options of the ious sites, but also it is unclear as to the centralisation of community facilities proposed here.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe council has made use of an online digital exercise supplemented with an unmanned exhibition in the Galashiels Transport Interchange to provide a robust consultation.ldquoWe would like to place on record our thanks to all of the people that have taken the time to submit comments on the proposals since the consultation went live on March .Anyone interested in making a comment can do so through the link on the councilrsquos website or directly to Galacampus@scotborders.gov.ukldquoFollowing the closure of this initial phase of the consultation, the feedback will be reflected upon and used to help prepare a report to the council in late spring recommending the next steps for the project.The full letter from Charles StrangI write on behalf of Scottish Borders Greens to draw your readersrsquo attention to the imminent closing date for submissions on the proposals for the ldquonew Gala Academy.Comments are due in on or before Monday  April. It has been suggested where, and in the columns of local newspapers, that this consultation is a sham.Why is it important that readers take the time and make the effort to respond to this consultation  It is not because the consultation itself has great merit.The Council itself has taken planning advice from consultants which tells them effectively that they need pay no attention to the results of any consultation.It may be that they have sought this independent advice because their own planners have maintained their professional judgements that the proposed site, given in perpetuity to the people of Galashiels as a ldquopleasure ground, is a key green space which should continue to be maintained as such.That is how they have described it in the recent consultative draft Local Development Plan, and no doubt in Development Plans before that.The Council appears reluctant to share their brief for this major improvement in secondary school provision for the Galashiels catchment area.It seems unlikely that, as has been suggested, there is no brief for this multi million pound expenditure: some form of brief would be essential to assess even one single option, never mind a range.Another useful role for any brief would be to examine the potential for retention of any of the educational facilities which already comprise the secondary school campus. This is a particularly important aspect when one considers the amount of embodied energy present in the existing buildings on the site. Plainly when one is addressing the sustainability of any development the existing buildings and site characteristics are critical factors.No, on the face of it this is not a genuine consultation, but a hollow exercise seeking to justy an Education Authority taking the easy option of expanding onto a greenfield site just because they think they can.The people who care about public open space, and trust in local government, should still be seeking to make their voices heard."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-sees-no-cases-recorded-last-24-hours","story":"NO cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the last  hours.The Scottish Government released the latest data at pm today .There have now been , cases of COVID-in the region since the start of the pandemic ndash an increase of one over the weekend.Nationally, , positive cases have been recorded since March last year.According to the most recent data, there are still fewer than five people in hospital in the Borders with the virus.This has been the case every day through March and April, .You might also be interested in:Borders could get pound.m boost from major eventset for region, says councilBorders considers hiring empty homes officerto bring end to vacant propertiesMan assaulted partner and then gave abuse to nursesat Borders General Hospital"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-parliament-election-borders-candidates-hustings","story":"IN the lead-up to next monthrsquos Scottish Parliament elections, three hustings relevant to Borders voters will be held in the coming days.Tomorrowat .pm a virtual hustings over Zoom will be hosted by Borders environmental group Tweedgreen and Tweeddale Peace Group.This meeting will cover the constituency of Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.All constituency candidates have been invited, with organisers saying questions will ldquofocus on the climate, peace and justice ndash all fundamental issues that are interlinked with the climate crisis, the COVID pandemic, and a green and just recovery from their effects.On Thursday eveningthe Liberal Democratsrsquo candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, Catriona Bhatia, will participate in a National Farmers Unionhustings at pm .A spokesperson for the NFU said: ldquoThis webinar will give members the opportunity to hear from and question the lead rural affairs candidates from each of the five main parties.And on April  there will be a West Linton event held over Zoom between .pm-pm.The third Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale hustings will welcome candidates from the five main parties represented at this yearrsquos election ndash more candidates could be added before the event.To join tomorrows Tweedgreen event and submit questions, email: tweedgreenpeebles@googlemail visit the NFU Scotland Facebook page to access the Zoom link for Thursdayrsquos hustings and to join the West Linton meeting, register at: tinyurl wlhustings and send questions to westlintonhustings@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"broughton-john-buchan-way-trees-plan-opposed-campaigners","story":"PROPOSALS to plant trees in a National Scenic Areain the Borders have been met with opposition from locals.The plans for Peeblesshires John Buchan Way involve afforestation across  hectares, mainly for commercial purposes to produce timber, while native broadleaves will also be planted.The new woodland creation would be set ldquowithin the property at Broughton Hope and would see trees planted in one of the Borders two National Scenic Areas.With the consultation process having started, Broughton Community Council was contacted by RDS Forestry, leading to opposition from the community.Fiona Pagett, who has lived in Broughton for  years, has set up a Facebook group called lsquoSave our Glen - JBWrsquo which now has more than  members.:Outcry over bizarre plans to demolish historic mansion near the BordersldquoIrsquom incredibly heartened, though not remotely surprised, at the immediate and enormous opposition to the planting proposal at Broughton Hope, said Ms Pagett, an estate agent.ldquoWe are becoming engulfed in Sitka spruce plantations as the Scottish Government ploughs towards its spurious target of mass planting in the belief this will solve climate change.ldquoIt is disregarding our treasured and erse landscape and threatening much flora and fauna, added Ms Pagett, who lives in the village with her son Angus and daughter Katie.ldquoI have high hopes that this particular proposal, which affects the John Buchan Way, local residents, the shepherd and would negatively impact tourism, will gain the attention of those able to stop it in its tracks.According to Ms Pagett, -year-old shepherd Geordie Wilsonrsquos role ldquowill be removedthe proposals on the land go ahead.

He worked extremely hard behind the scenes to ensure the smooth running of the organisation and was always striving to raise extra funds to provide the youngsters with the very best.#What you saw is what you got with John, and I#m sure everyone who knew him would agree with that.#John was a proper family man, who cared greatly for his loved ones and would always share stories about his grandchildren.#He was very supportive within the community, with all sporting activities, and encouraged the positive impact of sport for young people.#His passion was rugby and he made a real effort to talk to everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him.#John will be greatly missed by all the children, coaches and supporters of the club, and also within our community.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All money raised will be kept in the area.She said: #Unfortunately, the diagnosis for Dad was too late, but I know how crucial the service Macmillan provides within the rural community is for all families.#Therefore, my aim is to raise awareness and as much money as possible for Macmillan Cancer Support with all money staying in Argyll and Bute. This money is invaluable in supporting families living with cancer locally.#Lindsay is inviting as many people as possible to join her — in a socially distanced manner — for the full walk or as many or few sections as they like.It will be an early rise for those wanting to do the first leg, as the walk is set to begin at .am.The approximate leaving times from Westport for the remaining sections are: .am, .am, .pm and .pm. Further details will be shared nearer the time.There is no need to sign up. Those wishing to join Lindsay on her walk should just show up at one or all of the starting times. Light refreshments will be provided throughout the day.Lindsay#s sister-in-law Leighann Burns, who has been helping promote the challenge, said: #This is a great opportunity for people of all ages to get together to raise money for an invaluable community service.#It would be lovely to see as many people locally take part on the day, socially distanced of course.#Donations can be made on the day or via Lindsay#s JustGiving page. Search #Lindsay Ramsay Walk at Westport# on www.justgivingLindsay is well on her way towards her fundraising target, having already received donations amounting to more than £ by the time the Courier went to press.A Macmillan Cancer support spokesperson said: #At Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we#ve got. If you are diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We do whatever it takes. But without your help, we can#t support everyone who needs us.#The charity#s Kintyre fundraising group usually holds annual events to raise essential funds but this has not been possible during the Covid- pandemic, so Lindsay#s challenge will provide a welcome boost."},{"url":null,"title":"tennis players return to the sport they love","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There was mention the flat had not been used much for the purpose of respite for islanders.However, a report before IJB members said the lack of consultation over it closing had caused community concern. The meeting was told there had been #a mix up# over communicating what was happening with islanders.Councillor Mulvaney said he did not feel the flat merited still being in the budget. #We should have saved this [the money] a number of years ago,# he said.Councillor Currie said: #The flat has been used, not much, but it has been used. Everyone is accepting it could have been advertised better.#It was Mid Argyll councillor Sandy Taylor who asked for the service level agreement for the advocacy service to be spared from the savings option list as #a contribution to mental health.#MID ARGYLL AND ISLAY:People across Mid Argyll and Islay have had their mental health boosted thanks to the innovative #Take  Challenge# which began in Kintyre.Inspired by Campbeltown Tesco manager David Brown#s personal K-a-day challenge in , mental health network ACUMEN, in conjunction with Kintyre Link Club, organised the initiative encouraging more people to #take five# each day –  five minutes of walking, five deep breaths of fresh air or a five-kilometre walk or run – with the aim of boosting wellbeing.After success in Kintyre, ACUMEN mental health development worker Sarah McFadzean rolled the challenge out across Mid Argyll and Islay, where people are encouraged to support one another in their challenges by way of a dedicated Facebook group.Where possible, people have been able to meet in twos and, as restrictions change, it is hoped opportunities for groups to Take  together will increase as the initiative moves to the Oban, Lorn and the Isles area in June.Sarah said: #Being involved and enjoying the challenge is as important as the activities themselves.#I would like to thank everyone who supported and got involved in Take  for their enthusiasm and assistance.#We are in the process of developing a Mental Health Forum and Lived Experience Group in the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Isles, the purpose of which will be to gather thoughts on current service provision, listen to others# experiences and inform future planning, along with providing information from a range of services and peer support.#For more information contact sarah.mcfadzean@acumennetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He says the ft steel vessel was equivalent in the area to a ft wooden boat.Mr Howarth also had inquiries about ft in .A design of a conventional type fishing boat has just been completed at the yard.In all, eight definite enquiries were made after fishermen had seen the Strathyre  at the quayside.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThe Orange Lodge Bowling Club is having a social gathering in the Orange Hall on Friday night.The annual meeting of the Penny Savings Bank will be held in the Coffee Room on Tuesday next at noon.A call is made for an accession to the ranks of special constables in the town, and citizens who are willing to give this form of services in the present emergency should inform Superintendent Paterson of the fact with as little delay as possible.The weather has been playing evil tricks this weekend.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone.

So many people have been part of these years and there are many memories to look back on, so many people to thank who have supported us in many dferent ways.We won awards for helping older people – Herald Society in  and Age Scotland in , raised funds with raffles, walking, running, getting covered in mud, quizzes, bingo, making and selling fairy doors, alpacas, books and eggs. We have celebrated birthdays, weddings, Christmases, Easters and any day we can! There has been laughter and sadness, fun, hope and joy.It was  when the seeds were planted at the South Kintyre Fit Communities about the need to develop a shopping service to help older people on discharge from hospital, no longer able to drive or to carry heavy bags.Since then, we have provided not just a shopping service but a number of social activities and housekeeping throughout Kintyre. We have developed the #Making Kintyre Dementia Friendly# project to help all parts of the community to have an understanding of dementia and how it can be managed. We have worked with children of all ages, meeting and helping the older generation and look forward to doing so again.Covid- has changed all our lives and we have had to adapt to dferent ways of keeping in touch and keeping busy. Phone Buddies was set up and we had a monthly virtual tea.However, our plans – started last year – to celebrate our th anniversary with parties has had to be cancelled but we are marking the occasion with a specially made mug by Simon Rochford of Campbeltown Pottery.Thanks to everyone who has been involved in any way with Shopper-Aide – it has been and, I hope, will continue to be, a help to the older generations in Kintyre.So here is to the next  years."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"happy monday scotlands grand reopening","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations

social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"groundwork-begins-new-46m-high-school-wallyford","story":"The new Wallyford Secondary Learning Campus will be built on farmland west of Masons Way and is expected to take about two years to build.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said that the preparatory groundworks would include the erection of fencing around the perimeter, and excavation and removal of topsoil.

If yoursquove never tried growing tomatoes, this could be the year to have a go!Getting startedSome gardeners begin with seed but ensuring the correct temperatures for germinating tomato seeds can be tricky. We find that most people prefer to buy their tomatoes as young plants, and these are available in pots at this time of year. Buying tomatoes as young plants also gives gardeners the opportunity to mix and match dferent ieties.Therersquos a vast range of ieties to choose from, which at first may seem quite disconcerting. So start by considering the type of tomato you prefer and the space you have available to grow them.Generally speaking, tomatoes are either grown on a single, upright stemor as a bush.If itrsquos your first time growing tomatoes, it might be easier to begin with one of the bush ieties, but read on and decide for yourself!Bush tomatoesTwo of our most popular bush-type ieties are lsquoTumblerrsquo and lsquoTumbling Tom Redrsquo but seedsmen are always improving ieties so take time to read the labels on the plants in the garden centre before making your choice.Bush tomatoes tend to have a slightly weeping habit, making them well-suited to being grown in pots, window boxes or hanging baskets. They tend to be relatively compact plants with numerous sideshoots producing clusters of tomatoes.Upright tomatoesAmongst the upright ieties lsquoAlicantersquo, lsquoMoneymakerrsquo and lsquoShirleyrsquo are well tried-and-tested, producing a good crop of full size, red tomatoes.For cherry tomatoes, lsquoGardenerrsquos Delightrsquo is by far the most popular choice amongst our customers.Upright tomatoes can be grown in pots, grow-bags or directly into the ground. As the plant grows, the stem needs to be kept straight so that it can bear the weight of the tomatoes and will require support either by canes or string.To maintain the strength of the main stem, sideshoots need to be nipped out. Sideshoots are the little shoots that appear in the angle between the leaf and the main stem and, as any tomato grower will tell you, itrsquos a job that requires to be done very regularly!Other ietiesTherersquos also a wide selection of yellow, beef-steak, plum and other distinctive ieties to choose from, so take your time to read the labels and choose the ieties that will best suit you, your garden and your family.CultivationAll tomatoes like a warm, sunny location to grow. Outdoor-grown tomatoeswill have to be well-sheltered, although there still needs to be some movement of air to avoid disease.Watering needs to be consistent and regular, and tomatoes growing in pots or growbags will benefit from having a tray underneath to provide a reservoir that they can draw from between waterings. Avoid irregular watering, as it results in uneven growth and may cause the tomatoes to split.Once you see the first bunch of yellow flowers appear, thatrsquos your first tomatoes on they way! The flowers will die off and the little tomatoes will begin to form ndash thatrsquos when gardeners will happily report that ldquothe first truss has set!Once the first truss is set, yoursquoll need to provide additional feeding and this is best done in liquid form whilst watering using a specialist feed such as the well-respected lsquoTomoritersquo, for example.As the season progresses, you may decide to remove some of the older leaves to let more light in and help the fruit ripen. For tomatoes that havenrsquot ripened at the end of the season, use them in the green for chutney or bring them indoors and leave them on the windowsill to ripen.And then...If yoursquove enjoyed growing your own tomatoes and plan to do it again next year, make sure that you remove the old plants completely so that yoursquore not leaving any rotting vegetation and disease that could affect next yearrsquos tomatoes.As always, the plant team are always very happy to help with tips and advice ndash so much easier now that wersquore allowed to be open again, of course!Yoursquoll also find lots of information on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"doors-reopening-dirleton-castle-tantallon-castle","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandis preparing to open the gates to more than  ticketed sites, including Tantallon Castle, near North Berwick, and Dirleton Castle, across the country this month.The historic sites will open on April  following the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed dates for the reopening of the tourism sector and mainland Scotland moving to Covid protection level three.New technology is also being implemented as part of HESrsquos new visitor offering.Visitors will be able to explore the stories of many of the sites in innovative ways through downloadable maps, family trails, quizzes and quests, music, poetry and personal accounts to tell stories throughout the centuries, videos exploring Gaelic culture and words, and digital fly-throughs to areas usually restricted to visitors.Visitors will be able to enjoy access to the historic outdoor spaces at both sites, as well as the Doocot, Gazebo, Hallyburton Range and first floor of the Ruthven Range at Dirleton Castle.All visitors, including members, will be required to pre-book tickets online and to use contactless payment where possible one-way systems will be implemented in some locations visitors must wear face coverings in any indoor enclosed spaces, including retail and catering areas and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: ldquoWe know how keen our members and visitors are to get back to our sites, so wersquore delighted to reopen over  per cent of our properties on April .ldquoScotlandrsquos heritage sector is a key part of our tourism offer ndash from providing jobs to increasing our wellbeing ndash and, in addition to reopening the sites that reopened last year, we will also reopen further sites on a phased basis over the upcoming months.Tantallon Castle will open daily, am-pm, from April , while Dirleton Castle will open on the same date and from then on will be open Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays between the same times.For more information, go to restarthistory.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prince-philips-visits-east-lothian","story":"On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed the news of his death, mere months before his th birthday, saying that he passed away peacefully last Friday morning at Windsor Castle.Since then people across the world have been sharing their condolences and been paying tribute to the late Duke, including here in East Lothian.Over the years the Duke of Edinburgh has visited East Lothian on several occasions, both solo and with the Queen, to whom he was married to for more than  years.From Haddington and North Berwick to Musselburgh and the opening of Yellowcraig Caravan Park in , he has visited several parts of the county over his  years.One of his first visits is believed to be in  with the then Princess Elizabeth, a year before her coronation.Over the years he re-visited the county on several occasions.Another was  when he inspected the British Legion parade in North Berwick, he also opened Yellowcraig Caravan park in .He has also visited Haddington on numerous occasions, in ,  and .Prince Philiprsquos last public visit is believed to be with the Queen, who was  years old at the time, to Musselburgh Racecourse in , when the couple helped it celebrate its th birthday.

the site where legend tells he was killed by a giant.Then, at Finnrsquos request, they walked to nearby Finlarig Castle.Izzy had always felt the castle had a sombre atmosphere, and so it did, even on this sun-drenched afternoon.Maybe itrsquos because it is quietly hidden away from the tourist trail, its unstable ruins concealed by old trees.Normally a tranquil place feels magical, but the grim deeds said to have been committed here darken the feelings.Izzy had already told Finn of the castle and he wanted to see the beheading pit and hanging tree.It was another built by the Campbell chief lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo at the beginning of the s ndash such a ruthless man, andaccounts of him were true, very cruel even for his time.At Finlarig, it is said, he enacted his lsquojusticersquo, in particular against the MacGregors, whose land he had taken and whom he hunted mercilessly.Finn stood in the pit where, according to tradition, noble victims were executed.Their Campbell persecutors could watch and gloat from a window above in the tower.Nearby was the hanging tree, where people of lesser status were said to have met their end.Finn found the overgrown steps that led to the summit of the small hill on which the tree grew.They stood on the spot where so many condemned men would have had their last view of this world.ldquoYoursquore right, aunty, this place does have a bit of a gothic atmosphere, especially when you know that so many people were hanged on the branches of this tree.Izzy nodded: ldquoBut remember, Finn, eventhis is the original hanging tree, then it is innocent, she said as they stood under its boughs.ldquoThe poor thing was used to commit terrible crimes, she put her hand on its trunk, ldquobut it wasnrsquot the treersquos fault.Finn wasnrsquot sureshe was joking itrsquos just a tree, how could it be blamed He put it down to his auntrsquos love of nature.She often spoke asplants and animals were like people.Finn looked around.ldquoCan you tell me a story about this place  he asked.Izzy thought for a moment, then agreed.They sat on a stone by an old holly tree in the sunshine and Izzy told two stories.First, the tale of a wedding at the castle interrupted by MacDonalds lting cattle.Then she told the tale of Marion Campbell, a daughter of a powerful Campbell chief.She had been promised to a man she didnrsquot love, but instead she eloped with Gregor Roy MacGregor, the chief of the MacGregors.ldquoThe sad thing is, explained Izzy, ldquothat beforehand the MacGregors and Campbells had been close allies for many generations, but then a feud over land and power developed.So Gregor Roy was forced into the hills as an outlaw, and Marion willingly joined him, marrying him against her fatherrsquos wishes.ldquoDespite their tough le, said Izzy, ldquothey deeply loved each other.Finn was fascinated as Izzy told Finn stories of their adventures of how they lived in the wilds, living in secret hideouts, hunted by the warriors of Marionrsquos father.She told the tale of how Gregor once escaped his pursuers by leaping over a river and how Marion gave birth to their first son in a cave.ldquoThey wrought vengeance on the Campbells, lting their cattle, said Izzy, ldquobut eventually they were found and Gregor was beheaded by a Campbell chief called Grey Colin in .ldquoIn the beheading pit  asked Finn.ldquoNo, not here, said Izzy, ldquobut at another castle at the east end of Loch Tay.\"Some accounts say poor Marion was forced to watch, and afterwards she composed a beautul lament, which is a sad song.\"She wrote it for her son, to explain to him what had happened to his father.Izzy recited a verse she could remember: ldquoEven in snow and blizzards, And days with all the seasons, Gregor would find a hollow for me, In which we would sleep cosily.ldquoWow, what a story. What happened to her after  asked Finn.Izzy shook her head: ldquoNobody knows, she disappears from history, but her son Alistair later avenged his fatherrsquos death and so the feuding continued, which explains the grim deeds at this castle.ldquoMaybe her son protected her after and hid her to keep her safe, wondered Finn.ldquoThatrsquos a nice thought, maybe.Finn stood up and walked around.ldquoIt would be betterfolks could just get on, donrsquot you think! he announced.ldquoAgreed! said Izzy.They walked back to the village.They had a much-needed wash with hot water and Finn called his mum.After a while, he poked his head out of the phone box: ldquoMum wants to talk to you.Izzy knew how dficult this time was for her sister, being separated from her son overnight for the first time in four years.But Izzy was trusted by her and Finnrsquos attachment to his aunt was very strong and made him feel safe.He was obviously missing his mother, but he seemed to be enjoying the journey and his moods had been better, so it was decided the journey could continue.ldquoRemember, mumrsquos back from Spain on Monday eve.ldquoI know, smiled Izzy, ldquowe will be there to meet her, I promise.After the call, they did some shopping and made a quick visit to the Folk Museum, which was housed in the old mill by the side of the river.Izzy wanted to show Finn St Fillanrsquos Stones, which were on display there ndash a tale to tell later when they went for a swim in his pool.As they walked back onto the bridge, Izzy had a surprise.She unlocked the gate which led to the old MacNab burial ground, where chiefs of the clan lie in a walled enclosure, their clan folk in the surrounding ground.ldquoItrsquos actually an island in the middle of the river, explained Izzy.ldquoIts name means yellow island. It was a prehistoric fort before it was a burial ground.Finn nodded as he walked round the edge, looking through the trees down at the river as it roared, then calmed its way to Loch Tay.Izzy spotted a carving of the MacNab crest, with an image of the head of a MacNeish chief, a reminder of a famous incident in the clanrsquos history.ldquoIrsquom getting hungry, aunty, said Finn.She had a plan for tea.They would eat within the ruins of Rob Royrsquos house at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart.It was a -minute drive west of Killin.They parked at a small layby just past the small bridge that took the busy traffic over the burn called Allt Coire Chaorach.ldquoThat there  asked Finn, pointing at the ruins.ldquoLooks like mostly a pile of stones with a chimney.ldquoItrsquos called Rob Royrsquos house, letrsquos have our tea there, said Izzy.ldquoReally, it was his house  How do we get to it It was a good question.Once they got over the gate, they followed a narrow bracken-covered path.They got scratched as they scrambled up a steep slope, but suddenly they were on the top and the ruined house was in front of them.They were only a short distance from the road, but it felt like a dferent world.Finn stood on a large stone that once formed part of the foundations and looked up at the one gable end that was still standing.No, it wasnrsquot just a pile of stones, he thought, he could see it had been a house.Finn scanned the landscape around him.Occasional traffic could be heard not far below, but the road seemed engulfed and made insignicant by the mountains and hills that dominated the view.A herd of highland cattle were grazing nearby.ldquoLook, look! We have our own Highland cows! Finn called to his aunt.ldquoPerfect, she said as she her puffed her way to the house.Finn jumped from the stone down to his aunt.ldquoSorry, let me help, he said.ldquoLetrsquos get set up said Izzy, laying the heavy rucksack down.Finn went for a closer look at the cattle while Izzy found a safe place to sit within the ruins.She got out the camping stove and began to cook.Finn joined her and they stared at the pasta as it twirled in the boiling water.The cows came to watch, standing in a row, tails twitching with a fascinated look on their faces.ldquoYoursquore right in what you said, aunty, remarked Finn between mouthfuls of pasta.Izzy curled her eyebrows not sure what he was referring to.ldquoFood tastes much better when itrsquos cooked outside, in a place like this, he explained with a big sauce-covered grin.The sun was now lowering in the sky and Izzy could feel the air finally cooling.The huge presence of Ben More was casting shadows in the glen.She took out her small fire dish, screwed on its legs and placed it carefully within the ruins, away from any vegetation.Finn suggested moving some stones to make more comfortable seats.ldquoWe are guests here, said Izzy, ldquowe are sitting amongst old ruins, and we must leave them exactly as we found them. Even our wee fire must leave no trace. There used to be a sign here telling people about this place, but people just didnrsquot respect it, theyrsquod damaged it or trash it, so the sign was taken away. We know better, so we are welcome guests.Finn nodded. He initially felt upbraided, but his aunt gave him a kind smile which changed the meaning of her words.Instead of feeling scolded, he felt a strange sense of privilege that hersquod been taught something important.ldquoThink how long this house has been here, said Izzy, who looked up at the gable end with the chimney.ldquoThat standing wall was added later, but it is said Rob built the original house here in . It was a time when he was a hunted outlaw. This was Campbell country when he lived here, but he was under the protection of a Campbell chief, how ironic was that  Robrsquos mother had been a Campbell, and yoursquove seen how MacGregors could be both enemies and family with Campbells.She pointed at the base of the ruins: ldquoThose stones are the foundations of the old walls. Now close your eyes for a moment, Finn. Imagine we are in the house in Robrsquos time. There are no windows, a thatched roof above us and a peat fire is in the middle, with a smoky heat filling the room. Now open your eyes, can you see the house as it used to be Finn opened his eyes and looked around.ldquoYes, I think so.ldquoCan you smell the peat smoke in your imagination ldquoI donrsquot know what it smells like aunty.ldquoItrsquos a sweet smoke.ldquoI smell it now.ldquoNow look up, can you see how the soot from the fire has made the rafters of the roof all black ldquoYeah, itrsquos all sooty.ldquoWe are sitting in the very place of the story, said Izzy. ldquoRight where you are, sat Rob Roy himself.ldquoNo aunty, hersquos next to me, otherwise hersquoll be on my knee, joked Finn.ldquoAll right then, of course, hersquos next to you, chuckled his aunt.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likely that you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"work-progressing-400-home-development-longniddry","story":"Work at the site ndash being marketed as lsquoLongniddry Villagersquo ndash has been ongoing for more than a year.The East Coast Main Line railway is all that separates the new development from the existing Longniddry settlement.But the site of the new homes is actually where lsquooldrsquo Longniddry once stood, hence its lsquoLongniddry Villagersquo name.This week, ZeroC, part of Places for People, opened the doors to its new show home in the development.Longniddry Village is being developed in partnership with landowners Wemyss and March Estates.Maps dating back to the s show that half of the old village of Longniddry was to the south of where the railway now runs, on the site of the present Longniddry Farm.When John Glassell acquired most of the lands of the village in , the pace of change increased and many of the remaining houses and buildings in the village were cleared for agriculture.The railway arrived in  and land previously owned by Mr Glassell was passed firstly to the House of Argyll and then to the Wemyss and March Estates, with the many new homes being built to the north of the railway line in the s.Allison Sutherland, regional sales and marketing director for Places for People in Scotland, said: ldquoItrsquos been an exciting time for Places for People to deliver our first ZeroC development in East Lothian, which delivers a fresh approach to building homes in the area.

Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament.

She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil.

David Cameron and his family are already rich beyond the imaginations of the overwhelming majority of voters in this country. Did he not feel just a little tawdry and humiliated as he went from minister to minister advisor to advisor, seeking favour for his billionaire clients  Perhaps his reported bonus of pound million carried him well past the point where self-esteem ceases to be a consideration.Was Health Secretary Matt Hancock so driven by a desire to wring every penny of financial leverage from his limited time in a great office of state that he didnrsquot consider his stake in a NHS-approved contractor to be immoral  Perhaps, having observed how ineffective Keir Starmerrsquos Labour opposition has been, they felt that the public were there for the taking without any consequences. After all their friends and colleagues who helped themselves to multi-million PPE contracts seem not to have encountered any backlash in the polls.Labour politicians in the Tony Blair era were slightly more circumspect in the process of capitalising on their time in office. Blair himself built a massive property portfolio while pimping himself out as a sort of international, travelling peace salesman. In office, Blair committed British troops to seven wars, all of which provided him with ample opportunity to make the connections in the Arab world that would provide a few extra zeroes in his pension. Since then his global consultancy providing peaceful solutions to stubborn conflicts has failed to reduce tension let alone avoid a war.

But now the privatising zeal of Margaret Thatcher has combined with Boris Johnsonrsquos contracts for cronies, to make this size issue more extreme.There are a lot more contracts knocking about and theyrsquove grown steadily larger, more complex and consequently lie even further beyond the reach of local firms.Big is automatically seen as a guarantor of success ndash even though banks that were \"too big\" did fail and small countries, with ultra-local government and a highly developed instinct for self-reliance have been held up as exemplars during the pandemic.EU procurement rules have been blamedfor carving local suppliers out, since contracts over a certain size had to be advertised across the whole European Union.

Theyrsquore like rubber balls ndash always rebounding.Largely thatrsquos because Holyrood and the House of Commons are like universities back in the good old days of the full grant. We pay politicians handsomely to go to parliament, where they learn all sorts of handy skills that prove very lucrative for le after office: how to navigate public contracts, deal with civil servants, avoid scrutiny, who to suck up to, which palms to grease and with what particular unction.When their careers end ndash in ignominy and failure as most iniably do ndash politicians know theyrsquore a strong commodity to peddle to the highest bidder. So eventheyrsquove seen the inside of a jail, therersquos always some shyster whorsquoll realise an ex-politician is a valuable asset for the payroll.Therein lies the formula for the lobbying industry and its relationship with former politicians: we pay politiciansrsquo salaries so they can skill up and flog their newfound talents to the highest bidder once theyrsquove left office, and their new paymasters can then rip off the taxpayer and exploit our democracy. A nice little earneryou can get it for all concerned ndash ordinary folk excluded obviously.You can tell that politics is a business in which politicians write the rules. Wersquore schmucks letting them get away with it. For proof of our collective schmuckhood, we once again, for the umpteenth time, find ourselves in the middle of a lobbying scandal: this time the Greensill affair.Itrsquos a vile swamp. Former Prime Minister David Cameron became an adviser for the finance firm Greensill after he left office. He was reportedly given share options worth tens of millions. Cameron contacted ministers, included chancellor Rishi Sunak, trying to get Greensill the largest possible allocation of government-backed loans under the Covid corporate financing facility. Cameron also took company boss Lex Greensill to private drinks with health secretary Matt Hancock. Lex Greensill previously had a role as lsquosenior advisorrsquo to Cameron when he was PM ndash a role in which Greensill was reportedly allowed to pitch financial projects across Whitehall.: Democracy in dangerThe scandal has thrown up all sorts of unpleasant truths, including the fact that civil servants are allowed to work for private industry while in office. Bill Crothers, former head of Whitehall procurement, became an adviser to Greensill while still employed by the civil service. John Manzoni, chief executive of the civil service, was allowed to keep a poundk a year job as a non-executive director of the company SABMiller.The stink isnrsquot confined to Westminster. Fergus Ewing, SNP rural economy secretary, had an unrecorded dinner with Lex Greensill, and steel billionaire Sanjeev Gupta. Wersquore told there were no officials with Ewing, no notes were taken. The government claims to have no emails, texts or phone records about happened. Deals struck between the SNP government, Gupta and Greensill exposed taxpayers to hundreds of millions of pounds of debt after Greensill collapsed. The ministerial code states that officials should be present for any discussions relating to government business, with facts recorded. Nicola Sturgeon claimsthat dinners which Fergus Ewing attended are ldquovery dferent from David Cameronrsquos antics and the SNP said that \"attempts to make mischief around this issue are utterly baseless.Inevitably, therersquos going to be a Greensill inquiry ndash there always is when one of these scandals erupts. But donrsquot expect anything to change. It never does. After all,wersquod learned anything from previous scandals, Greensill wouldnrsquot have happened. Nigel Boardman, appointed by Boris Johnson to run the inquiry, is on the board of a private bank with close ties to the Tory party and a number of former civil servants in its ranks.We can, however, nip all this in the bud immediately, and end the scandal of political lobbying once and for all. The one simple way to stop this gross exploitation of the public is to ban anyone whorsquos ever held political office from lobbying on behalf of business interests for le. Soyoursquove served one single day as an elected representative, yoursquore barred from lobbying your former colleagues on behalf of any corporate interest. No more Sir Nick Clegg working as Facebookrsquos lobbyist, for instance. We could go as far as banning politicians from all lobbying, but some has decent intent. It would be draconian to prevent lobbying for a charity, for instance ndash as long as that lobbying is done openly and without profit.: Where is the vision Therersquos some other changes we also need to clean up public le. The definition of what lobbying is needs to be claried in Scotland to ensure that all forms of communication are covered, and that politicians canrsquot wriggle out of scrutiny by playing semantics around what a lsquomeetingrsquo actually means. At the moment thatrsquos not clear, and lobbyists have been exploiting loopholes which require only lsquovisual interactionsrsquo to be registered. Phone calls and emails donrsquot have to be registered. Lobbying rules should also extend to civil servants ndash theyrsquore not covered by the register.So is change likely  The omens donrsquot look good. The SNP has a host of former big wigs working as lobbyists so I wouldnrsquot set any store in the party suddenly finding its moral conscience. The Tories basically invented the revolving door between lobbying and public le. When it comes to Labour, the MSP who led the charge in Holyrood against lobbying scandals, Neil Findlay, appeared to court companies to hire him as a lobbyist in advance of him standing down at this election.However, change is down to us. If we donrsquot order the politicians ndash whose salaries we pay ndash to legislate for the public standards we expect, then wersquoll have nobody to blame but ourselves when the next Greensill scandal inevitably happens.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

There are also plans for a womenrsquos version.Doesnrsquot sound like much of a shake up ...So itrsquos all about money Bingo.

Founding clubs will receive a payment of pound billion ldquosolely to support their infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the COVID pandemic. For hundreds of football clubs who can only dream of European football and who have been driven to the brink of extinction by the pandemic it all makes unpleasant reading. Needless to say football governing bodies UEFA and FIFA arenrsquot happy either.What are the fans saying A statement about the Super League from Football Supporters Europe doesnrsquot mince its words: ldquoIt is driven exclusively by greed. The only ones who stand to gain are hedge funds, oligarchs, and a handful of already wealthy clubs, many of which perform poorly in their own domestic leagues despite their in-built advantage.

Its phenomenal success ndash . million tuned in for the opening episode of this series, not to mention the many whorsquoll watch again on iPlayer just to get to grips with some of those inpenetrabilities ndash reflects this.In an age when Black actors have sometimes been cast simply to tick a box or to mention in a producerrsquos annual appraisal, the scene between actors Martin Compston, Shalom Brune-Franklin and Adrian Dunbar in which it was revealed that institutional racism had played a part in a case they were examining, was trail blazing.They discussed a case where a young Black architect, Lawrence Christopher, had been attacked by a gang of white youths with a history of racial violence and taken into custody where he was mocked by police officers as he died from his injuries.The character Steve Arnott, played by Compston, turned to his Black colleague and said he was sorry she had ldquoto dredge all that up and askedshe was okay.She replied with a barely perceptible hint of pain in her voice: ldquoCustody officers were laughing and making monkey noises while Christopher lay dying. They were all cleared of misconduct, took early retirement for stresshellipand claimed tens of thousands of pounds in compensationhellip How could anyone be okay I choked on the power of this scene. DC Chloe Bishop for five episodes has played the almost emotionless foil for some of Steve Arnottrsquos hypothesesand suddenly out of nowhere we are reminded of her humanness and her blackness and her experience and her strength at having to deal with this case.At last here was a recognition that Black characters could be written to reflect the universal themes and stories that affect us all but that they also have experiences that only they can uniquely reflect or react to. Add to this the fact that Mercurio has based the storyline on the real le events around the murder of Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths in , and the death in police custody of Falklands veteran Christopher Alder in , and itrsquos clear that authenticity is at the heart of this episode.And authenticity is one of the great aims of ersity. Yes, ersity is also about fairness, representation, and inclusivity but for audiences and TV executives alike ersity brings new stories and crucially, dferent ways of telling stories.As someone who has worked in television for  years and counting, and been through countless  dawns where it felt like progress on representation was being made after a series of short-term initiatives only to be told an idea was ldquotoo niche or there ldquowasnrsquot enough Black or Asian talent out there, I am convinced that we have now crossed some sort of Rubicon.After last yearrsquos Black Lives Matter protests, UK broadcasters were swt to act. ITV launched an advertising campaign in support of the dance act Diversityrsquos Black Lives Matter-themed performance on Britainrsquos Got Talent. The performance had received , complaints to Ofcom for being ldquotoo political. ITVrsquos full-page ads in every newspaper featured a still from the performance which read: ldquoWe are changed by what we see. Just as we are changed when we are seen. Ofcom rejected the complaints.The BBC has earmarked pound million of its existing budget towards inclusive and erse content over the next three years. The money is available to those creating erse content, erse production leadership and erse-lead production companies. The definition of erse is Black or minority ethnic, disabled and those from lower-income backgrounds. The BBC is also asking all producers they work with to ensure % of their workforce are from under-represented groups.This is a mammoth but top-down effort that will bring rewards for all ndash for the audience with their ever increasing appetite for content, for the TV industry as a whole, but most of all I think, for those in under-represented groups who never imagined a career in film or TV was for them ndash the door is open.When I think of under-represented groups I think of the many schools I visited as a BBC education producer in the s all over Scotland but particularly in places like Castlemilk and Govanhill where few young people would have thought about a career working in film or television because it didnrsquot feel like the kind of environment for them.

Id rather watch the dads playing park football ndash theres a lot more goals for a start. So I was supremely indferent to the news that some English clubs with more money than sense had decided to join a breakaway European Super League. Better off without them.However, the mega-stushie in the beautul game has now taken on an unexpected political signicance. The future king has joined with the Prime Minister to condemn this European League of Greed. Boris Johnson has promised to blitz the ESL with ldquoa legislative bomb.Im not entirely sure the government can prevent these foreign-owned private businesses crossing continents, but never mind.

MACWHIRTER:Alba needs a U-turn after its car crash campaignThe European Super League has nothing whatever to do with the European Union, but it does with something underlying it: globalisation. It is part of the relentless march of capitalist expansion across national borders, leaving the little people behind. And there has been a hint of Brexit in the way commentators have condemned the mega clubs for betraying their country and community. Pundits on the left have been sounding like Nigel Farage wondering whatever happened to patriotism and loyalty to ones own.It is all about money, of course. The founding clubs will reportedly share pound billion courtesy of JP Morgan, which is one of the mega banks now financing Big Footie. This is to help them adjust to the rarefied atmosphere of global football, and is absolutely not intended as a bribe, or to buy the lads a drink. It is also to cover their vast debts.Fans and football governing bodies like UEFA are furious. The left-behind clubs stand to lose a heap of money by not being included in this European Super League. Politicians and football celebrities like Gary Lineker are attacking the breakaway clubs for disrespecting the fans and for polluting the Peoples Game with filthy lucre.There is, it has to be said, just a hint of hypocrisy in this outrage from wealthy ex-players and managers. British football is hardly a model of affordable community sport. The Premier league is all about money ndash mainly TV cash ndash which has been used to pay ludicrous sums to the primping prima donnas of the pitch. The main reason the sports personalities and clubs are worried now is that some of their money will be creamed off by the super leaguers.Defenders of the ESL say its just the way the game is going in the age of globalisation. They claim that many of the big clubs, far from minting it, are actually dicing with bankruptcy. This is partly because of Covid, but mainly because of the huge debts they have incurred trying to maintain their standing in the world and keep their fans happy. To survive, the top clubs need to cash in on that global status. Playing a wet Wednesday in Stoke doesnt make it.READMORE MACWHIRTER:Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe fans arent entirely innocent bystanders here. Theyve wanted success above all ndash silverware in the boardroom. To quote Bill Shankly: ldquoIf you are first youre firstyoure second youre nothing. To win nowadays is hugely expensive. Superstar Lionel Messis contract with FC Barcelona is worth over poundm a year. This may help explain why the world-famous club is in pound.bn in debt.Of course, theres a simple answer to that cash flow problem: just dont pay them. But that doesnt work in the global sports marketplace, apparently. From the point of view of clubs like Manchester United, who apparently have more fans in India than in England, it is all about giving their viewers what they want. It is no more objectionable, they say, than rock bands performing in mega stadiums on world tours. No one says the Rolling Stones are abandoning their fans and following the money.If people keep paying, the Super League will probably happen, sooner or later, whatever the politicians say. As for Scottish football ndash well, nothing to see here since no team in Scotland is remotely in contention. Which in many ways is a very good thing. Every few years there are rumours about Rangers and Celtic plotting to join the English Premier league on the grounds that they cant afford to continue in the small pond of Scottish football. But it never seems to happen.This could be an opportunity for Scottish football to go precisely the other way: become a sport which was more about local fellowship than global finance. Be more like the Jags. Partick Thistle is one of a small but growing number of Scottish clubs that are owned by their supporters. Mind you that was because of the generosity of the late Colin Weir, who essentially bought the club to give it to the fans. I doubtthe American Glazer family, who own Man U, will do likewise.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

We have the drive, the knowledge, the skills and also the ambition.One area where we could improve, however, is education. Specically, our young people need to become enthused by, and engaged with, the ious opportunities technology offers.If they see exciting and worthwhile careers are available in tech and go on to fulfil these roles, it will build the critical talent pool required.Digital Xtra Fund is targeting exactly this goal. A Scotland-wide charity, it is increasing interest in computing and technology among those aged  and under by supporting extracurricular tech activities that inspire young people to follow this path.The Fund has been highly successful and continues to grow. It is winning new financial support and expanding its ambitions further to the point where it is now seriously contemplating a future where there is a tech club in every school or community in the country. ldquoWe have new partnerships in place and a new role within the Fund, says Kraig Brown, the Fundrsquos Partnerships and Development Manager. ldquoItrsquos all very positive.In a major boost, the Fund has most recently partnered with new Scottish tech investment company Chroma Ventures, which has donated pound,. This means when the Fundrsquos annual grants are announced in June, it will award pound, rather than the pound, originally announced.The charity is also hiring a Community and Grants Officer to help take it to the next level. This person will focus on fostering collaboration between industry and grant recipients.They will also help those receiving financial awards to understand concepts such as ethics in technology, how to use tech as a force for good, as well as the importance of meta-skills ndash skills to create, collaborate and empathise with others ndash alongside technical skills. Kraig Brown says the new role is part of a wider strategy to help industry enthuse youngsters about tech and develop their understanding of the digital world.ldquoWe want to get more professionals in front of young people talking about their careers. If young people can connect what theyrsquore learning to these jobs, it will help exponentially long-term.One example he gives occurred during a recent online session he attended at Heart of Midlothian FCrsquos Innovation Centre, a community-based initiative offering courses to help participants learn digital skills.ldquoThere was a User Experience Designer from Sky who was giving participants some really useful feedback on things like how their apprsquos buttons could stand out better and where the back button should be to make it more intuitive.ldquoI think these types of interactions are hugely valuable because it relates the learning to lsquoreal lersquo while also informing young people what a UX Designer does.This doesnrsquot happen enough, but this new role will encourage and facilitate more of these interactions and share examples of best practice.Kraig is also delighted with the additional funding provided by Chroma Ventures.ldquoIt made an immediate impact. It means we can now disburse pound, this year ndash thatrsquos fantastic. It also puts us back on track with where we were pre-Covid Irsquom proud of that too.This increased confidence is enabling the Fund to think more about how Scotland can become a global tech leader. Kraig would like Digital Xtra Fund to lead on developing a network of lsquoTechspacesrsquo for every school or community across the country. Modelled after Makerspaces ndash these would be informal learning spaces designed and dedicated to giving young people the opportunity to get creativewith tech.ldquoThey would be fun, safe spaces where children and young people could get hands-on and learn about tech. They could discover and explore at their own pace while trying out ious coding s or kit. The learning is informal, but educators and volunteers would provide lessons and structure just like all the other extracurricular activities we support. However, there isnrsquot the stress of a test or essay at the end which puts a lot of young people off trying computing when they get to Secondary.ldquoTechspaces would also operate outwith the curriculum meaning they would be flexible and could more easily involve industry volunteers. Non-curriculum programmes such as lsquodo your:bitrsquo from the Micro:bit Educational Foundation, iDEA Badges, or Apps for Good ndash which are proven to engage young people ndash could be easily incorporated as therersquod be no set curriculum. This would give participants opportunities to try new things and essentially play around without a fear of failure.This approach addresses several of the challenges facing Computer Science in schools. ldquoFirst and foremost, there arenrsquot enough Computer Science teachers in Secondary Schools and the ones who are in place have to keep an eye on the curriculum.ldquoAt the Primary level, teachers are already often at capacity so asking them to include more during class time isnrsquot always viable, not to mention the training involved. Evenwe overcame this, many schools donrsquot have the kit or budget and eventhey do, it is often restricted by firewalls set by the Council.ldquoWe need make the idea of playing with technology exciting and not stressful. This could be done in the classroom ndash there are some brilliant examples of this across Scotland ndash but there are many challenges doing it that way and we need to start winning young people over more quickly.Kraig is under no illusions the magnitude of this vision. With , schools in Scotland, it would require signicant investment. However, he does not believe this all should come from the Government either.ldquoDigital Xtra Fund has successfully brought industry and Government together to award pound, over the past five years. Yes, education is ultimately the responsibility of the Government, but it is industry that needs this to happen and will directly benefit from an increased talent pool. As such, we need to work together. I believe this is the easiest and quickest way to create a generation of inventors and innovators to make Scotland a global leader in the digital economy.www.digitalxtrafund.scot--------------------------------------Scots entrepreneurs share fundrsquos aim to inspire youngstersTHERE is no doubt that the Digital Xtra Fundrsquos vision of digital learning is a highly challenging and ambitious one. But Kraig Brown believes in thinking big. His mantra is thatthere is a will, there is a way.Bringing Chroma Ventures on board is undoubtedly a big step forward. The company was established in Scotland earlier this year by entrepreneurs Paddy Burns and Chris van der Kuyl.Pictured left, Paddy Burns, Chris van der Kuyl and Gavin Anderson of tech investment firm Chroma VenturesIt is the investment arm of J Studios, the multiple award winning video games company best known for developing Minecraft for Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo games consoles.It shares the fundrsquos ethos that inspiring young people to understand and to create with technology is essential to the future well-being of Scotland.The donation is one of the biggest the charity has received to this date.As part of the companyrsquos new commitment to the fund its Principal Paddy Burns, who is also Chief Executive of J Studios, will now join as a trustee, bringing new thinking and strengthening the charityrsquos entrepreneurial credentials.Kraig Brown says that he is delighted about the tie-up. ldquoLike many charities,  was full of uncertainty for us.ldquoThis support from Chroma Ventures has enabled us to continue supporting educators and young people at the same level as previous years. At a time when many in the third sector are struggling, this is important as it builds confidence among our grant recipients, stakeholders and other industry partners that we will consistently support talent in Scotlandrsquos tech sector.And Paddy Burns comments: ldquoTechnology is a thread that runs through my own back story and the sort of initiatives delivered by Digital Xtra Fund resonated strongly.

Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/salmon_farmJPG-1.jpg","title":"region should be more than a playground for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhat is also very clear is that the impacts of the pandemic are extremely unequal, with the young having their prospects most severely impaired and those working in the private sector suffering the most severe economic consequences, yet to be felt in full, while the elderly and those with underlying health issues bearing the most risk to le, which has been tragic.Many people working in the front line have worked heroically. Of course, this includes those in the health service who have had to battle to save lives, but it also includes those who kept the boilers running, the ambulances and delivery vehicles on the road and the PPE arriving where required. That includes those in supply chains up and down the country, drivers, engineers, and tradesmen keeping our homes and critical facilities operational. It also includes those who have produced our food and those who distributed it and indeed those who kept the wheels and machinery of production and distribution of le’s essentials turning. Not least in the supply chain required to put food on our plates.A great many of our population, however — which is a blessing for them, whether wealthy, retired or working in the public sector or government, local or national — have neither had their economic situation nor their future employment prospects impaired, though of course, everyone has suffered the social deprivations and mental health challenges of lockdown. For those fortunate enough to be working in secure public sector employment or retired, perhaps on a secure pension, they do not have the financial concerns of those in the private sector whose jobs and livelihoods depend on viable economic activity.This imbalance of the bearing of the economic consequences of the pandemic is not given coverage or widely recognised, though our politicians at a national and local level are actively involved in formulating policy, actions, and funding programmes to sustain the economy and build back greener, better, and more fairly.Never has it been more critical for government at all levels, locally and nationally, to do everything possible to create and support sustainable jobs across our nation.We all have an obligation to recognise and understand this fundamental fact and do what we can to support economic growth and sustain people in, as well as create new jobs. The lack of a job, and the want of it, is fundamentally one of the most damaging situations to the long-term prospects, an inidual, their family and therefore society at large can suffer from.Economic growth and development,we are to sustain ourselves as a society, must be front and centre of government policy and action at national and local level. Local authorities and local politicians have a duty and an obligation too, not only to support development but make sure that they actively seek out and promote economic development opportunities within their areas of responsibility as a minimum. There needs to be some maturity in decision making and joined-up thinking in policy and action. You simply cannot have development without some impact, but neither can you have social progression without economic development.How can we call for building back our economy and protecting jobs, yet fail to support compliant job-creating planning applications  For example, the recent decision to refuse planning for an organic sea farm in Skye, which was recommended for approval, was in my view a dereliction of responsibility. It was to create nine new jobs directly. However, just the cancelling of the equipment orders required by this development and to be built here in the Highlands by our company, Gael Force Group, has caused the redundancy of over  people immediately and directly, just in this one company alone. This is a shocking narrowness in consideration and a failure of process and joined up thinking.We have become anti-development, anti-business in this country, yet we want all the benefits that depend on a strong, successful, and growing economy. It seems that we are prepared in this country now to tolerate someone dying from hunger and homelessness and the lack of a job, but not prepared to tolerate ‘our’ view or environment being altered. In the view of some people, all other forms of nature now have precedence over their fellow human beings. Like the clearances, once again the welfare of the local people who work the land and the sea is being considered as secondary to the narrow interests of a minority, often not rooted in the area, who care not for the economic wellbeing of other local people. We need to put people, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing first.The depressing familiarity of narrow interest groups’ objections to developments, often by an outspoken, sometimes fanatical, minority, often prejudiced on misinformation fuelled on social media but not supported by the scientic facts, is reaching a crisis across the Highlands and Islands and needs to be addressed. It requires local and national political leadership to speak out and stand up for the greater good, for the peoples of the Highlands and Islands welfare and livelihoods and retake the economic development agenda that has made the rural Highlands and Islands such a turnaround success over the past  to  years.If we do not see a change of behaviour in the support of development and growing the economy by all of us, we will be a failing nation, with rural areas becoming very largely inactive economically a playground for tourists, who are very welcome but who come and who go. A place again, where the will of the few suppress the opportunity of the many. If we do not change direction, we will leave no fine place, which in rural Scotland it should be, to raise a young family as our legacy.

He thought the landscape idea would be fitting.“We were thinking of locations and the Storr is quite an obvious one. We actually had an image of that particular view and thought that it would work really well.“It took a good few months to arrange because the wall belongs to Boots, so it took a bit of time to get the go ahead but we have got there.”He added: “From an arts point of view it is great to do something like this because it engages local interest as well as being for visitors.“It was very much just a way of brighting up the lane that we’re on anda by-product of it is that it benefits the other businesses here then great.”Like most business owners, Niall has experienced his fair share of obstacles due to the uncertainty brought by the pandemic. However, with Birch set to reopen at the end of April, he is excited about welcoming back customers with the cafe set to embark on a new venture.He said: “We are reopening at the end of the month and starting our own coffee roastery. We#ll start it on a small scale to begin with – by supplying Birch and a few other establishments on the island, and then a couple of months down the line I’ll open it up to online sales.“I have a passion for coffee and it is so much more exciting to be part of the whole process – from sourcing, importing, and now roasting, to then serving the final product.“It creates a much better story, and it is also an ethical way of doing it as we have direct links with the farmers that we are getting the coffee from.”Assessing the season ahead, he added: “It’s a mixed bag of feelings, it is dficult to have complete faith that this is the final lockdown – I think everybody needs to err on the side of caution and respect the rules that are in place.“The added benefit of Skye is that it is rural so there is lots of space for people to socially distance. And, thankfully, with the exception of Home Farm there hasn’t been any major outbreaks – and I think that was because people were being safe and able to be outdoors.“As long as people are following the rules then that’s the best we can do.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1618924795281.jpg--covid_19___tue_20th_apr_figures.jpg?1618924795000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210420newscovid 19 tue 20th apr figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows One further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.

Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Tourism is worth roughly €mto the Bundoran economy annually, welcoming hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.Sinn Fein councillor Michael McMahon, a former mayor of the town, said visitors are always welcome to the town.It#s not our intention to turn people away from Bundoran, he said.We depend very much on Northern Irish tourism because we#re in very close proximity to the border.They have been the bread and butter in Bundoran for decades. Mr McMahon said the roll-out of the vaccine will allow the town to safely welcome holidaymakers in the coming months.The vast majority of the people in the six counties are vaccinated so they are no threat.If they#re doing the right things - keeping two metres apart and keeping a safe distance - then I don#t see any harm in that.Mr McMahon said that with the absence of international travel, the town will be more dependent on visitors doing staycations again this summer.I want to see tourists coming to Bundoran and I want to see people getting back to some sort of a normality.I want to see restaurants, arcades and hotels opening, he added.Local tourists descended on the town in record numbers last summer when restrictions were lted, with many choosing Bundoran as their staycation destination, giving a massive boost to the local economy.Tourism officer for Bundoran Shane Smyth said the pandemic has caused an increase in visitors to the town.We have always had a big historic connection to Bundoran with people from the North, he said.They were the backbone of the visitor population to the town for decades and centuries.It was only last year then that we started to get more people from the southern counties that were traveling to Donegal for the first time and that was great to see, he said.Belfast Most ReadNew IRA blamed for bomb attempt on female part-time PSNI officer and her young daughterNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedGang of youths attack north Belfast home in hate crimeRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isFurniture set alight in Belfast disorder and loyalists protest protocol in ArdsTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyLatest Northern IrelandTyrone man charged over video of child driving lorry on motorway bailedWork to begin on first-of-its-kind shared education campus in LimavadyTime limit on Troubles prosecutions should apply to all – Veterans CommissionerDublin man in court in Northern Ireland over attempted murder of policemanLeo Docherty replaces Johnny Mercer at Ministry of DefenceLatestArmagh teacher charged with threatening to kill principal and her family facing trialBallycastle Hotel’s plan for new restaurant could create  jobsFianna Fail members stage ‘intervention’ over housing BillIndependence talks, free school meals and climate action high on Alba’s agendaTaoiseach insists goal of vaccinating % of adults by June still stands,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

ReutersChristopher LeebodyTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Prime Minister has told the House of Commons there is “more to be done” for veterans of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, following the resignation of defence minister Johnny Mercer.The Prime Minister was responding to DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who called on Mr Johnson to “stand by” his commitment to introduce legislation protecting veterans of the Troubles from “vexatious prosecutions”.Read MoreJohnny Mercer claims he had ‘no choice’ but to quit as veterans ministerDowning Street confirmed on Tuesday evening that the Prime Minister had accepted Mr Mercer’s resignation as veterans minister following speculation he intended to quit the post.MP Johnny Mercer had been heavily involved in the Overseas Operations Bill, which is going through its final stages in Parliament.The legislation was developed in response to legal claims made after operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it does not cover incidents in Northern Ireland. Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Read MoreLeo Docherty replaces Johnny Mercer at Ministry of DefenceIn his letter to Mr Johnson, Mr Mercer said that not including those who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles was his “red line” and that veterans of the conflict “deserve the protections of the Overseas Operations Bill”.Speaking in Westminster on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: “I want to put on record, by the way, my thanks to the former minister for veterans for all that he did to help with improving the lot of veterans across our country.There is more to be done, asrightly says, in the case of veterans of the Northern Ireland conflict and we will be bringing forward further measures in due course.”It comes as the First Minister Arlene Foster has said there is “no equivalence” between former soldiers and paramilitaries when it comes to Troubles-related prosecutions.The DUP leader also described being “sorry” that the former Westminster defence minister Johnny Mercer resigned.Mrs Foster said the Overseas OperationsBill - which is designed to protect veterans from unfounded prosecutions by imposing a time limit on prosecutions - is a bill she would support.The DUP leader added that veterans should not face investigations decades after the Troubles. However, she added that those who had “stepped outside” the law while operating in the army should be “held to account”.Northern Ireland’s veterans’ commissioner Danny Kinahan suggested on Wednesday that such a limit on any prosecutions should apply to civilians alongside soldiers.I don’t want to see any veterans going to court that don’t have to...there are cases that must go [to court] from all sides, he told BBC Radio Ulster’s Good Morning Ulster.I don#t support anything that stops someone who should be going to court going to court but we do need to put some limit here.I think it has to be for everyone... what we need is for everyone to engage and actually help find the solution.“We have cases here bubbling from people who served ,  sometimes close to -years-ago – we are not likely to get any prosecutions from it.”Disagreeing with the former Ulster Unionist MP on whether a time limit on prosecutions should apply to “everyone”, Arlene Foster said the “hope of justice can’t be taken away” from victims.“There is always an attempt to bring some equivalence between people who put on the armour of protecting their citizens and those people who go out to murder and maim,” she added.“There is no equivalence between terrorists who go out to murder and maim and those veterans and people who go out to serve their country and protect.”Belfast Most ReadNew IRA blamed for bomb attempt on female part-time PSNI officer and her young daughterNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedGang of youths attack north Belfast home in hate crimeRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isChristian Jessen denies receiving documents in Arlene Foster libel caseTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyLatest Northern IrelandTyrone man charged over video of child driving lorry on motorway bailedWork to begin on first-of-its-kind shared education campus in LimavadyTime limit on Troubles prosecutions should apply to all – Veterans CommissionerDublin man in court in Northern Ireland over attempted murder of policemanLeo Docherty replaces Johnny Mercer at Ministry of DefenceLatestArmagh teacher charged with threatening to kill principal and her family facing trialBallycastle Hotel’s plan for new restaurant could create  jobsEx-prisoner urged police to ‘just shoot’ Fishmongers’ Hall attackerFishmongers’ Hall hero ‘didn’t want Khan to get satisfaction of being killed’Fianna Fail members stage ‘intervention’ over housing Bill,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It had been so long,” said Sarah whose alarm clock goes off at an ungodly .am.“It’s absolutely brilliant to finally be in Belfast.“I had a few anxiety dreams where I missed everything and was running around in a building unable to find a door with a microphone on the other side of it... then I woke up three minutes before the alarm went off.“I was fully organised. The younger me would’ve been very impressed. I’d all my clothes laid out. I had a shower the night before... I was all ready to go.” Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Sarahfronts GMU from Monday to Thursday – Mondays with Joel and the other three days with Chris Buckler , the BBC’s former Washington Correspondent, at Ormeau Avenue’s Broadcasting House.Having initially relocated from the Peak District to Donegal with husband Terry Coyleand their six-year-old son Theo, they recently moved into a new home in Eglinton on the outskirts of Derry.“I had a bit of dficulty getting onto the A on the first day because every road was closed so there was a good bit of stress to start the day but thankfully I arrived at exactly the same time as Joel,” she said.“I pulled up behind him in the car park and then I instantly felt at ease and happy because he’s such good craic.”With a global pandemic causing massive disruption to #normal# working practices, Tuesday was actually the first time Sarah and Chris had physically seen each other since being interviewed for the jobs in December .“We started on air at the end of April last year so it has taken exactly a year for us to be in the same room as each other,” she said.“I was genuinely happy to see him. After all of this time... to finally get to be together, it was special.“Around the time of the interviews, we talked about how much we were looking forward to working together... and then we ended up spending a year not seeing each other apart from on Zoom.”Not that close proximity always means perfection.“Hilariously, we almost didn’t know who was going to pick up right at the start of this morning’s programme at .am,” Sarah revealed.“But it’s much easier now because you can read someone physically when you’re next to them.“Within two or three weeks, Chris and I will know by the way the other person sits in a chair whether or not they want to get in, whether or not they want to make a cup of tea...“We’ve already learned each other’s way of broadcasting incredibly well – maybe even better - because it’s like we’ve developed an extra sense to a certain extent through not being together.”During the show, her co-presenter exposed Sarah’s early morning Jaffa Cake fix and she told me the treat “does not y, because not all biscuits are created equal at the breakfast time of day”.“If I’m broadcasting, then the Jaffa Cakes are my breakfast because I won’t have eaten at am,” she said, adding that she’s in bed by pm on work nights.Currently Sarah’s commute is “ miles door to door, which takes about one hour  minutes” although once the roadworks are complete she’ll be able to shave some time off that.“I’ve got a six-year-old and an -year-old mother, who’s living with me, and a husband I’m leaving... let’s see how this new arrangement goes,” she said.Co-presenter Chris meanwhile, was shocked when Sarah suddenly exited the studio during one of Tuesday morning’s news bulletins.“I think he thought I was leaving him at am when I got up and left, but I was actually just going to make us a cup of tea,” she said.“During the programme I need to walk and clear my head because otherwise you’re sitting there for two and a half hours.“Chris, on the other hand, was sitting drinking the same cup of tea for two and a half hours, which is utterly outrageous.”Belfast Most ReadNew IRA blamed for bomb attempt on female part-time PSNI officer and her young daughterNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedGang of youths attack north Belfast home in hate crimeRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isFurniture set alight in Belfast disorder and loyalists protest protocol in ArdsTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyLatest Northern IrelandTyrone man charged over video of child driving lorry on motorway bailedWork to begin on first-of-its-kind shared education campus in LimavadyTime limit on Troubles prosecutions should apply to all – Veterans CommissionerDublin man in court in Northern Ireland over attempted murder of policemanLeo Docherty replaces Johnny Mercer at Ministry of DefenceLatestArmagh teacher charged with threatening to kill principal and her family facing trialBallycastle Hotel’s plan for new restaurant could create  jobsFishmongers’ Hall hero ‘didn’t want Khan to get satisfaction of being killed’Fianna Fail members stage ‘intervention’ over housing BillIndependence talks, free school meals and climate action high on Alba’s agenda,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, we of course must go further.“We must deal with these people through the justice system. They must be brought before the court and dealt with in the appropriate way.”Meanwhile, the First Minister also dismissed suggestions there could be an imminent vote for Irish unity, following a BBC Spotlight opinion poll reporting that % of people here thought Northern Ireland would no longer be part of the UK in -years# time.“This whole thing that a united Ireland is just around the corner, I have heard that all my adult le,” she said.“This is a feature of narrow nationalism, that they use this sort of inevitability argument that we are going to move towards a united Ireland.“That really frustrates me - that over this past while we have spent so much time and I have listened to so much debate over a united Ireland...but yet there is no balanced debate of where we are in a global United Kingdom moving forward.”Belfast Most ReadNew IRA blamed for bomb attempt on female part-time PSNI officer and her young daughterNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedGang of youths attack north Belfast home in hate crimeRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isFurniture set alight in Belfast disorder and loyalists protest protocol in ArdsTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyLatest Northern IrelandTyrone man charged over video of child driving lorry on motorway bailedWork to begin on first-of-its-kind shared education campus in LimavadyTime limit on Troubles prosecutions should apply to all – Veterans CommissionerDublin man in court in Northern Ireland over attempted murder of policemanLeo Docherty replaces Johnny Mercer at Ministry of DefenceLatestArmagh teacher charged with threatening to kill principal and her family facing trialBallycastle Hotel’s plan for new restaurant could create  jobsFishmongers’ Hall hero ‘didn’t want Khan to get satisfaction of being killed’Fianna Fail members stage ‘intervention’ over housing BillIndependence talks, free school meals and climate action high on Alba’s agenda,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Also getting £m-plus are Bangor Academy and Sixth Form College, and St Paul#s High in Bessbrook.At the other end of the scale, rural primaries like Duneane PS in Toomebridge must make do with £,.What it adds up to is not enough cake to go around - a situation school leaders have become all too used to.Yes, this can be dressed up as a small uplt in funding, said Dr Graham Gault, president of the National Head Teachers# Association.That can be welcomed, but it is many millions of pounds short of what is needed.Huge though the sum may seem, this is not the all-singing, all-dancing budget to allow schools to perform to the best of their ability.Dr Gault says there are three simple but key dimensions in assessing the available funding.Firstly, a decade of withdrawing hundreds of millions of pounds from front line education has created huge deficit positions for many schools, which just get larger with each financial year, he added.Secondly, aside from cumulative deficits from which most schools can never escape, the annual budgets allocated to schools are, in most cases, not enough to meet the basic spending needs of keeping a school open.And thirdly, of schools# current spending, between % and % is allocated to basic staffing provision alone.It doesn#t take much working out to imagine what is left for the resourcing of children#s learning and development after the essential costs are met like heat, electricity... the list goes.What it means is that a sticking plaster has once again been administered to a system in need of major surgery.The truth is, of course, our children and young people have endured greater cuts than in any other jurisdiction on these islands, said Dr Gault. Sticking plaster attempts to help will not be sufficient for the depth, seriousness and potentially long-term signicance of these wounds.We need urgent, serious action in the form of money to our front line education services.Where, though, is that money going to come from On top of all that, analysis released by the Education Policy Instituteshows some £-£bn is required across the UK to make up for learning lost during the pandemic.Some £m is needed in Northern Ireland alone, and while teachers will recoil at the terminology, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said establishing a long-term plan for catch-up was the biggest priority.EPI research shows without ambitious funding and interventions, which tackle the scale of lost education, there are likely to be severe long-run consequences for young people#s schooling, earnings and le chances, which would in turn cause damage to the economy.There may be a little hope on the horizon, with a full independent review of the education system due this year. The process for compiling the  is under way, but whoever sits on it won#t have to look far to see the needless millions being spent on an antiquated system no longer fit for purpose. The administrative costs of maintaining such a erse system continues to eat education from within.Courage is needed to make the dficult choices and begin peeling the layers away one by one. Like an onion, with every layer peeled, some will cry. Tears, though, shed for the greater good of children. Tears can be wiped away and eyes can be dried, but there is only one chance at giving a child the right education.Assessing the maths homework, extra revision is required or parents will again be footing the bill for toilet rolls.Belfast Most ReadNew IRA blamed for bomb attempt on female part-time PSNI officer and her young daughterNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedGang of youths attack north Belfast home in hate crimeRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isChristian Jessen denies receiving documents in Arlene Foster libel caseTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyLatest Northern IrelandChecks proposed for Irish land border will not solve sea border issues, MPs toldDUP minister attends north-south meeting after two no-showsTyrone man charged over video of child driving lorry on motorway bailedWork to begin on first-of-its-kind shared education campus in LimavadyTime limit on Troubles prosecutions should apply to all – Veterans CommissionerLatestArmagh teacher charged with threatening to kill principal and her family facing trialBallycastle Hotel’s plan for new restaurant could create  jobsChecks proposed for Irish land border will not solve sea border issues, MPs told‘Big Six’ could yet face Premier League punishment over Super League plansDUP minister attends north-south meeting after two no-shows,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      The virtual event has attracted a larger number that might normally have gathered in the ICC in Belfast, the organisers said.This is about future business, working with these tour operators on future years, said Mr McGrillen, adding that the buyers are being brought up to the speed on existing and new attractions.One of the most signicant of these is the Game of Thrones attraction, due to open later in the year, said Mr McGrillen, adding that has already prompted huge interest. Tourism NI was supportive of a £m government loan for the operators, though board minutes reveal it took some months before Economy Department officials signed off on the loan, with some discussion over projected post-Covid numbers. In the end, it was not needed as Linen Hall Studios managed to secure private financing for the same amount from Barclay#s Bank.There is a signicant all-Ireland approach to attracting visitors, particularly when targeting those farther away. Those coming from the US are more likely to be spending two weeks and want to travel around the whole island.But the GB market is signicant for Northern Ireland alone, accounting for around % of all visitors to the region in recent years, said Mr McGrillen.For that reason, he added, NI is maybe not as susceptible as the Republic to the drop off in international numbers.NI tourism looks to the summer with some advantages, that foreign holidays will be restricted and that people are keen to spend money saved during the lockdowns.People from GB and the Republic may look and see a place where they have never have been before, said Mr McGrillen.But there is also a huge diaspora in GB, who may normally have travelled back and forth but have not been able to do that and will want to come see relatives and friends, he added.When unrestricted travel will be allowed and encouraged depends to a large extent on the speed of the vaccination programme, but Tourism NI is ready to roll out its marketing and advertising campaign, in GB and the Republic.Last year, during a slow summer, the spend in hotels by visitors from the Republic trebled year on year, according to industry representatives. And they travelled from farther away and dferent places.But the first job is a very signicant marketing campaign aimed at people here, reminded of the places to go and stay, and directed to the Tourism NI website. We will probably also run specic campaigns for Belfast and Derry as people are more minded to go on rural holidays, and we want to make sure they do think about what the city has to offer, said Mr McGrillen.There is the fear that further street protests, potentially rolling into the summer months, could blunt the recovery by deterring visitors.Basically we have spent the last  years building Northern Ireland#s reputation as a tourist destination and images of the last fortnight are not helpful, said Mr McGrillen.Visitors are struck by the friendliness of people in Northern Ireland and violence on the streets does not show what the region is like, he said.But people are mindful of their personal health and safety, particularly in these times. It is highly unlikely a tourist is going to find themselves at a flash point... but anything that makes think twice is deeply unhelpful.But overall the mood is optimistic among the Tourism NI team and businesses in the sector. It is absolutely crucial that we build on the momentum created by a decade of investment and growth in our tourism industry, said Mr McGrillen. As the sector begins to reopen we are ready to welcome our visitors back and are conscious of the many jobs and livelihoods that are now dependent on the tourism industry. We cannot afford to fall behind the competition.Belfast Most ReadNew IRA blamed for bomb attempt on female part-time PSNI officer and her young daughterNI driver who caused deaths of two friends and left a third in wheelchair after high-speed crash is jailedGang of youths attack north Belfast home in hate crimeRadio Ulster’s Sarah Brett reaches Belfast at long last... and forgets where the studio isChristian Jessen denies receiving documents in Arlene Foster libel caseTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyLatest Northern IrelandChecks proposed for Irish land border will not solve sea border issues, MPs toldDUP minister attends north-south meeting after two no-showsTyrone man charged over video of child driving lorry on motorway bailedWork to begin on first-of-its-kind shared education campus in LimavadyTime limit on Troubles prosecutions should apply to all – Veterans CommissionerLatestArmagh teacher charged with threatening to kill principal and her family facing trialBallycastle Hotel’s plan for new restaurant could create  jobsSam Allardyce: West Brom must stop Leicester’s Jamie Vardy and Kelechi IheanachoUK can make history by banning the importation and sale of fur, says MPChecks proposed for Irish land border will not solve sea border issues, MPs told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club had been invigorated at the turn of the Millennium and in the - season they had narrowly missed out on the league title. Hearts and minds were already looking to future progress on the field, but a sudden council decision was to plunge the club into uncertainty, inadvertently removing that field. “In late s and early s all first team games were played at Meadowbank as it suited intermediate football rules,” said former first team coach Robert Rainey. “The Magherafelt council CEO John McLaughlin called a meeting with chairman Glenn Robinson, secretary Brian Rocks and myself to explain the new creation of Meadowbank sports arena. googletag.cmd.push “The team, having examined the council plan, observed that it did not comply with intermediate football rules.” The clubs original mini-soccer center back in . The decision left the club in an awkward spot. Strict conditions had to be met for the Sky Blues to continue to compete at intermediate level and they were about to be rendered homeless. There were limited options within the council area for leasing pitches that would meet the leagues rules, but a solution was found less than a mile from Meadowbank. “At the monthly Sky Blues meeting it was agreed to ask the council to rent out a pitch in Magherafelt known as Stoney Park,” said Robert Rainey. googletag.cmd.push “This pitch was a nightmare to the council as it was open ground and very hard to maintain, so the council agreed to this request from us and a lease was agreed.” An agreed -year lease on the land marked the first step on a challenging journey to creating a facility fit for a club with ever-growing ambitions. The playing surface at Stoney Park lived up to its name and was hard and unforgiving. The clubs plans included the resanding and drainage of the entire area. Work at Spires Park in  ahead of the clubs new committee room and kitchen.     The development would also include an exterior and interior fence, a new two-team changing facility, showers and a separate referees changing room. Consultation with local residents proved just one of a number of hurdles the club had to navigate in getting their plans through. They enlisted local MLA Patsy McGlone to help with their application, and at a make-or-break planning meeting in Ballymena, their plans were approved. With the area acquired by the club known as Stoney Park, the club felt a rebranding was in order and officials convened in a snooker room connected to Anthony Campbells house in Magherafelt. Amid lively discussion, Martin Kerr proposed the facilitys name be changed to Spires Park, a reference to the distinctive spires of the towns three main churches. Linfield played at official opening of Spires back in  pictured was club captain Gareth Cassidy. The committee concurred, and Kerrs canny name change banished many club members memories of the dficult playing surface in one fell swoop. By the summer of , the fencing, painting and decorating had all been completed, in time to allow the Sky Blues to commence the   season in their shiny new home. The changing rooms and referees facility were next on the to-do list, and as the club continued to grow, further upgrades were required. “We knew Magherafelt and the South Derry area was a hot bed of footballing talent,” said former Chairperson Glenn Robinson. “All we had to do was put the hard work into securing Spires, and we knew the club would thrive. The decision by the council had forced the committee to think big picture and long term. “To our delight, we leased Spires Park, redeveloped it, and during the worst recession in living memory, secured and repaid the finance required to do it.” The development of he facilities took a further step under the leadership of Chairperson Brian Surgenor. Office cabins, a small kitchen, disabled access toilet and large meeting space were among the progress, as well as a new storage shed and ball stops at the leisure centre end. With a top class facility in place, the clubs volunteers put their shoulders to the while in maintaining the Sky Blues focal point in the area. BBC came to town last year to interview all the local clubs in relation to Covid-, Thomas Niblock is pictured with Club Chairman Gerry Kelly. Glenn Robinson highlighted the importance of Spires Park in securing the clubs status as an important piece of County Derrys footballing tapestry. “The decision to move to Spires has catapulted Sky Blues as an important football brand and club not only in South Derry but also Northern Ireland,” he said. “Since  thousands of young and old players have used the facility and everyone from the original committee back then to the current one should be congratulated for the work they have put into this. “Football is the beautul game and Spires Park has given so many players in this area a chance to enjoy the game we all love. “Everyone linked with this club should be proud of what they are doing to provide these opportunities.” Last week, the thud of colliding leather echoed around Spires Park as collective training resumed. The excited cries of young and not-so-young players. Yelps of celebration. The sounds of football are back and through years of hard work, the Sky Blues have built an arena fit to welcome them.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club had been invigorated at the turn of the Millennium and in the - season they had narrowly missed out on the league title. Hearts and minds were already looking to future progress on the field, but a sudden council decision was to plunge the club into uncertainty, inadvertently removing that field. “In late s and early s all first team games were played at Meadowbank as it suited intermediate football rules,” said former first team coach Robert Rainey. “The Magherafelt council CEO John McLaughlin called a meeting with chairman Glenn Robinson, secretary Brian Rocks and myself to explain the new creation of Meadowbank sports arena. googletag.cmd.push “The team, having examined the council plan, observed that it did not comply with intermediate football rules.” The clubs original mini-soccer center back in . The decision left the club in an awkward spot. Strict conditions had to be met for the Sky Blues to continue to compete at intermediate level and they were about to be rendered homeless. There were limited options within the council area for leasing pitches that would meet the leagues rules, but a solution was found less than a mile from Meadowbank. “At the monthly Sky Blues meeting it was agreed to ask the council to rent out a pitch in Magherafelt known as Stoney Park,” said Robert Rainey. googletag.cmd.push “This pitch was a nightmare to the council as it was open ground and very hard to maintain, so the council agreed to this request from us and a lease was agreed.” An agreed -year lease on the land marked the first step on a challenging journey to creating a facility fit for a club with ever-growing ambitions. The playing surface at Stoney Park lived up to its name and was hard and unforgiving. The clubs plans included the resanding and drainage of the entire area. Work at Spires Park in  ahead of the clubs new committee room and kitchen.     The development would also include an exterior and interior fence, a new two-team changing facility, showers and a separate referees changing room. Consultation with local residents proved just one of a number of hurdles the club had to navigate in getting their plans through. They enlisted local MLA Patsy McGlone to help with their application, and at a make-or-break planning meeting in Ballymena, their plans were approved. With the area acquired by the club known as Stoney Park, the club felt a rebranding was in order and officials convened in a snooker room connected to Anthony Campbells house in Magherafelt. Amid lively discussion, Martin Kerr proposed the facilitys name be changed to Spires Park, a reference to the distinctive spires of the towns three main churches. Linfield played at official opening of Spires back in  pictured was club captain Gareth Cassidy. The committee concurred, and Kerrs canny name change banished many club members memories of the dficult playing surface in one fell swoop. By the summer of , the fencing, painting and decorating had all been completed, in time to allow the Sky Blues to commence the   season in their shiny new home. The changing rooms and referees facility were next on the to-do list, and as the club continued to grow, further upgrades were required. “We knew Magherafelt and the South Derry area was a hot bed of footballing talent,” said former Chairperson Glenn Robinson. “All we had to do was put the hard work into securing Spires, and we knew the club would thrive. The decision by the council had forced the committee to think big picture and long term. “To our delight, we leased Spires Park, redeveloped it, and during the worst recession in living memory, secured and repaid the finance required to do it.” The development of he facilities took a further step under the leadership of Chairperson Brian Surgenor. Office cabins, a small kitchen, disabled access toilet and large meeting space were among the progress, as well as a new storage shed and ball stops at the leisure centre end. With a top class facility in place, the clubs volunteers put their shoulders to the while in maintaining the Sky Blues focal point in the area. BBC came to town last year to interview all the local clubs in relation to Covid-, Thomas Niblock is pictured with Club Chairman Gerry Kelly. Glenn Robinson highlighted the importance of Spires Park in securing the clubs status as an important piece of County Derrys footballing tapestry. “The decision to move to Spires has catapulted Sky Blues as an important football brand and club not only in South Derry but also Northern Ireland,” he said. “Since  thousands of young and old players have used the facility and everyone from the original committee back then to the current one should be congratulated for the work they have put into this. “Football is the beautul game and Spires Park has given so many players in this area a chance to enjoy the game we all love. “Everyone linked with this club should be proud of what they are doing to provide these opportunities.” Last week, the thud of colliding leather echoed around Spires Park as collective training resumed. The excited cries of young and not-so-young players. Yelps of celebration. The sounds of football are back and through years of hard work, the Sky Blues have built an arena fit to welcome them.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old has become Derry City’s number one goalkeeper this season but has come in for some criticism in the first few weeks of the season. However, Gartside was in superb form last night, producing two vital stops in particular to help his team win a point against the Lilywhites. Gartside denied Sam Stanton when he was one on one with the goalkeeper, and he saved the best for last when he somehow kept out a fierce drive from David McMillan with just two minutes remaining. His manager praised him and his team mates after an enthralling game at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push “I’m delighted for Nathan Gartside,” Devine said. “I’m really, really happy for Nathan because rightly or wrongly he has taken a wee bit of criticism, and his second save down his right side was just outstanding. I’m delighted for David Parkhouse who looked back to himself in terms of hard work and bullying centre backs. Then there is Ronan Boyce, and what can you say about Ronan Boyce, he just keeps getting better and better and better. “The documentary also meant a lot to wee Jackie and I thought he showed tremendous character having been left out in the last game or two, to come in and be really, really aggressive in the middle of the park. googletag.cmd.push “Dundalk have players who have been the best in a generation in League of Ireland football. They have players there who played in the Europa League last year, they have full internationals playing, and they have players who have league titles and FAI Cups under their belts. We finished the game with just two players over  years of age. We played I think  or  local based players, so we’re delighted having gone a goal behind that the response from the players was very aggressive and we had the determination to get something from the game.”        --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dormant accounts are defined as those which have seen no customer-initiated activity for at least  years. Under the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act , money has been released from these unused accounts to the National Lottery Community Fund for distribution to good causes across the UK.

An Gaelaacuteras in Derry, which runs Irish language education,musicand cultural activities, has been awardedpound, to improve their financial resilience by increasing opportunities to generate income. googletag.cmd.push Paacutedraig MacCongaacuteil, Chief Executive of AnGaelaacuteras, said:“We currently receive funding from quite a few funders,but one of our ongoing goals is to become more self-sufficient. We want to be able to provide a valuable community hub and services into the future as we develop our educational, cultural, social and employment opportunities. “In recent years our staff and Board have recognised the value in appointing someone to increase our revenue and help with our sustainability, but we haven’t been able to dedicate the required resources into it. So once the Dormant Accounts Fund opened, we were ready to apply straight away as we already had plans in place and knew what we needed - this just gave us the opportunity to finance it. googletag.cmd.push I’m confident the organisation will be in a stronger position in two years’timeand it should be very clear that the sustainability of the organisation has been increased.” Dormant accounts are UK bank and building society accounts that have been untouched for  or more years, wherecustomers who own the accountscannot betraced. Over pound million is currentlyavailableand money will continue to be released each year to support thelong-termsustainability of the VCSE sector. As part of the first phase,organisationscan apply for up to pound, as part of a flexible and responsive grantprogrammeto help them adapt to future challenges and be more financially resilient.     Kate Beggs, Northern Ireland Director at The National Lottery Community Fund,said: “There has been a lot of interest in Dormant Accounts FundNIand we are delighted to be able to award the first grants. “Weknow many organisations are trying to plan for the long term and thinking about the changes they need to make to become more sustainable. Those changes require leadership, strategic planning, newskillsand strong governance.Those are things for which funding often isn’t available and that’s where the Dormant Accounts Fund comes in. It will provide flexible, multi-year funding and allow a erse range of organisations to plan for a more secure future. “There isalso support for larger investments that will enable collaboration and develop new and creative Northern Ireland-wide or sector-specic approaches to sustainability.” Finance Minister, Conor Murphysaid: “It is great to see the very first initial awards being made from the Dormant Accounts Fund. This funding will support these projects with longer term sustainability and resilience which are at the very core of this Fund. I look forward to further awards being madein the near futureandseeing the positivelonger termimpact the Dormant Account Fund has within the voluntary, community and social enterprise sectors.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, because this did not meet the current threshold of %, the proposed new road sign will not be installed. At Hatmore Park,  households were contacted by the council.

Police have branded the attack sickening and a host of local politicians have condemned the incident. Today we are investigating a sickening attack on a young mother who serves her community both as a member of police staff and as a part time police officer, saidAssistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan, Head of PSNI Crime Operations Branch. The investigation is still at an early stage but a strong line of enquiry is this is the reason she was targeted by violent terrorists. googletag.cmd.push Yesterday morning our colleague discovered a suspicious object beside her car in close proximity to her house in Ballyquin Road, Dungiven. We assess this was a viable device with explosives attached to a container with flammable liquid. This was designed to cause a fireball which would have engulfed the victim’s car and anyone in it or anyone close by, or those calling to the house… What is really distressing is the terrorists placed the bomb at the rear of the car directly at the point where the victim’s  year daughter sits. This demonstrates the complete and utter disregard for the le of a mother and her toddler, which simply beggars belief. googletag.cmd.push While the investigation is at an early stage and detectives are keeping an open mind, a strong line of enquiry is that this attack is the work of the New IRA. Also, it is worth reflecting that the attack took place while the rest of the country were pausing to remember, nearly  years ago to the day, that this group of wicked iniduals murdered a young woman – Lyra McKee – in Creggan. It is clear they are still intent on recklessly targeting honest, hard-working members of our community with no concern at all for who they harm or kill in the process.     I appeal to anyone who has any knowledge of this attack, or indeed of anyone involved in dissident republican, or other violent or terrorist, activity to come forward and provide any information they have to the police. We particularly want to hear from anyone who was in the area of Ballyquin Road, Dungiven during the evening of Sundayth into the morning of Monday th. If you do have any information you need to come forward. It is time for people to examine their own consciences and ask themselves whether they support attempting to kill a  year old child and her mother. Please call Terrorism Investigation Unit detectives on  quoting reference number    , or submit a report online using our non-emergency reporting form viahttp:www.psni.police.uk makeareport . You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on    or online athttp:crimestoppers-uk.org .

Sinn Fein MLA Caoimhe Archibald and the partys councillor for Bann, Sean Bateson have called for the extension of the mph speed limit roll out to include St. Columba’s primary schools in Ballerin and Kilrea. The Sinn Feacutein representatives made the call following the latest announcement by the Department for Infrastructure that further schools are set to be introduced with mph speed limits. Ms Archibald said road safety outside schools was an important issue. “While it is welcoming news that many local schools are set to avail of the mph speed limit, it is imperative that further schools are granted these reduced speed limits,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Speeding is a common issue which is raised to us as public representatives particularly outside schools where the risk of accidents fatalities is much greater. “The mph speed limit is a fantastic scheme which reduces the risk of speeding greatly but it needs to be rolled out wide spread.” Cllr Bateson said there was an urgent need for the traffic calming measures. “Having engaged with local schools, St. Columba’s primary schools in Ballerin and Kilrea, it is without question that there is a serious need for further traffic calming measures at these schools,” he said. “We have sent representation to the Department for Infrastructure calling on the mph scheme to be extended to these particular schools. googletag.cmd.push “We are seeking a commitment that these schools will be included in further roll outs of this scheme and are asking the department to treat both St Columba’s primary schools as high priority.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Responding to an Assembly Question from Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsMinister Edwin Poots said officials were seeking approval from the Department of Finance. I fully recognise the pressures faced by the Lough Neagh fishing industry as a result of the Covid- pandemic, he said. I have had to consider closely complexities relating to the eligibility criteria for a scheme while balancing the need for an inclusive approach. I have now directed my officials on how I wish to proceed with a support scheme to alleviate the financial impacts of the pandemic on commercial fishermen licensed to fish on Lough Neagh. googletag.cmd.push My officials are liaising with the Department of Finance to seek approval to proceed with the scheme. Patsy McGlone MLA has welcomed the progress, but said there is no justication for its delay. It is not clear what changes the Minister has made to the scheme since the Assembly Committee was told previously that it had been cleared by the Departmental Solicitors Office and by the Department of Finance, he said. I have raised this issue with the AERA Minister and departmental officials repeatedly in the Assembly and Committee over a number of months.  There is no justication for theof time it has taken to finalise the scheme. People were promised that this support would be provided last summer. googletag.cmd.push “Many of those fishing families are on relatively low incomes, and they need that support. “It is now up to the Finance Minister to respond promptly and authorise the revised scheme, so that the financial support that has been promised to this sector can finally be delivered.” Mid Ulster councillor Niall McAleer has also welcomed the progress made on the scheme. It is welcome news that a financial support scheme has been confirmed today that will finally see some much needed cash being put into the pockets of local fishermen, he said. Despite the fact that the DAERA Minister Edwin Poots has repeatedly said, as far back as last August, that support would be put in place soon, it has taken over a year since the start of the COVID- pandemic to put this scheme in place, which is unacceptable.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Responding to an Assembly Question from Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsMinister Edwin Poots said officials were seeking approval from the Department of Finance. I fully recognise the pressures faced by the Lough Neagh fishing industry as a result of the Covid- pandemic, he said. I have had to consider closely complexities relating to the eligibility criteria for a scheme while balancing the need for an inclusive approach. I have now directed my officials on how I wish to proceed with a support scheme to alleviate the financial impacts of the pandemic on commercial fishermen licensed to fish on Lough Neagh. googletag.cmd.push My officials are liaising with the Department of Finance to seek approval to proceed with the scheme. Patsy McGlone MLA has welcomed the progress, but said there is no justication for its delay. It is not clear what changes the Minister has made to the scheme since the Assembly Committee was told previously that it had been cleared by the Departmental Solicitors Office and by the Department of Finance, he said. I have raised this issue with the AERA Minister and departmental officials repeatedly in the Assembly and Committee over a number of months.  There is no justication for theof time it has taken to finalise the scheme. People were promised that this support would be provided last summer. googletag.cmd.push “Many of those fishing families are on relatively low incomes, and they need that support. “It is now up to the Finance Minister to respond promptly and authorise the revised scheme, so that the financial support that has been promised to this sector can finally be delivered.” Mid Ulster councillor Niall McAleer has also welcomed the progress made on the scheme. It is welcome news that a financial support scheme has been confirmed today that will finally see some much needed cash being put into the pockets of local fishermen, he said. Despite the fact that the DAERA Minister Edwin Poots has repeatedly said, as far back as last August, that support would be put in place soon, it has taken over a year since the start of the COVID- pandemic to put this scheme in place, which is unacceptable.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For all the hard work the girls have put in, these are the moments you play football for. “The girls put in a sht from start to finish and Im delighted for Marissa and Deanothere getting the goals because it gave us a bit of relief going into the end. “Its one of the best days of my le.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours.

The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

It is automatically washed down after every use to provide a hygienic convenience for its users.His designs have been discussed in the European Parliament and at a United Nations conference in Australia.Michael explained that central to his development of Changing Places was his experience of the barriers to living his le fully as someone living with a disability such as Motor Neurone Disease.ldquoUnless you are disabled or have a family member or friend who has a disability, the likelihood that you have even considered the barriers we face in daily living is nil, said Michael.ldquoI have consulted with people such as local campaigner Michaela Hollywood to find out exactly what people with complex medical and disability needs require from using a public convenience.ldquoA blind person even commented that to find a toilet where the floor was dry enough for her guide dog is rest on was nearly impossible.Michael, who has been living with his we, Jenner, and children, Georgia and Noah, in Darragh Cross since , stressed that AccessoLoo was about improving the everyday experience for disabled people while they were out and about and not about making a profit.He said: ldquoWhat is best about all of this, is that we are producing these items where quality is paramount, but the profit margin is not.

And an influential coronary care specialist based in Belfast has warned that closure of the Downersquos coronary care unit in favour of a thrombolysis initiative would signicantly reduce the quality of care available to the districtrsquos residents.The coronary care unit is seen as the cornerstone of the current hospital campaign to provide lesaving services in Downpatrick.

I thought he did it excellently, he had such short time but he had the room laughing and I think everyone really appreciated it.While Mr Lindsay also met him at St Jamesrsquo Palace in London, it was another Hillsborough Castle event that Prince Philip shared his robust opinion.ldquoThere was only the one time that I talked to him for about two minutes at Hillsborough gates and there was a statue there that he didnrsquot think very much of and he told me, which was quite funny, recalled Mr Lindsay.ldquoI was once lucky enough to have a short private conversation with the Queen but that was all I managed with the Duke unfortunately.Mr Lindsay commended the Duke for the positive impact and benefit his award scheme had on young people.ldquoI do strongly support the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, as I support all groups who help develop and support young people, said Mr Lindsay. ldquoThere is no doubt about it, these groups who help young people make a huge dference as to how people develop as adult and help keep the more vulnerable children away from undesirable habits.ldquoI take my hat off to him being behind a scheme which has been an outstanding success and copied around the world as well.He revealed that previous plans for the aftermath of the Dukersquos death had advised there were to be no memorial services for  days after his death which subsequently had been changed to  days.Mr Lindsay said: ldquoAll along the Duke said that he did not want any particular arrangements and I agree. I think that we should not be holding any special church services or special events within that period.ldquoI certainly intend to observe the minutersquos silence at pm on Saturday but I will do it at home.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control. Irsquove seen people walk in and run out again almost immediately, but once you get used to the process you just feel happy, calm and relaxed and you want to stay in longer.After stressing iables which must be taken into account before hitting the waters, Lorna also lists some essential tips for beginners thinking of giving it a try.ldquoAlways take someone with you in case something goes wrong. Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock. Lornarsquos native Killyleagh have recently formed the cold water group Dippy Flipper swimmers.These groups are highly recommended to beginners as they have invaluable knowledge of the waters they are swimming in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-family.jpg","title":"McAlister family raises £3k for Marie Curie nurses  ","story":"A DRUMANESS family have helped raise over pound, for Marie Curie nurses in memory of local woman Peggy McAlister.The money was raised through a series of Easter activities including a virtual raffle and a socially distanced visit to homes in the village from the Easter bunny.Peggy, who was a well known figure in Drumaness, sadly passed away in August .

Thatrsquos been a big bonus, Irsquove played a few minutes more than I thought I would when I signed.ldquoI have settled in well, which is not always the case when you move clubs. Accrington have a great group of lads on the team and theyrsquove made the transition easy for me. Similarly with the manager, John Coleman. So far hersquos been great with me and is giving me the minutes on the pitch.The highly sought after Morgan didnrsquot take long to make his mind up on his move to Accrington, which is less than  miles away from his home, with everything falling into place at the right time.ldquoI was part-time at Southport so being full-time now with Accrington makes le a lot easier. One thing that crossed my mind about having to move clubs is that Irsquove two young children and one is at school. Itrsquos not easy for children to move so in all respects of teams that may have been interested in me, itrsquos the perfect situation not having to move home said Morgan.The midfielder also noted the dference of both training and playing level at his new club, and how he has adapted to his new surroundings on the pitch.ldquoI treated Southport as a full-time role, despite only training two times a week. Irsquom in five times a week with Accrington. We get as much grass work as possible which suits me settling into a new team so I can understand what way they tick, he said.ldquoI hadnrsquot played for two months before I moved to Accrington, due to the league being cancelled at Southport. When I first arrived I was fit, but not match fit. I got thrown in at the deep end due to injuries and noticed instantly the pace of the game is a lot quicker. You donrsquot have time to take extra touches.Accrington Stanley are currently pushing for a place in the play-offs with just six games remaining before the end of the season.Morgan hopes he can help his new team gain promotion to the Championship, but he remains firmly grounded ahead of the next game.ldquoPlay-offs are the aim, every game is massive and we know that as a group. Everyone knows that is the objective for this season but we must take it one game at a time and not overlook anyone he said.Morgan is also looking forward to seeing theof fans, as he is yet to witness a crowd at his new club.ldquoOne of the big things Irsquom looking forward to seeing is the fans in the stadium. Football is not the same without the fans. You associate the two with being normal and you just want that back, he said.ldquoI want my family to experience the football league. They were constantly taking me places to help me develop as a player. I remember my dad racing home from work just to take me to training and I want to repay that with them watching me in the stands.The new No  also paid homage to his former club as he focuses on the next chapter of his career.ldquoIrsquove a special connection with Southport. The staff, volunteers, the team and the club as a whole is something I have a lot of time for.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority.

The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

The greatest support was for recognising the sporting and cultural achievements of those from Northern Ireland.In the south, just % said that the centenary should be celebrated, while % said that it should not be a cause for celebration.:Sam McBride: The most important firm in Northern Ireland you’ve probably never heard of – but are paying forFarce as loyalist protest group claims credit for no one showing up to its protestSam McBride: On the streets and in Stormont, the next few months look bleak for Northern IrelandAnarchy on the Shankill as men and women urge children to riot, with no hint of political protestStill reeling from Boris Johnson’s betrayal, DUP founding member says he’s questioning the UnionSam McBride: A failure of unionist diplomacy has left it more isolated than for decadesLeaked internal DUP minutes show fear of looming electoral collapse, and dismay at party’s directionBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says parts of frontier are being ditched for goodSam McBride: Northern Ireland is now a proxy battleground for the EU and the UK – and that is dangerousSam McBride: Read the small print – the Irish Sea border may be impossible to remove, evenMLAs vote it down——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Throughout the pandemic, football has been an emotional and mental support during a dark time.The familiar highs and lows of Saturday afternoons have given the pandemic at least some sense of normality. A welcome distraction from the unremitting gloom of le under Covid.But, without fans in attendance, it’s fair to say that football this season has also been a pale imitation of its usual self. And no amount of fake crowd noise can make up for that.It’s this emotional connection to the game which makes the news of a European Super League this week feel like a slap in the face to the real football fans who have shelled out their hard-earned cash over the years on season tickets, travelling to away games and endless replica shirts.\u2028\u2028Of course, it’s no surprise that the faceless, billionaire owners behind the ‘big six’ have taken this stance. To them, football clubs are simply businesses, not institutions with history and grandeur.\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMwMjYMDEz.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMwMjYMDEz.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\"\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"A view of the Jock Stein statue outside Celtic Park in Glasgow. They would no doubt preferthe real supporters could be left out of the equation altogether. To them, these fans are nothing more than a minor revenue stream in comparison to the riches of TV deals and global sponsorship opportunities.The iconic Jock Stein quote in full reads: “Without fans who pay at the turnstile, football is nothing. Sometimes we are inclined to forget that. The only chance of bringing them into stadiums isthey are entertained by what happens on the football field.”In the wake of the ESL news, perhaps we should add that the only chance of bringing them back into stadiums isthey feel invested in what happens on the football field too.Because, right now, fans up and the country feel left out of the conversation altogether.The breakaway plans, led by investment bankers and sharp-suited shills, threaten the fabric and future of English football.\u2028\u2028On the field, the competitive nature and ability of clubs to progress through the football pyramid will be reduced, while off the field, revenues will be in danger of collapsing. This will have a knock-on effect for our communities, not just our clubs.That’s why NationalWorld, alongside our sister titles across JPI Media, is launching For the Fans, a campaign calling for a halt to the ESL, and for fans to have more say in the future of the clubs they’ve grown up supporting, through good times and bad.It’s time for us to have a collective voice, and call on the authorities to protect our clubs and communities.But first, we want to hear what you think.Have your say on the European Super LeagueHave your say on the European Super League fans by filling out this survey, which should only take a minute of your time.You can also let us know what you think on Twitter and Facebook"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/12523391.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors.

Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.
