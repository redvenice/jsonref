In my life when I’ve flown, only once in the last 40 years have I not been called over by customs to search my bags.”She revealed she had made a note of all the headlines comparing Kate Middleton to Meghan Markle and was frustrated and saddened at denials that race has played a part in the media’s differential treatment of the Duchess of Sussex.Asked her thoughts on racial fluidity and whether somebody could just “feel black”, she said: “It’s a tricky one. I believe in gender fluidity and that you can be born in the wrong body. With race, you can admire someone’s culture, but if you’re not born into it …“Can I, for example, just turn around and say I am an Inuit because that’s how I want to identify? There’s more to it than that, it’s about being brought up in the culture. It’s an interesting thing to explore, maybe I’ll try and write a story about it!”Blackman’s autobiography is due to be published by #Merky Books, founded by Stormzy, who has a cameo in the series. In one episode he plays a newspaper editor, a role created especially for him.She felt positive that sensibilities like colour-blind casting in TV and film were beginning to catch up with the times. “That’s why I loved the recent BBC adaptation of A Christmas Carol when Mary Cratchit was played by Vinette Robinson.“Some people complained that a woman of colour was playing her – they had no problems when Miss Piggy played the part though, did they?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b06c4d54da0d08a1ad54f5121eb66377117d36/21_46_3475_2086/master/3475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9127c0d47eadfbed520c75e95817178","title":"fca confidential details data breach","story":"Data breach involved names, addresses and phone numbers of some complainantsThe Financial Conduct Authority has admitted to accidentally revealing personal information of about 1,600 people who complained about it, in an embarrassing lapse for the regulator of Britain’s banks and investors.The FCA published names, addresses and phone numbers in a document on its website, in response to a request for data under the Freedom of Information Act.The response related to the number and nature of new complaints made against the FCA between 2 January 2018 and 17 July 2019. More than half of the 1,600 complainants had only their names revealed. The FCA said it will write to those who had their addresses and phone numbers revealed to inform them of the breach.The personal data, which were published in November, were revealed within descriptions of complaints. No financial, payment card, passport or other identity information were included, the FCA said.The FCA said it had referred itself to the Information Commissioner’s Office, which regulates the use of data, over the breach.The data breach is particularly embarrassing for the FCA, which issued Tesco Bank a £16.4m fine in 2018 for failing to protect customer information.The FCA is also carrying out an investigation into a security breach at the Bank of England. The FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey, has promised to recuse himself from the investigation before he becomes governor of the Bank on 15 March.“The publication of this information was a mistake by the FCA,” it said in a statement on Tuesday. “As soon as we became aware of this, we removed the relevant data from our website.

In January, Lloyds Banking Group said it would be closing 56 more branches this year, while in November 2019, TSB outlined plans to close 86 branches.HSBC said its decision reflected “the long-term change in the way customers are banking, alongside the bank’s need to ensure a sustainable branch network for the future”.It added that during the course of 2020 it would be investing almost £34m in its branches, including “refurbishing and refreshing” 49 sites to bring them up to date.Over the past five years, the number of customers using HSBC UK branches has fallen by a third, said the spokesman.About 46 jobs at 10 branches are at risk as a result of the decision, said the spokesman, adding: “We will be supporting them to apply for other roles within HSBC.” Staff at the other 17 branches will be redeployed to nearby outlets.The confirmed list of HSBC branches being axed is: Bristol Bedminster, Leigh-on-Sea, London Park Royal, Chingford, Swindon Old Town, London Kensington High Street (all closing on 3 July) Blaby, Peterlee, Leigh Bradshawgate, Chard, Wallasey, Royston, Pudsey (10 July) Croydon Wellesley Road, Saffron Walden, Tiverton, Ely, Pembroke (31 July) London Greenwich, London Regent Street, Redhill, Thetford, Sheffield Broomhill, Bourne, Cheltenham Bath Road, Coventry Corporation Street, Heswall (date to be confirmed)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea9a52031b0ce691a84c948a20f299f383cc17bf/0_139_2706_1624/master/2706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e0dccf4643e8b9843ee23f126ffebb1","title":"starbucks worker labor unions organizing","story":"Worker at Orlando international airport fired shortly he emerged as a leading organizer to unionize his co-workersGabriel Ocasio Mejias worked as a barista at Starbucks in Orlando international airport for two years before he was fired on 18 February, shortly after he emerged as one of the leading organizers to unionize his co-workers with labor union Unite Here.“I was fired three hours after another union organizer was fired,” Mejias told the . “They took me to the back of the food court, in a dimly lit area, and a manager fired me over a third write-up for drinking water. That was their way to get rid of me, for drinking water, because they know I was one of the strongest organizers. They targeted me specifically to create fear for my co-workers of joining the union.”Starbucks did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.Mejias’s comments come as a new report from Unite Here found significant issues for some Starbucks workers employed by HMS Host, an airport and highway food service company that has maintained exclusive rights to operate Starbucks stores in airports throughout North America until earlier this month, when both companies announced the exclusivity deal would end.The Unite Here report found that pay for black Starbucks workers was $1.85 less than white Starbucks workers, based on data taken from HMS Host locations between February and December 2019. Though more than 8,000 US Starbucks locations closed in May 2018 for racial bias training following an incident at a Philadelphia based Starbucks location, none of the HMS Host-operated Starbucks participated, according to the report.HMS Host denied firing workers for union activity, but declined to comment on specific personnel issues citing privacy concerns. HMS Host also denied the allegations of discrimination and findings of the report.“Unite Here continues to spread false information about HMS Host with the sole objective of exerting pressure and gaining leverage,” said an HMS Host spokesperson in an email.In the wake of releasing the report this week, Unite Here plans to distribute leaflets at over 700 Starbucks locations in 40 cities around the US, calling on Starbucks to address issues of discrimination and inequity at its locations managed by HMS Host.Starbucks has a long history of opposing unionization at its stores, and Mejias explained that although Starbucks touts a legacy of LGBTQ+ inclusion, he became involved in the union organizing drive due to discrimination issues he experienced while working at Starbucks. These include being told by management he was not allowed to wear makeup, though female co-workers were allowed to do so, and that management frequently made homophobic comments.“They made me feel like I had to go back into the closet while I’m at work,” Mejias added.While working at Starbucks, Mejias made $10.25 an hour, and had to work a second job at an athletic club to make ends meet. Unable to afford the health insurance offered to him as an employee, his mother sent medication from Puerto Rico to him for his epilepsy. He moved to Orlando from Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in September 2017.Mejias and another co-worker, Jay Kelly, a trans man, have filed complaints with the City of Orlando under the city’s anti-discrimination ordinance.“As I changed my name and started to grow facial hair, managers would still call me by my deadname or refer to me as ‘she’,” said Kelly, a barista at Starbucks in Orlando international airport for three years. He said his deadname is still used in scheduling, and managers have continued to misgender him.Kelly also explained the wages are too low to live on, at just a little over $10 an hour.“If I don’t have enough money to pay bills, I have to go to payday loans to get money to feed my nieces and nephews, or sometimes I feed them and not feed myself and go without eating,” Kelly added.Since the union organizing drive began, Kelly said management has held several mandatory meetings with workers to discourage union membership.Grayson Landauer, a Starbucks lead barista at Denver international airport for nine months, is also union organizing with co-workers in response to discrimination they have experienced on the job.“HMS Host has treated workers with so much disrespect, in their attitude and in pay and benefits,” said Landauer. “I’ve been union organizing here because I think it’s time for a change. The management in Denver has responded by trying to intimidate workers about the union, scaring them about dues, and trying to discourage us all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f71b3afba1aaf9ae3da8499ced063494379313ce/0_100_5644_3386/master/5644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86c4c881860a861ec9829ca9485537f","title":"stock market sell off coronavirus companies croda dow ftse business live","story":"European markets are in the red again after Dow plunged by 1,000 points last nightUS shoe vendor Wolverine World Wide has warned that the coronavirus will hurt its profitability, by disrupting its supply chain and cutting sales.Wolverine, whose brands include Hush Puppies, Merrell and Bates, predicts that Covid-19 will knock $30m off its revenues in the first half this year.The Company is continuing to monitor and adjust to the fluid coronavirus situation, and recognizes that there could be additional future impact to the global supply chain or customer demand.The coronavirus is having a painful impact on Italy, forcing several towns to lock down.The Italian economy was already on the brink of recession, and financial analyst Kathleen Brooks of Minerva fears it could be driven in to a deep crisis:The coronavirus crisis is also causing ructions in the bond market.The cost of insuring junk-rated company debt has hit its highest level since October, Bloomber’s Katie Linsell points out.

A merger is for the birds, but the party should listen to himThe Labour leadership vote is at last under way. Let no future contest hold such a purgatory of hustings, forcing candidates to say something new every day: Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey fell into the trans thorn bushes, while Keir Starmer may have overpromised.But how would they feel about the huge compromise that has just loomed over the horizon, proposed by two people some Labour members may be disinclined to hear – Tony Blair and Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey? In Blair’s sweeping – and brutal – tour of Labour’s history at a speech marking the party’s 120th anniversary, he warned of a “make-or-break” crisis. “The Labour party is not an NGO, and not a pressure group. Its aim is not to trend on Twitter, or to have celebrities (temporarily) fawn over it … Our task is to win power.”Listing electoral failures, he blamed a historical structural fault: that first split with the Liberals. “We must correct the defect from birth, which separated the Liberal reforming traditions of Lloyd George, Beveridge and Keynes from the Labour ones of Keir Hardie, Attlee, Bevin and Bevan.” He called for a “whole new progressive alliance” to bring back these artificially separated strands.Frankly, the notion of a merger is for the birds. Although many Labour members advocated tactical voting for Lib Dems in unwinnable seats, that’s a million miles from permanent union – Lib Dems stay unforgiven for coalition austerity. Nor would their members take kindly to mixing their DNA with a Corbynised party. But Davey gingerly put a toe in that water. Picking up Blair’s challenge in the Sunday Times, he wrote: “Facing this rightwing Conservative administration, progressive politicians must at least explore how we might work better together, even tentatively.”Mid-election, Labour candidates may shy away from such treason. But the Liberals have always lain like a water buffalo across Labour’s tracks, as Roy Jenkins once put it. First-past-the-post allows no third party, except as a wrecker, and it has split the non-Tory vote time and again. But the last thing our decaying democracy needs is less choice. What’s needed is a one-time-only pact to not stand against each other in any seat, with a manifesto promise to bring in proportional representation as a first act, needing no referendum.Looking across the Atlantic we see the worst of first-past-the-post two-party constriction, forcing into one bed Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg, making traditional Republicans cohabit with Donald Trump. Under a civilised voting system, the Tories would have split between pro- and anti-Europeans – and there would be no Brexit.There should be a socialist and a social democratic party. Trying to contain both has led to historical Labour strife. Talking to Labour members on a phonebank this weekend, I heard many threaten to walk if Long-Bailey wins, while some said they’d quit if Starmer showed any sign of turning “Blairite”.Four years is a long stretch to the next election, with Brexit and Johnson fallout as yet unfathomable. Labour members are weighing up which qualities will matter most by then: endurance, a rhinoceros hide against all attacks, solid principles and strategic cunning. Some demand charisma, but that may be a fading asset after years of Johnson japes. In my view, a Labour party led by a serious heavyweight former prosecutor, backed by a strong new shadow team, would be a formidable opposition to Johnson chaos and his low-calibre cabinet. To beat a majority of 80 in one election is an Everest to climb. By that time, Labour and the Lib Dems may be ready to make a deal to block another Tory victory.The next few years will be a gruelling uphill slog, watching the Tories do things while Labour can only say things from the sidelines. The party should listen to Blair and Davey: a temporary pact may be the best chance of preventing another slaughter at the polls. A new leader can open new doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e779dcbb9e497a28edf461d6ba31020e549263/0_23_4401_2641/master/4401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92705e5704436b2550e204ece4c0c472","title":"why does anyone want to live to 100","story":"Ask me when I’m 99, but I really don’t understand the desire to go on and on.

After eight years a tribunal could force changes to selectionWhen James Coombs’ eldest son turned 10, it seemed natural to put him in for the 11-plus test. He was a bright lad, often at the top of the class in his Buckinghamshire primary school, and the grammar school was just down the road.So it came as a bit of a surprise when the boy didn’t pass.“We got the results by post,” Coombs says. “Three inidual scores for maths, verbal reasoning and non-verbal reasoning, all given very precisely to two decimal places. His overall score was less than the cut-off mark. My first thought was: How could a couple of hours of multiple choice questions come up with such precise measures?”Coombs, who works in IT and has a background in data science, is not a man to give up without a fight. So he queried the result with the school. “Like a teacher, I said: ‘Show me your workings.’ I thought the school had made a mistake, and that could have affected a number of people.” He could have had no idea that his tentative inquiry would lead him, eight years down the line, to a hearing on 4 March at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in London. The outcome could have far-reaching implications for those interested in how, and indeed whether, selection works.If the tribunal agrees to release raw data on children’s 11-plus test scores, it could open the door to a flood of similar requests from parents – and others. Academics who want to pin down whether grammar school pupils do better than they would have done elsewhere could ask for fresh data. And the outcome just might shed light on the fraught issue of whether a test can be “tutor proof”.Coombs’ son – who prefers to stay out of the fray and remain nameless – went off happily to the local comprehensive in 2013. He continued to thrive, and in 2018 gained excellent grades at GCSE, before entering the sixth form at his local grammar school. He has recently received a university offer to read material science at Oxford.His father, meanwhile, has continued his pursuit for information. At issue is his request under the Freedom of Information Act for data on the raw scores awarded to children sitting the 11-plus test his son sat.The test was set by the Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring (CEM) – one of two bodies that run most of the tests for England’s 163 grammar schools. The score seen by parents is a different, standardised one, adjusted to take into account external factors. These might, for instance, include the fact that children born in August are at an age disadvantage to their September-born peers.Coombs argues there has been a pervasive lack of transparency surrounding 11-plus testing, and that this should be challenged. In particular, he wants to know whether an increase in applications from pupils who live outside Buckinghamshire is making it more difficult for local children to get in: the standardised scores he has been given don’t show this, as they are adjusted so that the pass mark is always the same.It has been a long journey. In 2014, he submitted a detailed request for raw data to the CEM. The centre refused, citing a freedom of information exemption allowing bodies to withhold information on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.Durham University, then owner of the CEM – since sold to the University of Cambridge – argued that to publish raw test scores would undermine its unique selling point: that its tests judged pupils’ natural ability, allowing schools to find the brightest pupils, rather than those whose parents could afford to pay for a coach. A key argument against selection has been that it disadvantages poorer families.Publication of the raw scores would enable both competitors and tutors to understand the CEM’s methods, the university said, which would undermine its efforts to reduce the effects of coaching.The centre says it has never used the phrase “tutor proof”, and its then director said in 2016 he did not support a claim that the test could detect “natural ability”. But it does say on its website that its tests are designed “to demonstrate their academic potential and ability without the need for coaching and excessive preparation”.Its site also bears a quote from a grammar school headteacher who says: “I wanted a test that delivered the brightest boys regardless of whether they could afford to be tutored – and that’s clearly what we’ve got.” reported in 2014 that, following the introduction of the CEM’s test in Buckinghamshire, the gap between state and private school pupils accepted into its grammar schools had actually widened. Buckinghamshire has since dropped the CEM test and returned to one of the centre’s competitors.The years since Coombs’ son was refused a grammar place have been taken up with internal reviews, submissions to the information commissioner, and tribunal decisions. Although a hearing found against Coombs, an appeal ruled that the case should be re-examined.The argument now centres on whether the CEM’s commercial interests are outweighed by the public interest in knowing how the tests work. But the wider argument Coombs makes is that without transparency the administration of the tests – and their social or educational outcomes – cannot be properly scrutinised.“Basically,” he says, “the 11-plus is as opaque as hell. If you start trying to find out information that would be useful, possibly linking it to data on disadvantaged children, you get nowhere.”His campaign is being watched with interest. Prof Stephen Gorard, based at Durham University and a former colleague of the CEM team, has also requested raw test scores from the CEM and been refused.He believes the data could be used to answer a fundamental question: do grammar schools make any difference? Existing information suggests not, he says – in effect, their superior exam results are entirely explained by their intake. Gorard wants to use the data to identify children who passed the 11-plus but who didn’t go to grammar school. He could then compare their GCSE results, he says, with those who got similar scores and who did go to a grammar. In order to get a big enough sample, he thinks he would need to have at least two years’ data.If the CEM released the data, he says, the Department for Education could use its national pupil database to link it anonymously to inidual pupils’ GCSE results and other records.“It’s in the public interest,” he says. “The majority of research shows grammars make no difference, and it’s extremely unlikely this would show anything different. But the approach we are suggesting is as powerful as doing a randomised trial, and that would be a decisive step forward.”Both Cambridge University, which now owns the CEM, and the University of Durham, which used to own it, have declined to comment while the tribunal case is pending.But whatever the outcome, Coombs has lots more questions, for other test providers as well as for CEM – and is determined to keep asking them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e7502a3d7ced244b2b74595932ffc440d080bc/122_273_2878_1727/master/2878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d727a1a82ce382325c1c2e69cf4196","title":"coronavirus closures reveal vast scale of chinas secretive wildlife farm industry","story":"Peacocks, porcupines and pangolins among species bred on 20,000 farms closed in wake of virusNearly 20,000 wildlife farms raising species including peacocks, civet cats, porcupines, ostriches, wild geese and boar have been shut down across China in the wake of the coronavirus, in a move that has exposed the hitherto unknown size of the industry.Until a few weeks ago wildlife farming was still being promoted by government agencies as an easy way for rural Chinese people to get rich.But the Covid-19 outbreak, which has now led to 2,666 deaths and over 77,700 known infections, is thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan in early December, prompting a massive rethink by authorities on how to manage the trade.China issued a temporary ban on wildlife trade to curb the spread of the virus at the end of January and began a widespread crackdown on breeding facilities in early February.The country’s top legislative officials are now rushing to amend the country’s wildlife protection law and possibly restructure regulations on the use of wildlife for food and traditional Chinese medicine.The current version of the law is seen as problematic by wildlife conservation groups because it focuses on utilisation of wildlife rather than its protection.“The coronavirus epidemic is swiftly pushing China to reevaluate its relationship with wildlife,” Steve Blake, chief representative of WildAid in Beijing, told the . “There is a high level of risk from this scale of breeding operations both to human health and to the impacts on populations of these animals in the wild.”The National People’s Congress released new measures on Monday restricting wildlife trade, banning consumption of bushmeat and sales of wildlife for meat consumption at wet markets between now and the time the Wildlife Protection Law can be amended and adopted. Untouched however, are breeding operations for traditional Chinese medicine, fur and leather, lucrative markets known to drive illegal poaching of animals including tigers and pangolins.For the past few years China’s leadership has pushed the idea that “wildlife domestication” should be a key part of rural development, eco-tourism and poverty alleviation. A 2017 report by the Chinese Academy of Engineering on the development of the wildlife farming industry valued the wildlife-farming industry those operations at 520bn yuan, or £57bn.Just weeks before the outbreak, China’s State Forestry and Grassland Administration (SFGA) was still actively encouraging citizens to get into farming wildlife such as civet cats – a species pinpointed as a carrier of Sars, a disease similar to Covid-19. The SFGA regulates both farming and trade in terrestrial wildlife, and quotas of wildlife products – such as pangolin scales – allowed to be used by the Chinese medicine industry.On state TV the popular series Secrets of Getting Rich, which has aired since 2001, often touts these kinds of breeding operations – bamboo rats, snakes, toads, porcupines and squirrels have all had starring roles.But little was known about the scale of the wildlife farm industry before the coronavirus outbreak, with licensing mainly regulated by provincial and local-level forestry bureaus that do not ulge full information about the breeding operations under their watch. A report from state-run Xinhua news agency on 17 February revealed that from 2005–2013 the forestry administration only issued 3,725 breeding and operation licenses at the national level.But since the outbreak at least 19,000 farms have been shut down around the country, including about 4,600 in Jilin province, a major centre for traditional Chinese medicine. About 3,900 wildlife-farming operations were shuttered in Hunan province, 2,900 in Sichuan, 2,300 in Yunnan, 2,000 in Liaoning, and 1,000 in Shaanxi.There is little detail available about the animals farmed across China, but local press reports mention civet cats, bamboo rats, ostriches, wild boar, sika deer, foxes, ostriches, blue peacocks, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, wild geese, mallard ducks, red-billed geese, pigeons, and ring-necked pheasants.Neither do reports offer much detail about the shutdowns and what is happening to the animals, although Blake said he does not think animals are being culled, due to issues over compensation.Chen Hong, a peacock farmer in Liuyang, Hunan, said she is concerned about her losses and whether she will get compensation after her operations were suspended on 24 January.“We’re very worried about the farm’s future,” she added. “The shutdown has resulted in a loss of 400,000–500,000 yuan (£44,000–55,000) in sales, and if they decide to put an outright ban on raising peacocks, we’ll lose even more, at least a million yuan(£110,000).”On a visit to Shaoguan, Guangdong province, last year, the  and staff from CBCGDF saw a caged facility previously used for attempted breeding of the notoriously hard-to-breed pangolin.While there were no longer pangolin at the site, several locals near the facility confirmed the species had been raised there, along with monkeys and other wildlife.Besides being used for Chinese medicine, much of the meat from the wildlife trade is sold through online platforms or to “wet markets” like the one where the Covid-19 outbreak is thought to have started in Wuhan.There have been calls for a deep regulatory overhaul to remove the conflicting duties of the forestry administration, and for a shift in government mindset away from promoting the utilisation of wildlife and towards its protection.Proposals include fully banning trade in wildlife that is protected or endangered within and outside of China, plus bans on raising and selling meat from known carriers of diseases that can impact humans such as civets, bats and rodents.There are concerns that in trying to prevent outbreaks authorities may go too far in the culling of wild animals that can carry disease.Additional research and reporting assistance provided by Jonathan Zhong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5fc3ccb5998cd82cf01d7e25f7903fc46fd1729/62_18_1251_751/master/1251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3520d1f5ae0165eb15ba21f2a8d5b82e","title":"how no take zones revived one devastated scottish fishery isle of arran","story":"Protecting the waters around the Isle of Arran against destructive trawling has led to a massive revival in marine species including king scallops, cod and lobstersAfter the government allowed trawlers to come closer to Scottish shores in 1984, the marine ecosystem around the Isle of Arran steadily collapsed, as bottom-trawlers and dredgers intensively combed the seabed with their vibrating spikes.Now, more than 30 years later and following the interventions of local residents, there has been a dramatic revival in species of mollusks and finfish.A “no-take zone” implemented here in 2008 – after a community-based campaign to lobby the Scottish government – has been a huge success, according to a new report that shows a substantial increase in bioersity.Lobsters are now over four times more abundant in the no-take zone, a 2.67 sq km area where fishing is not allowed, than in adjacent areas. The research, led by the University of York, shows king scallop density is four times higher than in 2013, carbon-absorbing weeds have returned to the seabed, and the area is now a nursery for juvenile fish, especially cod. The lobsters in the zone produce six times more eggs than outside it.“The seabed habitats are springing up,” says Howard Wood, co-founder of the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (Coast). “Without destructive forms of fishing, this amazing, complex seabed allows more species to inhabit, hide and feed. You can see what happens when nature is allowed to thrive.”Wood, a er who was awarded an OBE for services to the environment, led the successful lobbying for no-take zones along with fellow local resident Don MacNeish, who witnessed their transformative effect in New Zealand. Now they are calling for Holyrood and Westminster to sanction more no-take zones around the UK.In contrast to humans, who become less fertile as they grow older, many species of fish spend more of their energy producing eggs as they age. This is one reason proponents say no-take zones – also known as highly protected marine areas (HPMAs) – are so crucial to allowing species repopulation.There are currently four such zones in the UK: in the Medway estuary, at Flamborough Head on the north Yorkshire coast, and near Lundy island, Devon – which has seen a remarkable rise in the lobster population.The UK government is currently examining whether to introduce no-take zones in vulnerable English sea areas, with a review due to be published this spring. There are already about 350 marine protection areas, but as they allow fishing, many observers think they do little to improve degraded ecosystems.“We have thousands of square kilometres of ‘paper parks’, which give the appearance of protection but do little in practice,” says Jean-Luc Solandt of the Marine Conservation Society. “It is the unfortunate case that the government is doing very little to protect our seas.”Trawling, for instance, is banned in MPAs, but there are many reports that this is not effectively enforced. “People are fishing with impunity and we find it flabbergasting that the protected areas are not actually protected,” says Solandt.Last month, marine conservation charity Open Seas accused the Scottish government of “sitting on its hands in the wake of repeated instances of illegal scallop dredging” in MPA’s.But the £120m sector employs about 600 people directly, and another 750 in processing jobs, meaning any further changes would inevitably put some people out of work.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs blamed the EU for the failures in marine conservation. “Currently the Common Fisheries Policy restricts our ability to implement tougher protections but leaving the EU and taking back control of our waters as an independent coastal state gives us the opportunity to introduce stronger measures,” she says.“Targeted HPMAs could complement the existing network of MPAs and allow vulnerable marine wildlife to fully recover, free from all damaging human activities, with the aim of leaving nature in a better state than we found it.”In New Zealand, Australia, the US and elsewhere, large parts of the sea are subject to comprehensive fishing bans.Such zones should be expanded to at least one-quarter of all UK waters, say conservationists. This would allow stocks of fish such as North Sea cod – which have fallen by almost a third since 2015 – to replenish.He says it will not matter how many crabs and lobsters live in the sea if coastal communities cannot make a living from them.But it is precisely the interests of the community that Wood has in mind. “Coast’s most important message is that any environment can benefit from better protection, and every community has the right to a better environment if they want one,” he says.“If that is embraced on a global scale then we truly will see a sea change in the health of our seas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e038ad3240bff4bb928f1d84ff0ef4d6b3628a41/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b8f170d5db58e457d6e79305ab87e35","title":"newly waterproofed arctic seed vault 1m samples climate change","story":"Rapid climate change forced urgent upgrade of ‘failsafe’ doomsday storage facilityThe Arctic global seed vault has reached the milestone of having 1m varieties stored in its deep freeze.

Each sample contains roughly 500 seeds.The Svalbard vault, which is carved into solid rock, houses samples of about 1,050,000 crop varieties from 5,000 species. This represents two-fifths of the estimated 2.4m varieties in the world, and the vault has plenty of room to accommodate them.“Crop ersity is an essential basis of food production,” said Hannes Dempewolf, a scientist at Crop Trust, which operates the vault alongside the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre. “And the Svalbard vault is the essential backup facility for seed banks around the world, safeguarding the bioersity they hold.”“The issue of some water intrusion in the entrance tunnel was certainly not foreseen during construction,” Dempewolf said. “No one thought summers would be so warm.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”.

It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.“A major upgrade was the only right thing to do and the Norwegian government has certainly put the resources up to make sure that it is absolutely watertight now.”Hege Njaa Aschim, a spokeswoman for the government, which owns the vault, said: “The entrance tunnel and the upgrade will secure the seed vault for the future.”The 130-metre entrance tunnel has been fully waterproofed and the cooling equipment that keeps the vault at -18C moved to a new service building, so heat from the machinery can be released outside. The vault is 130 metres above sea level and designed for a “virtually infinite lifetime”.“It is always dangerous to talk about something being completely failsafe and impregnable,” Dempewolf said. “In 20, 30, 40 years down the line, we will continue to monitor the situation to see whether any other upgrades are necessary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b27b38b5741dcace3188623572dee1e3f2084d/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3134c3d90564ffe4e221e35f304e2c10","title":"the end of farming rewilding intensive agriculture food safety","story":"For decades, the way we farm has been degrading land and destroying wildlife. Now there’s a revolution coming – but is it going to create more problems than it solves? By  Christopher de BellaigueIn the last years of the 20th century, Glenfeshie, a 17,000-hectare estate in the Scottish Highlands, was in steep decline. Decades of overgrazing by deer had reduced its hillsides to clipped lifelessness. Denied the protection afforded by tree roots, the banks of the River Feshie were losing soil each time it flooded, the water depositing silt downstream. Those few Scots pines that had survived the browsing of the deer were nearing the end of their lives soon there would be no seed source for the next generation.Between 1997 and 2006, ownership of Glenfeshie passed between three Danish businessmen – and with it a self-destructive business model. Only by maintaining very high numbers of livestock could the flow of fee-paying deerstalkers armed with rifles be ensured, but because of the rising cost of gamekeepers and estate upkeep, Glenfeshie’s sporting operations were still making a loss. All the while, the pine martens, mountain hares and hen harriers for which the Highlands are a natural habitat were being crowded out by the deer on which the model depended.In 2006, the billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, the last and richest of the three Danes, whose fashion empire includes the online retail giant Asos, bought Glenfeshie. Urged on by his man on the ground, a former land agent called Thomas MacDonell, he intensified efforts that had started under his predecessor to bring down deer numbers, with a view to allowing the estate’s woodland to recover and bioersity to return.Glenfeshie is the biggest of the 12 Scottish estates that Povlsen and his wife Anne began acquiring and rewilding in 1996 – in the process spending a total of £70m and becoming the country’s largest private landowners. Although the term “rewilding” – meaning an approach to conservation that allows nature a free rein – has been in currency since 1990, many traditional landowners and gamekeepers continue to spurn both the term and the idea behind it. In the Highlands, rewilding implies that the concept of the country estate as a setting for people of quality to shoot game has had its time. Never very profitable – the Highlands were where rich people came to spend money they had made elsewhere – in recent decades, the sporting estates have become still less viable. As one veteran gamekeeper told me, very few of them actually make money.By 2013, MacDonell and his team had culled 8,000 deer at Glenfeshie, and his local opponents, among them a neighbouring deerstalking enterprise, had camped on the moral high ground. “When they shoot deer they call it sport,” MacDonell said wryly when I visited him last September, “and when we shoot deer they call it slaughter. Also, they claimed it would take hundreds of years for the woodland to regenerate.”We were standing on a track overlooking the River Feshie. On either side, young Scots pines displayed bright green needles against the glowing heather. Among the pines grew rowans hung with scarlet berries, and bilberry bushes whose leaves would be fair game for white moth caterpillars in spring. There were more new trees on the far side of the Feshie, binding the banks and spreading up the hillside. MacDonell smiled. “As you can see, our opponents were wrong.”Over the past 20 years or so, from South America to the Danube basin, ad hoc coalitions of politicians, activists and conscience-stricken billionaires (whose core activities, such as Povlsen’s clothing business, are often less than environmentally friendly), have rewilded millions of acres of mostly failed agricultural and grazing land. Their guiding philosophy – that we should leave the land alone – upends the long dominant view that land should be cleared, ploughed and wrung ever more efficiently for food.Because many of the practitioners are billionaires, and because the landscapes they have returned to nature are (no matter who owns them on paper) our cherished inheritance, and because of a deeply held tradition of depending on the land for food, rewilding attracts controversy. But it is based on a longer view of the planet’s health, which dictates that we use the land not only to feed ourselves in a more environmentally sustainable way, but also to capture greenhouse gases, save endangered species and offer ourselves an occasional break from traffic and hand-sanitisers – that is, to leave town and enjoy the works of nature.The regeneration of Glenfeshie is such a work. Across the hills that ide the Feshie’s catchment from that of the neighbouring river, the Tromie, MacDonell and his team have planted hundreds of thousands of pines, birches, willows and other native trees over the past decade. A few years from now, these stems will develop into a barrier against erosion, a carbon sink and a habitat for distinctive Highland birds such as the capercaillie and ptarmigan. Birds and the wind distribute seeds, while the estate’s deer, whose concentration has been brought down from 40 per sq km to one, are no longer numerous enough to eat all the young shoots. The increased vegetation also provides food for the pine martens, red squirrels and mountain hares that MacDonell is seeing in rising numbers, while the population of endangered birds such as crossbills and crested tits has also risen.For whose benefit? The Povlsens’ Scottish operations currently make an annual loss of £3m, but it is hoped that they will turn a profit by 2027, thanks to clients paying to stay in luxurious accommodation, enjoy exquisitely underdone venison and wander the restored landscapes. When rewilding plans were first revealed, critics of Scotland’s concentrated land ownership – half of the Scottish countryside is owned by around 450 people – expressed fears that Glenfeshie might become a reservation for the rich, but these have been partially allayed by letting ordinary hikers walk across the glens for free.If rewilding seems like a rich person’s indulgence, this is because its economic viability is unproven. It is also a misnomer, for whether by getting rid of tens of thousands of sheep in Patagonia or introducing a living species as a surrogate for an extinct one – Sayaguesa cattle in place of aurochs in Croatia’s Velebit Mountains, for instance – rewilding requires more human intervention than its name suggests. The tourism it offers is limited a rewilded area cannot accommodate many people without undermining its own existence. By erting investment towards repairing landscapes and contributing to the public weal, rewilders are taking money away from conventional economic activities. And this is where its impact will be felt in British farming. Barely a decade ago, the notion that land should be managed in order to ensure planetary wellbeing had few takers among farmers whose raison d’etre was to fill human bellies at the lowest possible cost. But this is the proposition that is now poised to determine the future of farming.Memories of resilience in adversity were inevitably a factor in the growth of intensive farming. When the country was blockaded during the second world war and the nation’s farmers were told to convert scrub and pasture to sown fields, arable land doubled. In peacetime, the patriotic drive for self-sufficiency continued, as the population soared and farmers cleared more land in order to produce more food. Between 1946 and 1963, an average of 3,000 miles of hedgerows were stripped out each year.After Britain joined the European Community in 1973, its farmers received subsidies that rewarded production and – when that led to wasteful surpluses – simply for holding farmland. In 2017, some £2.73bn was disbursed in this way. For decades, farmers justified their subsidies by citing the continuing need for British self-sufficiency in food production, despite the fact that in many cases they were only solvent thanks to European subsidies. During that time, there was still only minimal awareness that the relentless drive for higher yields through intensive methods might be bad for the environment. The few farmers who questioned the prevailing wisdom faced ostracism by their peers.So Charles Burrell discovered in 2000, when he declared defeat after a decade and a half of intensive farming at Knepp, his 1,400-hectare estate in the south of England. Burrell had invested in automatic feeding systems, state-of-the-art combine harvesters and gallons of fertilisers and pesticides in order to coax more milk from his cows and higher yields from the stodgy Sussex clay. But for 13 of his 15 years in charge, Burrell sank more money into the farm than he received in revenues, and the estate was £1.5m overdrawn. In February 2000, he told his employees that he was coming out of farming.“The farm workers … left the office grimly shaking their heads,” his wife, Isabella Tree, recalled in Wilding, the book she wrote about the couple’s experiences. But if liquidation was shocking, Burrell’s decision to seek public money to turn his farm into a “bioerse wilderness”, and his aim to turn a profit through tourism and organic meat, seemed downright perverse.In 2001, starting with a small section of the estate and gradually expanding as funding became available, Burrell stopped ploughing the land and spraying it with chemicals. Removing internal fences allowed the wild Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs he introduced to browse and rootle over large distances, their disruptions creating habitats for other animals and plants. Dung beetles ed into delicious organic cowpats left by longhorn cattle that hadn’t been fed wormers and parasiticides voles colonised the roots of a dead oak that under the previous regime would have been felled in the interests of tidiness. The summer of 2002 revealed wildflowers with delightful names such as bird’s-foot trefoil and lady’s bedstraw that hadn’t been seen in such numbers for a generation, along with a profusion of insects, which produced a continuous thrum – “something”, in Tree’s words, “we hadn’t even known we’d been missing”.Much bigger and more ambitious rewilding schemes than Knepp are currently underway across Europe. But whatever the challenges that face international conservationists who are restoring the largely abandoned Coa Valley of northern Portugal, or those at work in Swedish Lapland (population: 1,000), mass hostility from the locals isn’t one of them. Rewilding in the densely populated Sussex Weald was a tougher sell.In August 2003, Burrell invited local farmers to Knepp with the aim of converting them to the project. As he laid out his vision of fields and hedges devolving into scrub and wetland, his audience erupted with anger. “It wasn’t simply that our neighbours (including some other members of the family) thought this wasn’t right for them,” Tree wrote. “It was more visceral … an affront to the efforts of every self-respecting farmer, an immoral waste of land, an assault on Britishness itself.”By 2008, Knepp was suffused by weeds such as ragwort, whose vivid yellow flowers are great for pollinators but can kill livestock in the rare event that they are eaten in large amounts. In a letter to the West Sussex County Times, a critic resorted to doggerel to denounce Knepp’s “ragwort shame, spread like the plague, and who’s to blame?”When I visited Knepp after heavy rain last autumn, what had been arable fields were a sodden mishmash of young trees, billowing hedges and fleabane stalks, naturally occurring growths that have enhanced Knepp’s capacity for carbon capture. In 2011, Burrell had deliberately collapsed the banks of the River Adur where it runs through his property in order to create the kind of accommodating plain that floods harmlessly after heavy rain.Burrell’s flood-plain and the ramblers’ paths that criss-cross the estate constitute what the government defines as “public goods”: services provided to society without material profit. They have helped quiet much of the local opposition to Knepp’s rewilding. Meanwhile, wildlife tourism has turned Knepp into a successful business that employs more people than it did when it was a farm. Springtime overnighters snuggling down in a luxury treehouse after a soak in the open-air, wood-fired Swedish Hikki bathtub may hear nightingales serenading their consorts they can take home organic Knepp chops to remember the free-running Tamworths by. Tree’s book Wilding has sold so well that its author recently appeared on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, an indication of impending national treasure status.Burrell is nowadays asked about his methods by farmers from around the country. But Knepp is not easy to emulate its success lies partly in its rarity and its aristocratic charm – Burrell is a baronet who lives in a rinky-dink castle. Nor are the farmers who consult him necessarily converts to rewilding. As Burrell himself says: “These guys may not like it, but they don’t know what the future holds and are being forced to engage.”At present, in addition to the EU subsidy they receive for holding agricultural land, farmers who provide public goods, such as fostering wildflowers and mitigating flood risk, can claim EU environmental subsidies. But take-up has been patchy between 2014 and 2017, environmental disbursals fell from £489m to £399m, a reflection of what farmers call the government’s overly prescriptive approach.The brutal fact is that government policy is about to get a lot more prescriptive. With Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the government is scrapping the subsidy system which has kept British farming in stasis for years – and on which the livelihoods of many thousands depend. Under the agriculture bill currently before parliament, subsidies will be redirected at public goods alone. If a farmer does not provide such services, they will have to live off sales of their produce. This may not be a problem for the UK’s bigger farming companies, but impossible for many of the smaller family-owned enterprises whose annual subsidy is currently all that keeps them from insolvency.Hence the queue of worried farmers outside Burrell’s door. Knepp may hold the secret to rehabilitating the tarnished name of British farming. The more candid of the country’s farmers admit that they have suffered a calamitous fall in public esteem. From being the devoted fillers of the nation’s larders and the custodians of rural heritage, farmers, as one lamented to me, are increasingly seen as people who “take public money while raping the land”.Intensive arable farming is designed to raise yields and eliminate pests and disease. The more fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are used, the bigger the harvests. Back in the chemical-free, weed-infested 1940s, Charles Burrell’s great-grandfather was lucky if he got two tonnes of wheat per hectare. Nowadays, farmers using high-yielding varieties would expect to harvest 10 tonnes of wheat per hectare, usually after applying pesticides, ammonium nitrate fertiliser, and a sprinkling of Roundup – a weedkiller found to have caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma among farmers. Overlooking their carcinogenic properties, the right chemicals – and the right weather – bring amazing results. In 2015, a farmer from Northumberland posted a yield of 16.52 tonnes per hectare, winning him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.For all the role that chemicals have played in improving yields, creating a loyal customer base among many of Britain’s 17,000-odd farms, there is a growing appreciation of the long-term environmental damage they cause. With repeated application over several years, chemicals kill the tiny mycorrhizal fungi that supply roots with water and nutrients, as well as earthworms that provide aeration and improve drainage.Guided by Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who advises the government on farming policy, the political establishment has become decidedly sceptical of the old benign image of British farming. Last year, Helm called for the “full scale of the disaster of British agriculture” to be recognised, adding that “no other economic activity combines such a perverse set of incentives, or produces so little value for its true costs”.Even sheep-farming, celebrated by William Wordsworth as a symbol of rural plenitude, is nowadays described as an ecological disaster by writers and activists such as George Monbiot, who argues that the only hope for Britain’s “sheep-wrecked” hills is to reforest them and get rid of ruminants altogether.Converts to the new scepticism include Michael Gove, who, as environment secretary in Theresa May’s government, had a big hand in drafting the agriculture bill currently being scrutinised by MPs. Even the National Farmers Union has committed its members to going carbon-neutral by 2040 – though that goal may only be attainable through as yet undeveloped carbon capture technologies.The agriculture bill sits snugly alongside the government’s environment bill, another Gove baby, which had its first parliamentary reading in January and will enshrine the so-called “polluter pays” principle, according to which dirty industries are penalised at source. No longer can farmers who use chemicals that run into rivers expect water companies and the fishing industry to pick up the bill. Instead, the use of chemicals will be priced according to the greenhouse gases that are emitted while making them and the cost of clearing up the mess they cause – though the vexed question of exactly how the costs will be spread has yet to be resolved.The change that is coming over farming can be summarised in simple economic terms. Intensive agriculture prioritises a bumper harvest – the annual idend – while the new approach emphasises the preservation of the initial capital – the land itself. For a glimpse of how this new investment priority will affect British farming, it suffices to visit those progressives who have already, to varying degrees, made it their own.One afternoon last September, John and Paul Cherry invited me on to their Hertfordshire farm to show how to regenerate damaged soil. Until 10 years ago, each autumn the brothers would laboriously turn over lifeless slabs of clay, which needed to be pulverised with a power harrow before sowing could begin. Then they would douse the land with chemicals to coax forth an unwilling wheat crop. “It was as if we were in a battle with nature,” Paul said.In the 1990s, following innovators in the US midwest, a handful of British farmers went organic or stopped ploughing the soil to make a seed bed (so-called “no-tillers”). In 2010, the Cherrys followed suit, planting cover crops such as clover to reduce soil erosion and lock in carbon over the winter, and cutting their use of chemicals. “That brought us much closer to what nature would have us do,” said John as he poured some crumbling, friable soil reverentially into my hand, pausing to point out some “lovely” wormholes. “It’s a miniature rainforest,” he went on, “with more living things in it than there are people on the planet, full of bacteria and protozoa that are feasting off each other and interacting with the roots of the plant.”Standing on black, peaty ground in the shadow of Ely Cathedral, Clarke pointed out his neighbour’s field, which had been ploughed and was bare up to the dyke that ides the two properties. Clarke’s side, by contrast, featured a 10-metre margin of fodder radishes and wildflowers, a combination that provides pollen for bees and seeds for the grey partridges and corn buntings whose food sources have been depleted by intensive farming. When Clarke was a child, his father farmed the same land using intensive methods. Back then, almost the only wildlife to be seen was “thousands of rabbits.”From Ely, I drove south-east to a farm in Suffolk where Brian and Patrick Barker showed me how they are preparing for the introduction of the “polluter pays” laws. One of the cousins’ fields had been split into two strips, the first left bare after harvest, the second planted with phacelia, rye and radish. Over the winter, these “catch-crops” are left in the ground, where they capture the residual potash and nitrates from last year’s crop in their roots and stop them polluting nearby streams. At the end of the trial period, a comparison will be done between run-off from the two strips, and the catch-crops’ efficacy will be measured. Under the government’s new subsidy regime, environmentalism and economics will – in theory – perfectly align.The Barkers have started bringing livestock on to their fields to provide natural fertiliser – a nod to the old practice of “mixed” farming, whereby farmers grew crops and kept livestock, which went out with intensive methods. Brian told me that he had listened to Isabella Tree’s book Wilding twice while he was manoeuvring his combine harvester around the fields. He found it interesting, “but if everywhere was Knepp we’d have a lot of wildlife and not a lot else”.Every British farmer I spoke to while researching this article has an opinion on what the Burrells have done at Knepp, even if it is to damn the enterprise as tokenistic and unproductive. Environmentally friendly regeneration still has formidable opponents, among them old-school intensive farmers and the agribusinesses that make seeds and chemicals, as well as some plant scientists. In their view, a single unpalatable truth trumps any number of bees and buntings – and that is the looming global dearth of food.For Bill Clark, the technical director of the National Institute of Plant Botany (Niab), a research institute funded by some of Britain’s biggest farming enterprises, this means increasing yields. Clark regards the dispute over whether soil should be productive or healthy as a distraction from the basic choice between being able to feed people or not. “If yields don’t rise,” he told me at Niab’s headquarters in Cambridge, “people in north Africa” – a major export market for European farmers – “won’t simply be unable to afford the wheat they need in order to live: there will be no wheat.”To Clark’s dismay, precisely at the point when Britain and the rest of Europe need a productivity spurt in order to export more to the world, yields have plateaued, thanks to what Clark called the “irrational dogma which says that technology is bad”.Clark is a believer in the power of science to improve the human lot. In his view we have become so blase about technological advance that we overlook the fact that science has saved countless people from starvation. He spoke with reverence of the revolution that highly fertile Japanese wheat wrought when it was crossed with European varieties in the 50s: “The plant halved in size but yields doubled.” Visit one of Niab’s walk-in growth chambers and you’ll see the newest miracle: wheat developed by using a gene from oats that confers immunity to the root disease known as take-all. The new strain can be sown in successive years on the same field without falling foul of the disease (conventional practice dictates that the way to avoid take-all is to plant wheat in rotation with different crops, which naturally lowers aggregate wheat production).It is possible that there is one particular sector of farmers who will not be overly affected by the new agriculture bill. Where economies of size combine with naturally fertile soil that hasn’t yet been destroyed by chemicals, intensive farming continues to be remunerative.Michael Sly’s family has been farming around the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, since the civil war, buying and selling land until Park Farm – as the Sly establishment is called – reached its present size of 1,600 hectares. Whether it is the annual service of thanksgiving he organises at harvest festival, the thousands who visit Park Farm on “open farm” weekend in June, or his chairmanship of the local history society, Sly enjoys the status of – his words – “a big commercial arable farmer”. And while he is proud of the margins he has set aside for bees and birds, Sly’s mission isn’t environmental services. It’s growing food.Sly’s professional vision is defined by his huge fields of sugar beet that stretch towards the horizon, his state-of-the-art tractors, seed drills and combine harvesters, each of which is worth “multiple tens of thousands of pounds”, and his contracts to supply premium grade wheat for national brands such as Weetabix and Mini-Cheddars. He regards wilding as relevant only to “a certain percentage of affluent society”, and his shiny new 2,000-tonne store – which bulged with grains when I visited – is a hymn to the mass market.Sly refuses to commit to techniques such as cover cropping or no-tillage that might reduce yields, and whose commercial viability is unproven. (For all the worms wriggling in their soils, the Cherry brothers’ farming operation is loss-making, and will probably remain so until subsidy reforms kick in.) Sly’s worry is that once Britain has left the EU, the government will remove tariffs on imported produce grown using neonicotinoids or GM, undercutting British farmers. (Britain already imports half its food. When UK oilseed rape yields plummeted following the neonicotinoid insecticide ban, the shortfall was made up by importing Canadian rapeseed oil that had been produced using the same insecticides.)If there is no discernible panic among your fellow shoppers in the supermarket, this is because the prospect of shortages seems so remote from today’s glut. Isabella Tree contrasts the calls of “retailers, agribusiness and farmers’ unions” for the production of more food with “the experiences of farmers like ourselves, driven out of business by … low commodity prices resulting from subsidies and over-production”. Governments of neither left or right dare contemplate measures, such as imposing VAT on food, that would encourage thrift.While the debate continues over the use of advanced genetic and chemical crop-enhancers, technology is opening a whole new direction for food production, which will take farming away from the farm. Robotics and drones are reducing the need for humans to be on the land, while vertical farming, in which vegetables can be grown in sunless warehouses using LED lighting, gene editing and metagenics – the engineering of specific enzymes or proteins – are coming up with new definitions of food. According to a recent report by the thinktank RethinkX, within 15 years the rise of cell-based meat, which is made of animal cells grown in a bioreactor, will bankrupt the US’s huge beef industry, at the same time removing the need to grow soya and maize for feed. By 2035, the report predicts, an area a quarter of the size of the continental US “will be freed for other uses”.Although South American countries such as Brazil and Paraguay are expected to add 11m hectares to the global agricultural inventory between 2018 and 2027, in part by destroying the rainforests, agriculture’s footprint in the developed world is already decreasing, with “more land now being abandoned from agriculture than converted to it”, according to a recent study by the University of Minnesota. Already, as parliament has heard, a lot of British hill farmers are not being replaced when they retire. As a child in London, I heard my mother’s stories of growing up as the daughter of farmers on the Canadian Prairies. There was no Roundup weedkiller, though I’m sure my mother and her siblings, bent double to pick weeds from a field of mustard, would have appreciated it. For my own children, urbanites to their bones, their grandmother’s upbringing must be hard to conceive. Farming is retreating even from the imaginative capacity of most Britons.That many farmers confess to being confused and worried about their future is hardly surprising. The new measures will have a seven-year phasing-in period, at the end of which some of the small farmers who have been unable to adapt will go bust. What is to stop their land being swallowed up by big intensive farmers who don’t rely on subsidies? Others, rather than manoeuvre themselves through the hoops erected by public goods, may decide to turn their land over to enterprises less favourable to dormice and goldfinches: go-karting, motorbike scrambling or parcel distribution.A sentiment I heard repeatedly runs like this: farmers will do whatever society wants them to do, but the sums (ie, the subsidies, or market forces) have to be right.Even if the claims contained in the RethinkX report are overblown, a transformation of the kind it outlines seems not only possible but desirable. When I met him last autumn in a converted warehouse, now a restaurant, in London’s Kings Cross, Tony Juniper, the government’s chief adviser on the natural environment and a former head of Friends of the Earth, described a future in which the cost of LED bulbs is more significant to farmers than a late frost, and Londoners think nothing of weekending among lynxes and beavers in a rewilded green belt.Britain’s farming community is a tiny minority whose public influence is in terminal decline, and is destined to shrink further as technology requires fewer and fewer people to muddy themselves for a living. “The killer irony” of the revolution in farming, said Juniper, in a building that used to receive sack upon sack of golden English wheat, “is that farmers may not be around to see it.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e239a2c90fa1259a7b261afa1903462090987682/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4aace71e51e6dc2b8b49766e9f12404","title":"bohai bay the chinese region disappearing inch by inch in pictures","story":"Farmland, abandoned seaside resorts and salt fields are slowly being claimed by the rising waters, with 100 million people predicted to be affected in China by 2050All photographs by Sean Gallagher for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6117a6330b12a6ab96f074459bd9fdc6903fa665/158_381_6208_3725/master/6208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e148d53ac01676a85dbdd557e2000c8","title":"mens makeup share your experiences","story":"We would like to hear about men’s experiences of wearing makeup, and their reasons for doing soIt’s not the first makeup brand for men Tom Ford, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel also sell male cosmetics, and some forecasters predict that one in four men will use some type of makeup within five years.We’d like to hear from men who wear cosmetics about their experiences.Are you a man who wears makeup?

I have got a Chanel clutch, Marks \u0026amp Spencer gloves – and I made the scarf on the morning of the gala. I remember thinking it needed something else, but I had no time to go home or go shopping. I was working at This Morning and there was an old dress that had been hanging around for months, so I added some fringing I found in their haberdashery department. I have worn that scarf probably more often than anything else in my wardrobe.I love stuff that is homemade and has a story behind it way more than buying couture or designer. One of my favourite shirts is from Asos: it is blue flannel and I embroidered loads of words on it – most of them are too rude for me to wear it on TV.My weight yo-yos a lot – I go from very thin to slightly overweight. It happens naturally, but it would be ridiculous if I didn’t practise what I preach, which is that it doesn’t matter, as long as you feel happy in the clothes that you are wearing.

The unprecedented commercial success of the interconnected, multi-branched nature of the MCEU caused other studios to crave similar long-term profits and so franchises suddenly grew exponentially, in every possible direction, whether they needed to or not. The most disastrous example of this came from Universal who saw the trend as a way of relaunching and combining their many monster movies as part of the newly coined Dark Universe. A logo was released along with a promotional image of cast members from films that hadn’t yet started production, an ambitious yet ultimately foolish gamble given that the first of these, 2017’s The Mummy, was then rejected by audiences and critics.The Dark Universe went dark and instead it became snarky shorthand for what happens when a studio puts too many eggs in one precariously constructed basket. But in what feels like the smartest franchise-reviver since Ryan Coogler’s Creed, at least on paper, Blumhouse and Saw creator Leigh Whannell have transformed The Invisible Man from an expensive, Johnny Depp-starring adventure into a $7m R-rated horror with a female focus. It’s an ingenious way to utilise a widely known character while keeping risk at a minimum (the film will make its budget back and then some in its opening weekend alone) and also to give an old property a fresh feel, showcased quite perfectly in arguably the most effective trailer for the last six months.For the first 15 minutes, you’d be forgiven for thinking you’re watching a remake of Sleeping with the Enemy (something that’s in the works because of course) as Cecilia (Moss) enacts a daring escape from the ultra-modern house she shares with her controlling and abusive husband Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). She makes it out, just, and hides herself away with cop friend James (Clemency’s underrated Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia fears for her safety but when she finds out Adrian has killed himself, she fears something far worse: that he’s not dead and has found a way to make himself invisible.Existing under the same Blumhouse banner that’s housed everything from Happy Death Day to Sinister to Truth or Dare, The Invisible Man is pitched as a classier alternative, shot and structured more like a glossy early 90s thriller complete with a handsome San Francisco setting and a heavily stringed Hitchcockian score. It’s the familiar tale of a hero trying to convince those around that something dastardly yet unexplainable is afoot and while formulaic, there’s a timeliness to its portrait of an abused woman fighting for the right to be believed. Gaslighting has been a practice in film since well, 1940’s Gaslight, but it’s a word that’s only become more commonly used in the wider world in the last three years, following on from a compulsive gaslight-er moving into the White House. Whannell’s reinvention of HG Wells’s text uses this heightened awareness of how toxic men try to control and emotionally manipulate women in a similar, if less effective, way to Ari Aster’s Midsommar did last year. While Whannell wants to say something, what he actually has to say doesn’t amount to all that much. There’s a potentially potent metaphor here for the invisible man representing the shadow of an abusive relationship clinging to the abuser even after it’s finished but human psychology quickly takes a backseat to funhouse scares, with mixed results.There are some successfully creepy sequences as Cecilia starts to realise what she’s up against but given the conceit, there’s not nearly enough inventiveness on display. Bar a handful of sneaky, crowd-pleasing effects, the film’s in need of some craftier suspense set pieces with Whannell pulling back at times when he should be pushing further. It doesn’t help that despite Adrian’s hi-tech job in “optics”, those around Cecilia jump straight to assuming she’s lost her mind despite no reference to any prior mental illness, and so the by-the-numbers back-and-forth (something scary happens, she tells people, they don’t believe her, etc) gets tiring fast. It’s kept alive though by an on-form Moss, in her first studio lead, something of a trauma professional at this stage of her career after three seasons of The Handmaid’s Tale as well as punishing roles in last year’s big and small dramas The Kitchen and Her Smell.While I do crave the opportunity to see her in more films that don’t require quite so much sexual, physical and emotional abuse, she’s compelling as ever here, slickly transferring her skills to a far broader canvas, pushing herself through yet another gruelling obstacle course with gusto. It’s a fiery performance but even she struggles with an uneven final act that goes deep into genre excess with some outsized, and nonsensical, action as well as some ropey effects and a glaring plot-hole that’s left clumsily unresolved. Worst of all, Moss is denied the truly satisfying payoff she deserves. Like much of the film, the final scene opts for shock value over something more drawn out and it ends with a whimper rather than a roar.There’s fun to be had here, thanks to Moss and an involving set-up, and given the state of multiplex horror, especially at this time of year, this is a striking ersion. But Whannell gives us just enough to make us want more and despite the stretched 125-minute runtime, he can’t quite deliver what he loosely promises.

Top tips for the perfect pancake recipeWith hot cross buns already staling on shelves, and mince pies surely mere months away, plum pudding and pancakes are the only two foods I can think of that unite the nation for but one day a year. While more delicate sorts claim to find Christmas pud too “heavy”, I’ve yet to meet anyone, regardless of religious affiliation, who eschews a Shrove Tuesday treat. Why we don’t dare to bust them out at Easter too, or on fine September mornings, is a mystery to me. Pancakes are a remarkably versatile foodstuff: French crêpes, Indian dosas, even Ethiopian injera, all fall under the same delightful banner. As Ken Albala, author of a gloriously comprehensive “global history” of the things explains, “any starchy batter … cooked in a small amount of fat on a flat surface” counts. But in Britain, as any schoolchild knows, modern pancakes are descended from those specifically designed to use up fat before the beginning of Lent, which means they tend to be heavier on the eggs and butter than, say, the fluffy American stack, or the squat Russian blini.Interestingly, the oldest recipe for pancakes as we know them comes from an English cookery book – the Good Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchen (1594 edition) – but it’s even richer than the modern incarnation: a pint of “thicke Creame”, 5 egg yolks, “a good handful of flower” and 2 or 3 tablespoons of ale, seasoned with copious amounts of sugar, cinnamon and ginger.Albala assures me that “the result is a horrible mess” with these proportions (“one can only imagine the author was either careless or had gargantuan hands”), but once I’ve added enough flour to make it into a more workable consistency, I manage to create a pancake, of sorts, from the mixture. It’s so meltingly rich it’s all but impossible to flip, which is clearly no good at all: tasty, but more of a chaser to some roasted peacock and a goblet of sack than one for the modern kitchen.The 17th century ushered in more sober tastes – Gervase Markham’s 1615 recipe uses two eggs, a “pretty quantity of faire running water,” cloves, mace, cinnamon and nutmeg, all beaten together, “which done make thicke as you think food with fine wheate flower”. (No one can accuse these old-school food writers of being prescriptive.) Spice aside, they’re pretty dull things rubbery and heavy. Cream may be taking things too far, but milk is a must. food writer Xanthe Clay uses melted butter in her batter to compensate for any loss of flavour occasioned by cooking them in vegetable oil. BBC Good Food, meanwhile, adds a tot of vegetable oil. The first gives a better tasting pancake, but because I quite like the nutty flavour of browned butter, and the slight crispness of a plainer batter (all the better a foil for crunchy sugar and lemon juice) I decide to include neither. I do take one tip from Xanthe however, using an extra yolk to give the pancakes a depth of flavour without that slight toughness that egg white imparts.Resting batter, like soaking rice, or washing mushrooms, is one of those ideas which I’ve always lazily chosen to ignore – after all, what kind of busy thrusting sort of executive has the time to make their pancake mix half an hour before they plan to eat? Gordon Ramsay says there’s “no need”, Nigel Slater and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall disagree: and suddenly the idea seems almost attractive (even if Nigel does insist on calling them crêpes).I make up two batches of batter and allow one to sit for 30 minutes while I make and devour the other. The first lot aren’t a disaster, but the second are distinctly more even in texture – Hugh suggests this is because the starch has had more time to absorb the liquid, and air bubbles to disperse.Although Hugh and Good Food magazine counsel cooking the pancakes over a moderate heat, I prefer to follow Professor Peter Barham, physicist and adviser to Heston Blumenthal, in getting the pan really hot, because I like mine thin and crisp – you can turn it down before cooking if you prefer a softer finish. Spread the batter as thin as possible for delicately lacy edges – and treat the first pancake as an experiment it usually goes wrong, which is a good excuse to treat it as a cook’s perk. As Nigel so wisely observes, “you could argue that the perfect crêpe is always the first of the batch … Wolfed hot and hissing from the pan, squirted with lemon and a thick layer of sugar - this is the pancake that pleases the mouth if not the eye.”Perk aside, these are also good wrapped around a creamy seafood filling, stuffed with spinach and ricotta and gratinated – or, if you must, slathered with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. I’ve even heard it whispered that the sky won’t fall in if you make them this evening, as well as next Tuesday …Makes about 8125g plain flourPinch of salt1 egg plus 1 egg yolk225ml whole or semi-skimmed milk Small knob of butter1. Sift the flour in a large mixing bowl and add a pinch of salt. Make a well in the centre, and pour the egg and the yolk into it. Mix the milk with 2 tbsp water and then pour a little in with the egg and beat together.2. Whisk the flour into the liquid ingredients, drawing it gradually into the middle until you have a smooth paste the consistency of double cream. Whisk the rest of the milk in until the batter is more like single cream. Cover and refrigerate for at least half an hour.3. Heat the butter in a frying pan on a medium-high heat – you only need enough fat to just grease the bottom of the pan. It should be hot enough that the batter sizzles when it hits it.4. Spread a small ladleful of batter across the bottom of the pan, quickly swirling to coat. Tip any excess away. When it begins to set, loosen the edges with a thin spatula or palette knife, and when it begins to colour on the bottom, flip it over with the same instrument and cook for another 30 seconds. (If you’re feeling cocky, you can also toss the pancake after loosening it: grasp the handle firmly with both hands, then jerk the pan up and slightly towards you.)5. Pancakes are best eaten as soon as possible, before they go rubbery, but if you’re cooking for a crowd, keep them separate until you’re ready to serve by layering them up between pieces of kitchen roll.Why don’t we eat more pancakes in this country – and which recipes are good enough to change our minds?

It was a 21st consecutive home league win for Liverpool – equalling the all-time English record set by their predecessors in 1972 and setting a Premier League record – and an 18th successive league win that equalled the top-flight record set by Manchester City.Klopp’s team have now won as many points – 79 – as Manchester United’s treble-winning team did in 1998-99 and as many league games – 26 – as Arsenal’s “Invincibles” in 2003-04.Klopp said: “A couple of years ago I said we wanted to write our own stories and create our own history and obviously the boys took what I said really seriously.“It is so special. The numbers are incredible. We all know that it is very special, but at this moment we just want to recover and prepare for the next opponent because they are really waiting and want to fight us.West Ham remain in the relegation zone after seven league games without a win under Moyes, although their new manager was rightly encouraged by his team’s display at Anfield.“I felt we had grown into the game and started to earn the right to play,” Moyes said. “We thought there were points there for us. There is a lot I want to improve. I thought in the main we did well but this wasn’t a big game for us. Neither was Man City. These were warm-ups. The big games start now.

Meanwhile, hardware-accelerated raytracing allows for the kind of advanced and highly detailed lighting and shadow effects usually seen in animated movies.The Wire post goes on to mention the inclusion of an SSD drive, and another new feature, Dynamic Latency Input, which promises to make the Xbox wireless controller more responsive.The recently leaked specifications for both the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 seem to reveal very similar machines, both using AMD Zen 2 and RDNA technologies and SSD drives – but while the Xbox machine promises 12 teraflops of GPU, the leak suggests PS5 will be operating at 12.6 teraflops. However, the unverified specs suggest that Xbox Series X will have a slightly faster CPU (3.7Ghz as opposed to 3.6Ghz) and a larger capacity SSD (1TB versus PS5’s 500GB), but these granular details have not been confirmed.With a vague launch date set at “Holidays 2020”, it is likely several more waves of information will be released over the coming months. As Spencer states, “I’m proud to be able to share details about some of the technologies we are enabling for the next generation, and look forward to boldly sharing more as we head towards E3.”Sony is likely to be planning its own marketing onslaught in the meantime, and unlike Microsoft will not be attending the E3 games conference this year. Although there is little to separate the two machines in terms of architecture, it seems Sony’s designers may be looking for unique ways to differentiate PS5 – a recent rumour suggested that the next Dualshock controller could feature biofeedback sensors, allowing game developers to alter the game content depending on the emotional state of the player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0c4ebf2c881da8f587b24457022b2630add11a/0_179_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ed15203147b60852b5c8fa2a7dc4818","title":"love language take out bins give great hugs partner","story":"It has been 30 years since a counsellor came up with the idea of five basic love languages, which include compliments and touch. Here’s how they can help you relate to your partnerPerhaps your partner is a gift-giver who often spots things they think you would love, from a funny-shaped leaf to a rare first edition, but is hurt when you don’t seem that grateful. Maybe you painstakingly undertake DIY around the house, but it goes unnoticed. There is a strong possibility that you and your partner see these acts completely differently.According to the Five Love Languages, written by Gary Chapman, a Christian pastor and relationships counsellor, we each have a “language” in the way we express and would like to receive love and affection. The book was first published in 1992 and the relationship therapists I speak to still use its ideas.“Talking about love languages is a really good way for people to talk about how they need to be loved,” says Simone Bose, a relationship therapist and spokeswoman for Relate. “I find that when there is conflict with couples, or they feel the intimacy is not there – they might say: ‘You don’t show me love’ or ‘You don’t show me appreciation’ – and that’s a good time to bring this into the conversation. How do you like to feel appreciated? How do you like to feel loved? Because appreciation and love can feel quite similar when you’re in a long-term relationship. How do you feel seen?”According to Chapman, there are five basic love languages: words of affirmation (such as saying to your partner “I love you”, or paying them compliments) quality time (phones away, television off, unided attention) receiving gifts acts of service (such as making a nightly hot-water bottle, or taking on the household jobs you know your partner dislikes) and physical touch. Chapman believes we have a “primary” love language (there is a questionnaire on his website), and he notes that, in his experience, couples seldom share the same one.Moyle says this idea can be helpful. “I think it’s a clever concept because it’s so simple and so relatable,” she says. “Understanding your primary love language and your partner’s can break through that communication barrier – and we know the communication barrier is the biggest, most common issue in any relationship in terms of misunderstanding.”The framework, writes Chapman, can also improve and illuminate all kinds of relationships, such as those with our parents, children and friends, if we work out what their love languages are.Moyle says she recommends that most of the couples she works with look at the idea of love languages. “We’re all inidual, all have our own backgrounds, our own stories, so it’s understandable that we’re not all going to show love in the same way. It can really help couples to move through an impasse if they are feeling misunderstood, or if they feel they are trying really hard, but not getting anywhere. It’s a tool for helping us to understand each other better.”One person might feel they are showing their partner love in the best way they know how – they are the ones who change the bed linen, or plan the holidays, or make time to listen – but the other person might not appreciate it, or even notice. “That’s when this conversation is really good because you find out that they would prefer to be told – they will say: ‘You never tell me that you love me,’” says Bose. It could be as simple as telling your partner what is most meaningful to you, though this isn’t always easy. “I find that people feel quite vulnerable about saying these things – they don’t want to appear needy.”It may be difficult for a partner to provide more of what the other would like in some cases, it might mean having to rewrite everything they think they know about affection – lessons from observing their parents’ relationship, the love they were shown in childhood, the norms of their culture, and what they have picked up from books or films.Chapman acknowledges that physical touch may be particularly awkward for someone who is not naturally tactile. He recommends starting small: “Begin with small things such as putting your hand on her shoulder as you pour a cup of coffee,” he writes. If giving “words of affirmation” feels unnatural, he advises making “a list of statements you hear from other people or that you read or hear in the media” and practising saying them in front of a mirror.Although it might sound a little clinical, Bose says: “A lot of the time, it’s about building new habits. Be more conscientious of your actions when you’re around your partner, get better at reading them if they look like they could do with a hug or kind words.” And be mindful of how your partner may be showing you love. Maybe they like buying gifts, even if you’d rather they didn’t. “Allow them that space to express themselves without dismissing it.”Bose finds that, although it was a good way to get people talking in counselling sessions, many people wouldn’t find they had a “primary” love language, but were fairly split across them all. This has been one of the criticisms of the idea. (I tried to find my own love language and decided all of them would do nicely, but perhaps I’m just greedy.)Any couples counsellor will tell you communication is key to a healthy relationship, and even the most sceptical would agree that exploring the love languages can spark a deeper conversation. In day-to-day life, trying out the theory needn’t require a huge amount of time, effort or expense – even those who love to receive gifts appreciate the thoughtfulness, rather than the money spent.Prioritise and create quality time with your partner and be aware of physical touch (not sex, necessarily for a partner whose primary love language is touch, Chapman recommends sitting close to them while watching TV, or a brief touch as you walk through the room). “It can be something simple like taking the bins out or putting everything away,” says Moyle.“It’s not necessarily huge statements. A lot of the time it’s about the little things. Saying thank you, showing someone you appreciate them.

Plus: Alok Jha on the ethics of gene editingIt was deep into injury time in the final match of the 2011-12 season and Manchester City needed a goal to win the Premier League with just seconds remaining. The Argentinian striker Sergio Agüero jinked past a QPR defender and smashed the ball into the net, sending the crowd into raptures and securing the club’s first league title for more than 30 years. More were to follow as the Manchester City trophy cabinet filled up over subsequent years, fuelled by a multimillion-pound spending spree on the world’s best players. All of it financed by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi’s royal family.  But after emails emerged in the German magazine Der Spiegel that appeared to show City had been flouting Uefa’s financial fair play rules, the club were put on notice for a possible sanction. When it came this month it shocked the world of football: a two-year ban from Europe’s most prestigious and lucrative club competition, the Champions League.  ’s David Conn has been following City’s fortunes for decades and lays out the rise of the club under its new owners with seemingly unlimited cash. He tells Rachel Humphreys that, despite the furious denials from City, the club could find itself out in the cold if its appeal fails and the ban is upheld.

The EU also fears that current suppliers of meat to the UK could be undercut by US imports.It is understood that France’s proposal to change the negotiating mandate had full backing from other member states.It was agreed last Friday while other “level playing field” provisions only received unanimous support on Monday from EU ambassadors.EU ministers will sign off on the 46-page negotiating mandate for Barnier on Tuesday before the start of talks next week.More generally, a debate had been ongoing between the French government, which wanted to tie the UK completely to the developing EU rulebook on environmental, social and workers’ standards, and other member states who believed it would be a demand too far.Following agreement by ambassadors, the EU will now demand the right to punish Britain if the government fails to shadow the Brussels rulebook in the future but they will not insist on “dynamic alignment” across the board.The compromise involves Brussels retaining the right to apply tariffs or other sanctions if any ergence between the two sides over time led to “disruptions of the equal condition of competition”, with EU law being the “reference point”.“It is about equality of outcomes,” one senior EU source said.The leaked agreement, obtained by the , states “the envisaged agreement should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with union standards as a reference point”.The EU also wants to establish a “governing body” to oversee a deal that “should be empowered to modify the level playing field commitments in order to include additional areas or to lay down higher standards over time”.France was alone in holding out for guarantees to go beyond mere “non-regression” from the current shared regulations.The bloc will also demand that the British government apply EU state aid rules in their entirety as they evolve – the one instance where Brussels is demanding complete alignment over time. The rules limit subsidies that can be given to industry.Barnier has admitted that such a policy is a “red rag” to the UK.Before the meeting of EU ministers, France and Germany also warned Boris Johnson about backsliding on commitments made under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, after reports suggested ministers were looking for ways around the Irish sea border, agreed with the EU last year.Germany’s European affairs minister, Michael Roth, said: “My message is crystal clear to our friends in London: keep your promises based on the protocol.”Amélie de Montchalin, France’s Europe minister, said the EU had a “robust and “precise” mandate.She said the EU would have a mechanism to sanction the UK for potential violations of EU standards. “Zero tariffs, zero quotas, it is possible if there is zero dumping, but that does not mean zero control.”“Our position, it’s not a position of revenge, or punishment or sanction, it is a position that is economically rational,” she said. “I have heard that British companies would like continued access to European markets, they know well that means respecting sanitary and production standards.”The Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, said negotiations would be complicated, given the range of interests at stake, including fisheries, trade, security and people to people contact. “I really hope that we will manage to reach an agreement with the UK before the end of the year,” he said.“The time pressure is immense, the interests are huge, it’s a very complicated treaty, so it will be very hard work.”Andreja Metelko-Zgombić, Croatia’s state secretary for European affairs, who is chairing the meeting, said the mandate was precisely defined. “It is ambitious, wide-ranging and our negotiator will have a good framework for future negotiations. Of course it is up to the parties when they sit around the table how far they are willing to come.”The UK is likely to publish its plans on Thursday. The government has said it will reject any deal that involves alignment on policy or Britain remaining under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. The UK is insisting that a Canada-style trade deal, with looser provisions on ensuring a competitive level playing field, is the most appropriate option.The EU’s position was backed by the National Farmers’ Union whose president, Minette Batters, said it would be “morally bankrupt” and “insane” of Johnson to drop the UK’s high farming and food standards in order to strike a US deal.She raised concerns that Johnson had dismissed concerns over American animal welfare and food standards as “hysteria” and “mumbo jumbo” in a keynote speech in Greenwich three weeks ago.“To sign up to a trade deal which results in opening our ports, shelves and fridges to food which would be illegal to produce here would not only be morally bankrupt. It would be the work of the insane”.She said the concern was not just the chlorine or lactic acid wash that the US allowed in its food production but the use of antibiotics in countries such as Japan, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, Malaysia and India."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35857831bde527a3d5c9614ea50f4cd6d0b2995c/0_161_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3388d5a4ebe63614e1d248b5cadef41b","title":"post brexit trade talks what are the next steps","story":"What can we expect from the talks that begin next week?Brexit negotiations to secure the future relationship between the UK and the EU start next Monday.European affairs and foreign affairs ministers meet in Brussels to rubber-stamp the negotiating goals approved in Brussels on Monday.At the same time Boris Johnson is to convene a meeting on Tuesday of the UK’s exit strategy team (XS) to discuss the EU paper and finalise the UK’s own mandate, which will be published on Thursday.The XS team is made of up Johnson the chancellor, Rishi Sunak the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the attorney general, Suella Braverman – all ardent Brexiters.Expect no let-up in the war of words, with the UK trying to control the narrative in a way Johnson and his special adviser, Dominic Cummings, feel Theresa May failed to do.This means continued demands for access to the EU market without conditions such as alignment with EU regulations and continued rows about the arrangements for Northern Ireland.Negotiations start next Monday, 2 March, with 10 rounds of meetings between the EU and the UK every three weeks thereafter with a view to a Brexit deal sealed by the middle of October.Talks will alternate between Brussels and London, with Michel Barnier’s team expected to hold press conferences in the British capital on the Friday of every negotiating week.The main objective outlined in the EU’s negotiating goals published on Tuesday is to secure a deal that will guarantee a tariff-free, quota-free trading relationship between the two sides from next January, when the Brexit transition period ends.But the EU is insisting that such “generous” access to a market of 350 million people comes only on condition that the UK operates a “level playing field”, maintaining standards on environment, waste, workers’ rights, and state aid or business subsidies.Draft objectives were published at the beginning of the month but France secured a key change which will mean the UK stays close to the EU standards on environment as they change.This means sticking to animal welfare standards including a ban on chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef as well as key issues such as waste.Paris is concerned that if the EU standards are not the reference point for the UK then British companies will be able to undercut their European rivals.The deal does not go as far as a demand for “dynamic alignment” of regulations, which would oblige the UK to follow EU directives every time they changed.It wants a tariff-free, quota-free access to the EU but with none of the conditions on EU regulations. Johnson argued in a speech earlier this month that the UK does not need such obligations as it already has higher standards in some cases than EU member states and this is nothing to do with EU laws.Yes. A major row is brewing on the special arrangements for Northern Ireland but there are also differences over fisheries. In the political declaration agreed by Johnson and the EU in October both sides agreed that there should be a fisheries deal by 1 July. EU countries want continued access to British fishing waters, something Johnson is determined not to concede. Experts believe Johnson will bust the deadline to achieve the upper hand in negotiations. But the EU is insisting there will be no trade deal without a fishing deal in the net first.Yes. Negotiations on freedom of movement for British citizens settled in the EU are also on the table as is their unconditional right to bring EU spouses and other family members back to the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e907601783ca8fe6b2df34390d0823c660959b1d/129_0_691_415/master/691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f4d0f5532db7087df4068c1674bac94","title":"tory mp james grundy apologises after exposing himself in pub","story":"James Grundy, MP for Leigh, dropped his trousers at private event in 2007A Conservative MP has apologised after he was filmed flashing his genitals in a pub.James Grundy dropped his trousers at a private event in the bar, with onlookers encouraging him to expose himself.

The first round of talks is expected in Brussels on Monday, with a second round taking place in London later in March.This morning the French Europe minister Amélie de Montchalin gave quite a lengthy interview to reporters when she arrived at the general affairs council meeting.

The EU is now ready to start negotiations.Tony Blair has not endorsed any of the three candidates left in the Labour leadership contest. Despite being the only person alive to have won a general election for Labour, as he put it in his speech last week “it’s not as if my advice is particularly welcome to today’s party”. He said he would not be endorsing a leadership candidate because he did not want to “damage anyone by supporting them”.But he has decided to endorse a candidate for the deputy leadership. He is backing Ian Murray. Explaining why in a statement, Blair says:All of the candidates in this leadership election are wrestling with the inescapable fact that Labour’s lost four times in a row and that it has to be able to win power in order to put its principles into practice, and to bring about real change in the country.And that’s a huge challenge for the Labour party.Ian Murray understands that if Labour is to have any hope, it’s got to be able to win in every part and every corner of the United Kingdom.It’s got to have a bold vision and programme, but it’s got to be a programme realistic enough to win power.Only in that way can we bring about real change. Only in that way can we bring about a government for the future, and not return to being a protest movement of the past.Ian Murray gets it, and that’s why it’s important to support him.Gordon Brown, the only other former Labour prime minister still alive, is also backing Murray. (Brown first announced this last month.) And, in a statement released this morning, Murray has also published endorsements from Lady Smith, widow of the former Labour leader John Smith (or “Labour’s greatest prime minister that never was”, as Murray calls him in the press release), from Roy Hattersley, the former Labour deputy leader and from Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor.My colleague Lisa O’Carroll is covering the National Farmers Union conference in Birmingham.

As the official list (pdf) shows, there are now five ministers who attend: the PM, the chancellor, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the foreign secretary and the attorney general. The Brexit secretary used to attend, but that post has now been abolished.As Mujtaba Rahman, the Brexit specialist at the Eurasia Group consultancy points out, the replacement of Sajid Javid by Rishi Sunak as chancellor makes a significant difference.Jack Blanchard makes the same point in his London Playbook briefing. He writes:In XS: What really jumps out now the negotiations are about to begin is just how fervently Brexiteer-y the all-important XS committee looks. The departure of Sajid Javid as chancellor means every single member of this critical decision-making group – Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak, Dominic Raab and Suella Braverman – was a Vote Leave campaigner in 2016. The replacement of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox with Braverman, a former ERG chairwoman, brings an even more hardline feel to the room. And with senior No 10 aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain also central to proceedings, this really is the Vote Leave government writ large. There will be no dissenting voices as Britain’s strategy is agreed.EU ministers at the general affairs council have just approved the mandate for the trade negotiations with the UK, the BBC’s Adam Fleming reports."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a6a2207406240ad3bfa6f1a8a5bb5ae0f663274/0_245_1633_980/master/1633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dda98d703893b2925f344e9a17e7de68","title":"from the tech hound to the new parents what kind of skier are you","story":"Whether you’re skiing for the first time, a show-off or après-ski royalty, here’s how to make the most of the slopes this seasonThe tech hound may be looking at you but they’re not actually listening to a word you say. They’re too busy analysing their data – which they’ll share with you at every opportunity. Speed, distance, altitude, vertical drop, crystals captured … friends of the tech hound may want to take their own noise-cancelling headphones on holiday.The tech hound laughs in the face of unplugging for a digital-free ski break. They have a camera in their helmet, an augmented reality version of the slopes playing in their goggles and smart boots fitted with a wearable device to deliver real-time audio ski coaching tips via an app. They’d be filming it all on their drone if the devices weren’t banned from most ski resorts.Tips for tech hounds: Check in with your resort to see what tech is on offer before you arrive. For instance, Club Med has introduced digital RFID bracelets, which provide room access and easy payment around the resort property. Perfect for the techy on the slopes.For the show-off, the mountain is a mere background wallpaper in the story of their life, the gondola is a place to do their makeup, and their skis purely a means of transport to push from one epic selfie spot to another. Of which there are so many all around.The show-off works best on bluebird days and hides in the hotel during photographically challenging blizzards or whiteouts. They used to hang out at the snow park taking selfies at the top of the half pipe until someone pushed them off the lip one day. They got stuck in the centre and had to be pulled out by mountain rescue on a skidoo. Still, it made a good Instagram story.Tips for show-offs: Keep your phone in an inside jacket pocket as close to your body as possible, as cold temperatures will make your battery run out more quickly.Resort pick: Club Med Val Thorens is the perfect base to tick off the 3 Vallées selfie spot trail.“How hard can it be?” thought the first-timer. They’d seen Ski Sunday and watched a couple of YouTube tutorials on the flight over. The first-timer was used to success, unaccustomed to failure, which might explain why they asked for expert skis at the hire shop. And then proceeded to almost twist a knee when their binding didn’t release during a pile-up, which they themselves had caused by skiing into a group getting off the chairlift.At least it saved them from taking on the icy black run they were about to attempt, though. The lifties bundled the first-timer back down the way they came, to the safety of the green runs and covered magic carpet. And there they skied, with their bum in the air as is the form for all beginners who don’t have lessons, being overtaken by kids half their size, until the end of their holiday.Tips for first-timers: Get lessons. There’s no shame in ski school. It’s the quickest way to progress, and even advanced skiers will improve with some tailored tuition. And thanks to Club Med’s partnership with Ecole du Ski Français (ESF), customers get free lessons (available Monday to Friday).Après-ski royalty does not care about first lifts. They’re not even sure they exist, though they did hear someone mention the concept once. Just before midday is when après-ski royalty likes to head up the mountain to avoid the afternoon lift pass rush. Queues are not their scene at all.They might do a red run, a quick head-clearer, with a pace and poise that belies the little amount of time they actually spend on snow rather than in the bar. And then it’s time to settle down for lunch at a sunny outdoor deck with a cocktail or two, moving to each new après spot like clockwork with the sun as it shifts around the mountain.At three, it’s time for the VIP bar at La Folie Douce, where they’ll dance on a table draped in a sea of feather boas. Obvs. As the sun starts to set, après-ski royalty styles it down the mountain and heads home.Tips for après-ski royalty: Research happy hour slots and the best après spots in advance so you can plan your route with precision.Resort pick: Club Med Alpe d’Huez is a top resort for après-ski vibes, with one of the finest Folie Douce in the Alps.The new parents stand at the top of the chairlift scratching their heads. They’re sure they’ve forgotten something. Gloves, poles, phone, oh yes, they remember, we have a child now! But it’s OK, she’s in nursery today. Blinking into the morning sun, the dad remembers he left his goggles on the changing mat, while the mum wonders if the white on her jacket is milk, baby sick or snow.Then they push off – it feels weird at first, but they embrace their newfound freedom, skiing together in the endless white. It’s just like the old days, except this morning they have the slopes to themselves as only new parents and powder hounds are up this early.They’re exhausted by lunchtime and downing double espressos to get through the afternoon, but they return to their child with a sparkle in their eyes.

Real cuts to people’s incomes are damaging the nation’s health for the long term. Not only are lifes stalling, but people are living for more years in poor health.“This damage to the nation’s health need not have happened. It is shocking,” said Marmot, who is the director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity.“The UK has been seen as a world leader in identifying and addressing health inequalities but something dramatic is happening. This report is concerned with England, but in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the damage to health and wellbeing is similarly unprecedented.“Austerity has taken a significant toll on equity and health, and it is likely to continue to do so. If you ask me if that is the reason for the worsening health picture, I’d say it is highly likely that is responsible for the life expectancy flat-lining, people’s health deteriorating and the widening of health inequalities.“Poverty has a grip on our nation’s health – it limits the options families have available to live a healthy life. Government health policies that focus on inidual behaviours are not effective. Something has gone badly wrong.”The report shows that health has worsened in many of the “red wall” constituencies that backed Brexit and returned Boris Johnson’s government to power by voting Conservative for the first time. Voters in the new Tory-held seats can expect to live for 60.9 years in good health life, fewer than in both the long-held Tory seats (65 years) and the Labour seats (61.4 years).Boris Johnson’s government has promised to “level up” those areas. To do that, says review, they will need to take immediate action to stop the deterioration in health.Responding to the report, Downing Street reiterated its promises, but would not be drawn on whether Johnson felt any sense on responsibility given the period covered took place under Conservative rule.The PM’s spokesman said: “Every single person deserves to lead a long and healthy life, no matter who they are, where they live or their social circumstances.“The prime minister has been very clear from his very first day in office that he is committed to levelling up the whole country. While life expectancy is increasing we know that it isn’t for everyone, and so we must tackle the gaps that exist.”Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the Health Foundation, which commissioned the review, said this levelling up “will require the government to go further than investment in infrastructure – building bridges, train lines and new hospitals. It must also invest in the circumstances in which people live that have powerful impacts on their health and wellbeing, such as poverty, employment, housing and education. The evidence is clear and the solutions are there – what is needed is the will to act.”Marmot says the worsening of our health cannot be written off as the fault of iniduals for living unhealthy lives. Their straitened circumstances and poor life chances are to blame. His institute’s work has established that healthy lives depend on early child development, education, employment and working conditions, an adequate income, and a healthy and sustainable community in which to live and work.Austerity has taken its toll over the last 10 years in all of these areas, says Marmot in a foreword to the report. “From rising child poverty and the closure of children’s centres, to declines in education funding, an increase in precarious work and zero hours contracts, to a housing affordability crisis and a rise in homelessness, to people with insufficient money to lead a healthy life and resorting to food banks in large numbers, to ignored communities with poor conditions and little reason for hope … Austerity will cast a long shadow over the lives of the children born and growing up under its effects.”He dismisses the argument made by government in the past that stalling life expectancy was about more severe winters or flu. It impacts the poorest more than the most affluent. It is also more marked in the UK than it is in most high-income countries, except for the US.“If you go back 100 years, from the end of the 19th century, life expectancy just kept increasing by about one year every four years,” Marmot told the . The dramatic change in the curve began around 2010, he said. “It’s not due to a winter effect, because the slowdown was seven-eighths as big in the non-winter quarters.”“You talk to local authority after local authority around the country, and they say, ‘We can’t do any more.’ We are closing youth centres, we’re closing Sure Start children’s centres and we are closing libraries, and parks and recreation centres. We can scarcely do what we have to do to fulfil our statutory duty,” said Marmot.The president of the Royal College of Physicians, Prof Andrew Goddard, said the review painted “a stark picture”, adding: “We agree with Sir Michael that there is a need for a national strategy to tackle health inequalities, as the solutions needed cut across many government departments including education, business and housing. This is a wake-up call for the government to act quickly and strategically to improve the health of people in deprived areas.”Councillor Ian Hudspeth, the chairman of the Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board, also called the report a wake-up call: “Councils want to work with government on closing this gap by focusing on the social causes of ill-health, such as early years development, education and employment opportunities and improving services for older people. Sustainable, long-term investment in councils’ public health services is also needed.”Imran Hussain of Action for Children said the report “delivers a devastating judgment on a decade of crippling cuts to lifeline services like Sure Start and benefits for families fighting to keep their heads above water.The government claimed it was working to reduce health inequalities. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “I thank Professor Sir Michael Marmot for his dedicated work to shine a light on this vital issue. His findings show just how important this agenda is, and renew my determination to level up health life expectancy across our country. After all, levelling up health is the most important levelling up of all.“There is still much more to do, and our bold prevention agenda, record £33.9bn a year investment in the NHS, and world-leading plans to improve children’s health will help ensure every person can lead a long and healthy life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65c621f44bbf45bc502df4e75e8a59d85582c97/0_276_4888_2932/master/4888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7bfc973d714c59ea4ffa954dfa0b002","title":"health inequalities fractured government invest solution","story":"The government needs to invest in the social glue that binds us if we are to live better and longer againEngland has lost a decade,” Sir Michael Marmot said this week as he presented his 10-year review of his seminal 2010 analysis of health inequalities. “I have evidence to support that assertion,” he added. And he surely did. From stalled life expectancy – worsening for the poorest women – to growing numbers of children living in poverty, the University College London professor and unrivalled expert in inequalities research fired off a battery of data showing how England has grown more polarised by health in a decade. It was “highly likely” that austerity policies were the principal cause, he concluded, while in the rest of the UK “the damage to health and wellbeing is similarly unprecedented”.Less high profile, but equally concerning, was an report last week by the Office for National Statistics suggesting we are becoming a more fractured society: we have less “positive engagement” with neighbours, swapping favours or stopping to chat, and admit we are losing our sense of belonging to a neighbourhood we are doing less to help elderly or disabled people in the community and even to help our own parents or adult children and we are joining fewer clubs and societies, instead networking online from the isolation of our living rooms. Across 25 measures of “social capital”, many key indicators are alarmingly down.What can be done to reverse these widening health inequalities and the seeming loss of our (non-digital) social glue? How about, for starters, establishing a national centre where activists from some of the poorest communities could go to gain the confidence and skills to help their neighbours fight against social, financial and environmental social exclusion?As it happens, just such a centre was opened in 1995. More than 4,000 people have since attended Trafford Hall, near Chester, and benefited from its residential courses, taking back to their housing estates the wherewithal to challenge authority and – in the jargon – empower their friends and neighbours. But 12 months ago the centre suddenly closed, a victim of cashflow problems brought on by austerity cuts to the budgets of housing agencies and charities that funded the training. The 25 staff, who also hosted weddings and other revenue-earning events at the listed 18th-century former country house, were made redundant.Trafford Hall is an emblem of the story of public services over the past 30 years: conceived in the late 1980s in the social policy hothouse of the London School of Economics, and made real largely by the drive and determination of Anne Power, head of the LSE Housing and Communities research group, it thrived under the Blair and Brown Labour governments but benefited also from charitable and corporate support. Architect Richard Rogers was a committed supporter from the off, Prince Charles opened important doors and performed the opening ceremony, while Grand politan (now Diageo) bought the house and builders John Laing converted it at cost price.Poignantly, one of the last housing sector events held at Trafford Hall before its closure was organised to reflect on lessons of the 2017 Grenfell fire and to feed into the public inquiry into the tragedy. One of its conclusions was: “Tenants are entitled to have a voice in the safety, maintenance and general condition of their blocks. They often know more than staff about who lives in blocks, and about earlier works, as they have often been around longer than housing staff.”Hearing the voice of the UK’s 9 million social tenants will be a central and lasting message from the inquiry. And in Trafford Hall, ministers have a singular and symbolic opportunity to demonstrate that they intend not just to listen, but to help articulate and amplify that voice while at the same time building social capital and tackling inequalities. The National Communities Resource Centre, the charity behind Trafford Hall, hopes to reopen it this spring. It is still fundraising, and reckons to be about £70,000 short of what is needed in the first instance, but the government could ease the process immeasurably by pledging support. In the early 1990s, a Tory administration chipped in to help meet set-up costs at Trafford Hall. Today, its successors should do no less.• David Brindle is the ’s public services editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5719db0fb48601988056e0fa45857d149d8088c9/94_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6851ea9c1d2f8f69c19aec1ed6775b95","title":"england cricket the hundred 2030 the spin","story":"A decade after his predictions for 2020, Vic Marks looks at what might happen 10 years from now, including why Jimmy Anderson is unhappy with the vegan Duke ballsSir Andrew Strauss, chairman of the England Cricket Board, has delivered his annual report. He began by congratulating the England captain, Ollie Pope, on the team’s successful defence of the Ashes in Australia. The series finished level at 2-2 with the Sydney Test drawn. The outcome of each match was still in doubt at tea on the fifth day. The reversion to five-day Test cricket, which coincided with Colin Graves’s departure as chairman of the International Cricket Council, was deemed a success among the four countries still committed to playing Test cricket on a regular basis.Strauss expressed his gratitude to Pope and his red-ball coaching staff led by Richard Dawson, the former England off-spinner and Gloucestershire coach. He also highlighted the success of the one-day side, now overseen by Eoin Morgan, in the inaugural six-nation European Cup. England won the grand slam but he acknowledged there had been one or two well-publicised blips along the way and he thanked the minister for culture, media and sport, Edward Smith, for his assistance.When the England team arrived at the Scottish border without their passports it was only the minister’s intervention that allowed them to pass swiftly through customs and on to Edinburgh to fulfil the fixture. The ECB’s administrative staff ensured they avoided the same mistake on the way to the match against Wales in Cardiff. The Dutch side finished second in the table and, although without a victory, Italy showed signs of significant improvement. However, there was some frustration that the press facilities at their ground just outside of Siena were not big enough to accommodate a surprisingly large English media contingent.Victory in the European Cup consolidated the success of England’s second World Cup triumph in 2027 and the winning of the gold medal in the Los Angeles Olympics of 2028. Strauss also congratulated the women’s team on their silver medal in a T20 competition dominated yet again by the Australian “Invincibelles”.Strauss announced he had set up a cricket subcommittee led by Sir Moeen Ali. They have been discussing a variety of issues. One member, Jimmy Anderson, who is now England’s pace bowling consultant, has pointed out that his withdrawal from professional cricket in 2028 was hastened by the new vegan Duke cricket balls refusing to swing. In his view the game is diminished as a result.The committee was keen to discover the reasons for the delay in the completion of the South London Astrodome, which will allow short-form cricket to be played in England throughout the year. The issue of salary caps in county cricket was raised but soon dismissed when it became apparent Surrey was the only club with the resources to come anywhere close to the limits laid down by the ECB and the PCA.Looking ahead Strauss confirmed he would be in Sydney later in the year for the celebrations marking the centenary of the birth of Richie Benaud he said he would be attending the service of thanksgiving at Randwick, which is to be conducted by the Rev David Warner. Those expected to travel to Sydney for the occasion include prominent broadcasters Stuart Broad and Mark Wood. The MCC president, Ebony Rainford-Brent, will also be in attendance.Finally Strauss was upbeat about the domestic game in England. The 50-over competition, which was reinvigorated by the 2027 World Cup win, was won by Worcestershire at Trent Bridge. Meanwhile the Championship with its 12-team premier ision was won for the third time in five years by Somerset. The reduced second ision, comprising six semi-professional teams and only five four-day fixtures, was headed by Derbyshire, who now replace Leicestershire in the top ision.The traditional climax to the season, the Blast final, was another rip-roaring success played out in front of a sell-out crowd at Edgbaston. When Strauss was asked how anyone had ever entertained the idea that the Blast should be threatened or superseded by a competition called The Hundred at the start of the decade, he replied tersely: “I’m not here to talk about ancient history.” One of his aides was more forthcoming at the suggestion of revisiting the Hundred concept. “There’s more chance of getting shit from a rocking horse.”You may have spotted this contributor to the Spin is none too enamoured by the prospect of the Hundred. That remains the case but one announcement last week from the England and Wales Cricket Board’s unrelenting publicity machine prompted a rare – or should I say unprecedented? – nod of approval.My argument with the Hundred is not so much about the format. It stems more from the fact that the three prime months of the summer will, in essence, be devoted to short-form cricket. So any young cricketer with a brain will now hone his short-form skills long before anything else. The domestic schedule will become hopelessly unbalanced. However, I applaud the appointment of Moeen Ali as captain of the Birmingham-based team. Having him in charge may attract new fans in a manner way beyond an abundance of press releases, daft team names, inappropriate sponsors and a cacophony of fireworks.It is none of my business but I do fret about the current path of Moeen’s career. I like the idea of the best players being in the Test squad and if England were taking the strongest possible squad to Sri Lanka Moeen would be in it. The notion that Matt Parkinson will be of greater use is, of course, a nonsense. It seems a bad miscalculation not to have offered Moeen a Test contract on the realistic basis that there are no obvious alternatives out there. If necessary, maybe they could have erted some cash from the firework budget.The impetus to have Moeen in the side may be less obvious in the summer, depending upon how his replacements fare in Sri Lanka. So it is not guaranteed that he will return to Test cricket then especially since he is already committed to Indian Premier League cricket in April and now the Hundred come July and August. Moeen has 181 Test wickets. Among English spinners he might have gone past Jim Laker (193) by the end of the Sri Lanka tour with power (and wickets) to add in the summer of 2020. Joe Root and Chris Silverwood will regret his absence in Galle in less than a month’s time. I hope Moeen does not feel the same.“Obviously we’ll cross paths playing against each other, but I don’t have his number” – David Warner had no intention of clearing the air with Quinton de Kock before the Twenty20 series opener last week, following their stairwell clash during Australia’s last visit to South Africa in 2018.Melinda Farrell on the palpable sigh of relief in Australia as the Women’s T20 World Cup hosts survived a scare against Sri Lanka.

It is a breathtaking sight, a cacophonous celebration of life on a spectacular scale.While rural south-west Sweden is the kind of place one might visit in order to avoid the crowds, it is the masses that I have come to witness: the vast congregation of cranes that gather every year on the banks of Lake Hornborga during their long migration to rest and feed.More than that, they dance.Lake Hornborga lies north-east of Gothenburg and on arrival I waste no time in heading to the waterside from my accommodation in the nearby town of Falköping. I notice a few of the birds dotted about the fields as I approach the site but you don’t have to be a birdwatcher to spot this large, long-legged species. Towering up to 1.3 metres, they certainly stand out, with their elongated necks, black and white head stripes, grey plumage and bustle of feathers at the rear.Nothing quite prepares you for the main event, though, and turning off the road to the trandansen (crane dance) arena I am faced with an expanse of wetland and grassland covered in common cranes 19,500 of them to be precise, according to the daily count carried out by volunteers.Amid the giant flock, courting pairs dance, reaffirming potentially lifelong bonds with leaps and bows and bugle-blasts of noise. Their exuberant jumps and jerky neck thrusts might have a touch of dad-dancing about them but they are such elegant birds that they carry off the moves in style.“It’s a wonderful sight,” says bird guide Kent-Ove Hvass as we gaze out from the viewing point at the animated assembly a few metres away, fanning out around the bay and flying in from all directions. “And the more you watch them over the years the more you see how unique they all are.”The annual arrival of cranes begins in mid-March and has a special place in the hearts of Swedes as a sign of spring and longer days ahead – and it draws spectators from across the country and beyond. While it may well have occurred in this area for thousands of years, the birds have also been encouraged to visit because of the local production of brännvin: Swedish vodka.At one time potatoes were grown locally to create the spirit and migrating cranes gradually developed an appetite for unharvested tubers left in the ground. Their seasonal visits became such a popular sight that when the district distilleries shut down in the 1970s, the birds continued to be fed – which also helped prevent hungry flocks from raiding crops in neighbouring farmers’ fields.Today up to 150 tonnes of grain are spread beside Lake Hornborga during spring, helping the birds to refuel as they journey to breeding grounds in the far north. Their journey starts in Spain but many fly in from Rügen, northern Germany, another staging post, 430km away or a one-day flight. The greatest numbers tend to be seen in late Marchearly April, and when I visited last year a new record was set as the daily tally peaked at 27,300 cranes. By May they have departed on the final leg of their journeys but the lake is still a great place to see other waterfowl and raptors, such as marsh harrier, osprey, golden and white-tailed eagle.“Seeing the crane dance is on the bucket list for a lot of Swedes,” says Sofie Stålhand, Hornborga reserve centre manager. “And hopefully the experience inspires people to learn more about our nature and why it is worth protecting.”The area celebrates the influx of cranes with a week-long festival, and has other features of interest besides birdlife, including ancient standing stones at Ekornavallen and the fascinating Kata Gård Viking tombs unearthed on a hillside overlooking Varnhem Abbey. A museum and newly built centre at Varnhem tell the story of the excavation of one of Sweden’s oldest churches and life in the community down the centuries.There are a range of places to enjoy local food near Lake Hornborga, including historic hillside hotel and spa Kurorten Mössebergs (buffet lunch from £12, doubles from £140 B\u0026ampB) Löfwings Ateljé \u0026amp Krog (mains from £13, doubles from £107 B\u0026ampB), where you can browse wildlife art in an adjoining gallery Vilhelmsro Gårdscafe (doubles from £91 B\u0026ampB), a converted 19th-century dairy farm serving organic fare and Herrtorps Qvarn (doubles from £54 room only locally sourced, organic meals), a renovated riverside mill offering the opportunity to spot beavers in the wild. The giant cheese emporium Falbygdens Osteria, with 200 varieties to choose from, is also a flavoursome visit.During their five-week stay the cranes steal the show. Gawky and raucous at one moment, stately and serene the next, they are mesmerising to watch. Some people camp out near the site so they can savour the precious spectacle until the sun goes down, the birds head off to roost for the night, and the last dancer leaves the floor.• Read more about the cranes and the local area Flamingos in FranceThe vast Camargue wetland in southern France plays host to thousands of pairs of greater flamingos that nest among its briny lagoons every spring and summer, with guided tours available or the chance of close views at the bird park Pont de Gau.Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth (30 miles east of Edinburgh, off North Berwick coast) has the world’s largest gannet colony during spring and summer, when 150,000 of these large seabirds nest on the island’s cliffs.

The fallen titan of Hollywood, who was taken away in handcuffs, could face 25 years in prison and will have to register as a sex offender.Next, Weinstein is due to face a criminal case in LA, which stems from investigations by law enforcement in southern California into eight allegations.LA prosecutors have filed charges for two incidents that allegedly occurred within a two-day period. Those charges include forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint, carrying a potential 28-year prison sentence.It’s not yet clear how LA prosecutors plan to proceed following Monday’s verdict in New York. Weinstein could be immediately brought to California after his 11 March sentencing in New York. He could pursue a plea deal in LA after his guilty verdict in Manhattan, or he could end up facing a second trial, said Laurie Levenson, criminal law professor at Loyola Law School. Either way, it’s an uphill battle for the former movie producer, she said: “When he heads to LA, he’s already a convicted rapist.”The LA district attorney’s office declined to answer questions on Monday about the next steps in the case, but a spokesperson told the : “We are definitely proceeding.”In LA, Weinstein is accused of raping a woman at a hotel after pushing his way inside her room on 18 February 2013. Prosecutors said in court filings that Weinstein and the woman, who has not been publicly identified but has been described by her attorney as an Italian actor, had both attended a film festival that week. When Weinstein showed up at her hotel door, they “talked briefly” before the producer “attacked” her, according to the documents. He also faces allegations by Lauren Young, a 30-year-old model from Pennsylvania who has already provided an extensive account of her story as a witness in New York.Young told the jury in New York that a female acquaintance had invited her to the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills on 19 February 2013, and that she hoped to show Weinstein her film script.She said Weinstein asked the acquaintance and Young to go to his hotel room, where he led her into his suite and then the bathroom. Young alleged that the encounter became coercive and that as she entered the bathroom, the acquaintance closed the door behind her, leaving her with Weinstein. He allegedly turned the shower on and started undressing.“I stood there in shock. He was already naked at that point. He stepped in front of me when I went to approach the door with his naked body right in front of me. I felt so trapped,” she said.Young said Weinstein pushed her against the sink, unzipped and pulled down her dress, and groped her as he masturbated. She continued: “I said, ‘no, no, no’, the whole time … He’s carrying on with conversation: ‘This is what all actresses do, to make it.’”Despite her protests, Weinstein continued to masturbate until he ejaculated on to a towel, she said.Weinstein and his attorneys have continued to deny allegations of criminal offenses and have vowed to appeal the New York verdict.If women do testify in an LA trial, they will probably be subject to the same aggressive tactics that Weinstein’s defense team has deployed in New York. Donna Rotunno, Weinstein’s lead defense attorney, engaged in an intense character assassination of all six women who testified, accusing them of lying, having false memories and seeking money. She also repeatedly noted the women’s continued contact with Weinstein after the alleged attacks.Toward the end of the New York trial, Rotunno faced intense scrutiny for telling the New York Times she had never been sexually assaulted “because I would never put myself in that position”.Advocates for survivors of sexual violence and some of Weinstein’s accusers have slammed his lawyers’ strategies, arguing that the attorneys were perpetuating harmful tropes about sexual assault. Many have noted that it’s common for women to maintain relationships with perpetrators after the attacks.“The lawyers’ disgusting tactics to discredit and humiliate or try to humiliate the women and make it so that we are not believed, it’s awful,” the actor Rosanna Arquette, one of the first women to share details of Weinstein’s abuse in 2017, told the . “It exposes the difficulties women face when they come forward and tell the truth about their abusers.”Arquette, who rallied outside the New York courthouse at the start of the trial, said it seemed the brutal cross-examinations of the women were meant to intimidate others so they would not testify in LA or continue to speak out.“It is a scare tactic to shut women up, to stop further women from coming forward,” she said. “But we will always have the women’s backs … It’s not going to work.”Zoe Brock, a writer and designer from New Zealand who also spoke up about Weinstein in 2017, said the New York verdict signaled to Weinstein’s lawyers that they “can no longer victim-shame and blame and treat women on the stand as the guilty party and get away with it”, adding: “It proves you can be in a consensual relationship with someone and still be raped … that there is no perfect victim, that in the wake of trauma, we do complicated things.”Brock added that she was eager to see Weinstein face additional convictions in LA: “I hope every woman who suffered at the hands of Harvey Weinstein gets a rightful verdict, which is guilty, guilty guilty.”Wagatwe Wanjuki, an LA-based writer and anti-rape activist not involved in the case, said the trial and the treatment of women were another reminder that the criminal justice system was not well suited to address sexual violence and support survivors.“It really just highlights how hostile it is for victims. Weinstein doesn’t have to testify but the victims do, and they have to be blamed and detail really graphic details of really traumatic incidents,” she said. “This is why few rapists ever get arrested, very few are convicted, and even fewer go to jail … How do we move away from being dependent on a very traumatic process?”Arquette said that women would not stop speaking out, regardless of what happens: “We will continue to fight for truth and justice, and we are always going to be here supporting all women.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a222b38392aaae27e77664b9ce8d8636d59b466/0_207_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f6483c5a2778f297732807be3e14ad","title":"how have your travel plans been affected by the coronavirus","story":"We want to hear from those who have cancelled or rearranged travel plans due to the outbreakItaly and Iran have been forced to introduce travel restrictions due to major outbreaks in both countries.

It would expand the large settlement of Maale Adumim to in effect connect it with Jerusalem.Palestinians and their global backers argue the plan would virtually cut the West Bank into two enclaves and completely encircle Palestinian neighbourhoods in the holy city. It has long been seen as an impassable barrier to any viable future Palestinian state.“I have given instructions to immediately publish … the plan to build 3,500 housing units in E1,” Netanyahu said in a speech on Tuesday. “This had been delayed for six or seven years.”On Monday, Israelis will vote in a Knesset election in which the rightwing leader – the longest-serving in the country’s history – hopes to emerge victorious with backing from settlers and their supporters.He will need to win big to guarantee his political future. Two inconclusive elections in the past 12 months have resulted in stalemates, with neither Netanyahu nor his main rival, Benny Gantz, able to form a government.To rally his base, Netanyahu made similar expansionist pledges before both votes. In April, he said he would annex all current settlements, and in September, he promised to go further, by claiming sovereignty over a third of the entire West Bank.The US presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama both objected to the E1 plan. In 2012, Israel resurrected the idea as a retaliatory measure to the UN recognition of Palestine. That move was halted following a diplomatic crisis in which the UK, France, Sweden, Spain and Denmark summoned the respective Israeli ambassadors to their countries.It is unclear if there will be a similar response this time. Donald Trump’s administration has backed many of Israel’s claims to the Palestinian territories. While the UK government has repeated that settlements are illegal, it has also praised Trump’s intentions for the region."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/055010efde9f28c83d4468d9b51460a41c2ec541/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e3f3a3faa65f31f7cbdccd29a43015a","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms wuhan covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 13 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/728a8daf5c1ce78620f5269e4f8f7f57b4cc7ef4/0_34_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5acf4f85880f8e7d546ac89b07403a28","title":"rio carnival 2020 in pictures","story":"Brazil’s famed carnival kicked off in earnest on Saturday as millions of revellers poured into the streets, some of whom took aim at the nation’s deeply polarised politics.

Photograph: Brian ArthurThe Algerian government is to fund hundreds of PhD students to study at University of Limerick (UL) under a deal estimated to be worth up to €20 million.UL says the agreement is part of a move by Algeria to to move from French to English as the official language of teaching and learning in third level.Senior academics say the deal is a “game changing” one for UL which will boost the Irish university’s international presence and impact.The move will be supported through a specially designed PhD programme offered to visiting students at UL.Overall the programme will see 400 Algerian PhD students study at UL during the four years of the project.The first phase has seen 117 PhD students, the majority of whom are female, join the international PhD programme in Limerick.UL has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Algerian ministry of education agreeing to the relationship, as well as a contract guaranteeing €5.5 million for UL on the initial intake. This is set to rise to about €20 million over four years.Algeria has decided to change the official language of its higher education system from French to English to increase the visibility of research in its higher education institutions.The PhD was designed after a think tank of specialists and administration officials came together to find ways to open up the international environment for Algerian universities.Second languageProf Helen Kelly-Holmes, executive dean and chair in applied languages, said the initiative is a “game changer in terms of our international presence and impact”.“It builds on our strong reputation in the field of English as a second language, which is continually growing and innovating,” she said.“We have much to learn from the co-operation with Algeria and it is a fantastic opportunity to help shape the future development of higher education in that country.”Arezki Saidani, the Algerian ministry of education’s director of co-operation and interuniversity exchanges, said it looked forward to a “long-term engagement and fruitful collaboration with the University of Limerick”.The Algerian government has been exploring ways of moving from teaching everything through the medium of French to the medium of English in recent years, including how to upskill staff in higher education, trainee teachers and current students.UL’s first engagement with the proposal came through Prof Tewfik Soulimane, an Algerian national who is the head of chemical sciences at UL’s Bernal Institute. Pitch for projectA UL delegation later travelled to Algeria to pitch for the project and was successful.Dr Mairead Moriarty, assistant dean of arts, humanities and social sciences at UL, said its pitch included detailed presentations on how it would host the students, how the programme would look, the types of supports available for international students and how competitive UL was against other Irish and UK universities.“We were told that they needed to start the switch and publish in English and to ensure that their education system is moved over to English quickly,” she said.“Our job now is to bring students, who have competed nationally in Algeria for these scholarships, over to us so that they can be trained on how to teach through the medium of English while also doing a PhD at the same time.”The project team in UL created an international PhD with a taught component of English as a medium of instruction, after which candidates will embark on three years of inidual research resulting in a PhD upon completion.On completion, it says each of the Algerian students will be well-placed to access a lecturing post when they return home.Dr Moriarty said the programme has the potential to provide a significant economic boost for both iniduals and the Algerian economy.“Also the majority of the students are female and if you are putting women in that role of train the trainer, where society is traditionally male-dominated, that is a really strong statement made by government,” she added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183715.1582578713!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"graduates not well equipped for future workplace","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe same study also polled the opinions of more than 600 teachers, parents of secondary school pupils and young adults.Just 13 per cent of employers believe graduates are very well equipped to meet the needs of the future workforce, according to a new survey.Employers say “soft” skills such as communication, work ethic, teamwork and problem-solving will be most needed for the workforce of the future over the coming years.The findings are based on research by Accenture involving 130 employers in Ireland over recent months.The same study also polled the opinions of more than 600 teachers, parents of secondary school pupils and young adults.Overall, it found that education and businesses are at odds over how prepared students are for the working world. Accenture’s Learning to Lead report found that while 66 per cent of teachers think students are equipped, some 42 percent of employers think the opposite.In addition, only 23 percent of employers think the education sector is keeping pace with industry needs. According to the report, the speed and direction of travel in education is an issue for around half of companies. Inside schools, sentiments are similar with students and teachers painting a picture of a second level education system struggling to keep up with the needs of the working world.The report explores how well prepared we are for the changing world of work, as well as the hurdles businesses in Ireland are confronted with today that must be addressed if they are to access a talent pool that can help them innovate and grow. Alastair Blair, country managing director at Accenture in Ireland, said if we want Ireland to continue to provide a talent pool for the innovative companies based here, as well as improve the prospects of home-grown businesses, we must think hard about what they will need.“We have a good education system in Ireland but, according to our report, there are challenges earlier in the education journey - particularly at second level - where the focus is more on aptitude than attitude,” he said.“ This is more than just a research announcement - it’s a call to action for a stronger approach to how government, business and education can work together to shape a society in Ireland fit for the opportunities of tomorrow.”Among students, the report highlights a disconnect between the skills 16-25 year olds believe they will need and what they are taught in the classroom. Only 27 percent feel very prepared for the roles of the future, with 22 percent claiming not to feel prepared at all.The report says this may reflect understandable uncertainty about what future jobs will look like. Most teachers are also concerned that roles and the industries some students want to work in will be obsolete in the future.In fact, almost two thirds of teachers believe that the way subjects are taughtin school equips students adequately for the working world.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing.

The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4184270.1582627343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu uk deal depends on enforcing irish sea border simon coveney says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe agreement of a future trade relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom depends on the implementation of an Irish Sea border and this must begin within months, Tánaiste and foreign minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday.“I think it’s important to put markers down at this early stage. What has already been agreed in an international treaty needs to be implemented in full,” Mr Coveney said as he entered talks in Brussels to sign off on the EU’s negotiating guidelines for the next phase of Brexit talks.“If there isn’t progress on the infrastructure needed to implement the Irish protocol as part of the withdrawal agreement in the next few months then I think that is going to be a very worrying signal for whether or not it’s going to be possible to conclude something sensible for the end of the year.”The government of British prime minister Boris Johnson indicated in recent days it would not enforce the checks and controls between Britain and Northern Ireland that were agreed in the first part of Brexit negotiations last year.Along with delicate issues such as territorial fishing rights, the Irish Sea border threatens to once again be a stumbling block in negotiations ahead. The Irish government has been keen to stress its solidarity with chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who held a morning meeting with Mr Coveney and Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee before the gathering of EU ministers convened.Under the so-called Irish Protocol agreed as part of Britain’s withdrawal agreement from the EU, Northern Ireland is to remain in line with the EU rules required to avoid a hardened border across the island. As the island of Britain is exempt, this entails that checks must take place between the islands, the extent of which depend on the future relationship deal and how much Britain erges from EU norms when it exits its transition period at the end of this year. Without a deal by then, onerous tariffs and customs requirements will automatically come into force between Britain and Ireland (and the rest of the EU), with potentially grave consequences for the Irish economy.Mr Coveney warned that the UK would be wrong to think it could negotiate the extent of checks with technical committees set up to identify the technicalities of how the Irish Sea border checks should be enforced.“The withdrawal agreement involves significant commitments in the context of Northern Ireland through the Irish Protocol that both the EU and the UK need to follow through on,” Mr Coveney said. “If that doesn’t happen, then I think it will damage significantly the prospects of being able to get even a bare bones trade agreement.”EU member states are set to formally sign off on the negotiating mandate for the future relationship talks on Tuesday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

He said  any viable coalition would need ‘around 85-plus’ votes in the Dáil to provide stable government. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.Green Party TDs met Sinn Féin representatives on Monday for preliminary talks about possiblly forming a government, as a week of negotiations between the parties got underway at Leinster House. The Greens have scheduled further talks with Sinn Féin for Tuesday in addition to two days of discussions with Fianna Fáil on Wednesday and Thursday. Party leader Eamon Ryan said he also expected to meet Fine Gael and the Social Democrats before the Dáil reconvenes next week for further votes on who would be the next taoiseach. Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is to meet Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on Tuesday to discuss the options for government formation. Fianna Fáil representatives are meeting Independent TDs this week, with Kerry independent Michael Healy-Rae confirming earlier that he and his brother, Danny, and other rural deputies would hold talks with Mr Martin on Tuesday. “This is very welcome as the people want to see their politicians working and talking, to try and put together a programme for Government in order to provide stability for the country,” Mr Healy-Rae said in a tweet. However, sources in all parties say these talks are at an early stage and few in Leinster House expect a breakthrough in time for the Dáil’s next meeting on Thursday of next week. Assist Mr Ryan described the two hours of talks with Sinn Féin as “exploratory” and said he hoped they would assist in future negotiations on a programme for government, which could involve more parties.“Hopefully it’ll help us to set off on the right path,” he said. Asked if he would be in a position to offer Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald his party’s support in the next round of voting on a potential taoiseach, Mr Ryan said the Greens were “not ruling anything out”. However, he said it was not in the gift of the party to make that option “viable”. He said that any viable coalition would need “around 85-plus” votes in the Dáil to provide stable government. A bare majority in the House is 80 TDs. Sinn Féin has 37 TDs following the February 8th election, the same number as Fianna Fáil after it saw Kildare South TD Seán Ó Fearghaíl re-elected as Ceann Comhairle last week. Fine Gael has 35 TDs, Independents and others account for 21 seats with the Greens holding 12 seats, Labour and the Social Democrats both have six TDs and Solidarity-People Before Profit have five. Mr Ryan acknowledged that achieving the 85-plus number would require the support of two of the big three parties, but added that the Greens had not ruled out supporting a minority government. “But it’s very hard to see how it would work on the current numbers. But that doesn’t stop us from talking to Sinn Féin,” he said, adding that the Greens would treat all other parties the same way.Coming togetherHe said that the formation of a government would require a further round of talks, which he hoped would involve several parties coming together. Mr Ryan declined to be drawn into the row between Mr Varadkar and Sinn Féin over a series of rallies planned by the party to press its case for inclusion in the next government. “I don’t disagree with the need to bring your people and your members with you. We’ll be doing something similar. We’ll probably hold not just meeting but probably a couple of meetings with our members to get their view, and to make sure they’re informed,” Mr Ryan said. “So rather than criticising other parties, I’d prefer to concentrate on our own work, our own messaging to our members and the people who voted for us.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183750.1582581503!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mcdonald says sf meetings not an affront to democracy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader  Mary Lou McDonald: “I think it’s much healthier to involve people, to report back to them, to take people’s questions, to listen to them, to listen to people’s ideas.” Photograph:  Michael Mac SweeneyProvisionSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said the idea that public meetings held by her party are “an affront to democracy” is “ridiculous”.An estimated 700 people attended a Sinn Féin meeting on Monday evening in the Rochestown Park Hotel, Cork, with another meeting due to take place in Dublin’s Liberty Hall on Tuesday. Others will be held at venues across the country in the coming weeks.Other parties have criticised Sinn Féin holding the meetings, with Taoiseach and Fine Gael Leo Varadkar saying it was an example of Sinn Féin’s “campaign of intimidation and bullying”. Fianna Fáil TD Darragh O’Brien said the meeting was “right out of the Trump playbook”. Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Ms McDonald said Mr Varadkar’s “comments were completely over the top”, and she accused the Taoiseach of “hysterical overreaction”. “It is obvious that the political establishment are struggling with the result of the election. “I think for any reasonable or sensible person, the suggestion that holding public meetings is somehow an affront to democracy is just ridiculous.“You see, I don’t think it is wise that the election happens, people cast their vote and politicians disappear behind high walls and have discussions and leave people out. “I think it’s much healthier to involve people, to report back to them, to take people’s questions, to listen to them, to listen to people’s ideas.”The Cork meeting, which lasted for an hour and a half, was addressed by Ms McDonald, and was followed by a question-and-answer session with the party leader, housing spokesman Eoin O’Broin, public expenditure spokesman David Cullinane and finance spokesman Pearse Doherty.Questions were asked about issues such as childcare, housing, mental health, disability services, Irish unity and the eligibility age for the State pension.Ms McDonald criticised Mr Varadkar but particularly Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin. She raised Mr Martin’s decision not to talk to Sinn Féin about government formation, saying: “I hope the leader of Fianna Fáil changes his position but he may not.”Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin are due to hold exploratory talks on a potential future coalition between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, as well as other parties and Independents, on Tuesday. Ms McDonald said that, in contrast to his decision not to talk to Sinn Féin, Mr Martin’s “eagerness to run into the arms of Fine Gael is lost on no one”. She said the “first item” between Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar “is who should be taoiseach”. Mr Doherty told the meeting that more than 3,000 people had joined Sinn Féin in the last three weeks, adding that a further 4,000 new members were currently being processed. Role of taoiseachAlso present at the meeting was Solidarity Cork North Central TD Mick Barry, who was one of eight non-Sinn Féin TDs who supported Ms McDonald’s candidacy for the taoiseach’s position in the Dáil last week. The Dáil failed to elect a taoiseach at its first sitting since the general election. Ms McDonald won 45 votes, Mr Martin 41, Mr Varadkar 36 and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan 12. Mr Barry also criticised the comments made by Mr Varadkar, saying the rights of free speech and the right to assemble in public gatherings were essential elements of democracy. “The only intimidation and bullying I see, Leo Varadkar, is from a frightened establishment,” Mr Barry said. However, he once again told Ms McDonald he will withdraw his support for her if she attempts to form a government with Fianna Fáil. “When I cast my vote I was casting my vote for a government that excluded the parties . . . of the vested interests,” he said, claiming these parties were Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. “You will not hold on to my support if you agree to do a deal with Fianna Fáil,” Mr Barry told Ms McDonald.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183631.1582571857!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"timmy dooley secures nomination to contest seanad election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer Fianna Fáil TD for Clare Timmy Dooley will contest the upcoming Seanad election.

The deadline for these nominations is March 2nd.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will make their final decision on candidates this week with a large number of former TDs in the mix.Sixteen Fianna Fáil TDs lost their seats and the names mentioned so far as would-be Seanad candidates include former Mayo TD Lisa Chambers and former Kildare South TD Fiona O’Loughlin.Twelve Fine Gael TDs lost their seats including Minister of State Seán Kyne, whom the Taoiseach nominated to the Seanad for its remaining few weeks to succeed Frank Feighan, who won a Dáil seat.Fine Gael is focused on securing seats where it has no Dáil representation including Dublin North-West, where Noel Rock lost his seat, Carlow, where Pat Deering lost his seat but has an outside Seanad nomination, Waterford and Tipperary.

Photograph: Gabriel KuchtaGettySlovakia stands at a political crossroads ahead of Saturday’s parliamentary election, and its beleaguered Roma minority is being urged to mobilise to help prevent a turn to the extreme right.Roma activists and politicians are calling on their ethnic kin to break with a tradition of poor turnout and vote in record numbers, and they have persuaded seven of the country’s parties to commit to pursuing anti-discrimination reforms in the new parliament.Up to 10 per cent of Slovakia’s 5.4 million people are Roma, but many live in penury on the margins of society, making them an easy target for extremists and even for a ruling party that is using nationalist rhetoric in its bid to retain power.Polls suggest the governing Smer (Direction) party will win the election by only a narrow margin, fuelling speculation that it could join forces with followers of ultra-nationalist Marian Kotleba.The former schoolteacher, who has praised Slovakia’s wartime Nazi puppet state and marched in black uniform similar to that worn by its troops, came to international attention when he was elected as a regional governor in 2013.He lost the post four years later but his People’s Party Our Slovakia (LSNS) remains a force, taking 12 per cent in last year’s European elections and now looking to improve on the 8 per cent it won in the 2016 national ballot. Surveys show the party could take more than 10 per cent on Saturday.“The worst outcome would be Kotleba doing well and somehow going into government with Smer,” says Eugen Radic, mayor of the village of Martinova in central Slovakia.Both men are from a Roma minority which, particularly in eastern Slovakia, still has poor access to education, housing, the job market and healthcare some schools are segregated, driving an early wedge between Roma and ethnic Slovaks.‘Parasites’ labelKotleba has called Roma “parasites” and his party echoes other far-right movements in the region by vowing to “bring order” to mostly Roma districts that they depict as dens of crime and filth.Slovakia’s supreme court last year rejected a bid to outlaw Kotleba’s party, but he still faces extremism charges for using a 2017 charity event to give poor families cheques for €1,488 – a figure with symbolic significance for neo-Nazis.Some observers say the LSNS has toned down its aggressive anti-Roma rhetoric recently to boost its electability, focusing instead on perceived threats from the EU and a “liberal elite” that is supposedly out of touch with the “real Slovakia”.But the threat they pose has not gone away, warns Bari, the Radnovce mayor.“I’m very afraid that if they gain power there will be far more serious problems in the villages,” he says. “Many Roma say that if Kotleba gets into power they will leave Slovakia.”Smer has also helped bring anti-Roma prejudice into the political mainstream: when LSNS deputy Milan Mazurek was fined by the supreme court last year for deriding “Gypsy anti-socials” and comparing Roma children to “animals in a zoo”, Smer leader Robert Fico defended him.“Milan Mazurek said what almost the whole nation thinks and if you execute someone for the truth, you turn him into a national hero,” Fico wrote on Facebook, adding that the police could “enter any pub in Slovakia and lock up all the patrons” for saying similar things.When prosecutors charged Fico with inciting racial hatred, Smer deputies rallied behind a man who served for 10 years as Slovakia’s prime minister between 2006 and 2018.Murdered journalist“If he’s going to be indicted, then so should we, because we agree with him,” they said. The charges against Fico were dropped last month.Fico resigned in 2018 after the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his girlfriend Martina Kusnirova, which sparked a political crisis that has knocked support for Smer down to about 17 per cent, according to surveys.Recent polls put the centrist Olano party in second place and the LSNS in third, followed by four liberal and conservative opposition groups which, if they were able to overcome ideological differences, could form a majority coalition government.One of those groups, the Progressive Slovakia-Together alliance, won Slovakia’s European elections and saw its presidential candidate Zuzana Caputova beat her Smer rival to become head of state last March.“On the day she became president, she said thank you in all the languages of Slovakia, including the Roma language,” says Viktor Teru, country facilitator for the Roma Education Fund in Slovakia and a personal adviser to Caputova. “This was her first message to society – that she is president for everyone.”As president, the lawyer and former environmental activist is a strong counterweight to populism and nationalism in Slovak politics, but it is unclear whether a fractious opposition can unite to oust Smer and keep Kotleba at bay.Smer and the LSNS were not among seven parties that signed a memorandum on Saturday condemning hate speech and pledging to pursue reforms to improve education, healthcare and employment prospects for Roma.“We want Roma voices to reach the political parties, and for there to be dialogue about the demands coming from the Roma community,” says Csaba Horvath, director of the Opre Roma NGO that led the memorandum initiative.“We want to mobilise the community because we are afraid of Kotleba’s party and we know that they are mobilising. We want to say that we are here, we oppose extremism and we are part of Slovakia,” he told The .“We see extremist tendencies and negative attitudes towards Roma getting stronger in the region. That’s why this election is so important – to stop Slovakia going in the same direction.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: UK\u0026#39s negotiating mandate for trade talks approved ahead of discussions next weekCoronavirus latest news: British private school closes after ski trip to ItalySensors installed in rivers to monitor water levels stopped working because of sheer volume of flooding, Environment Agency boss admits St David\u0026#39s Day 2020: Welsh traditions, medieval miracles and how leeks became an iconic symbolAustralia\u0026#39s spy agency has warned that the threat of terrorism is \u0026#39unnaceptably high\u0026#39\u0026#39There was no Westminster VIP child sex abuse ring\u0026#39, concludes inquiryNew Tory MP apologises after video of him flashing genitals to women in pub emerges Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian president ousted in Arab Spring, dies at 91Tenerife hotel with 1,000 guests in lockdown after Italian tests positive for coronavirusNorth Korea quarantines hundreds of foreigners in anti-virus sweepHS2-linked college failed to protect apprentices from harassment, report revealsHarvey Weinstein found guilty of rape in watershed trialHarvey Weinstein taken to hospital on way to prison after rape convictionSpanish opera star Placido Domingo apologises to women after harassment claimsCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world The Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayOutgoing head of MI5 says lack of regulation on \u0026#39wild west\u0026#39 web is \u0026#39mystifying\u0026#39White House calls for $2.5bn urgent coronavirus fundingTuesday morning news briefing: Shaming of WeinsteinComment: Why become a landlord if you can never evict your tenants?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/24/TELEMMGLPICT000224416170_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwYwaSr0e9cnkDd74pj-NCg4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"become landlord can never evict tenants","story":"Changes in the law intended to benefit tenants will only make things worse if they discourage others from letting propertyWhy do people let houses? Because they hope to make money by doing so. In most circumstances, the profits are not large, because the costs are high, but it is worth doing because the house owned is a store of value and a hedge against inflation. What will landlords do if the opportunity for profit disappears? They will stop offering houses for rent if they possibly can. New landlords will not come forward to replace them.Yet the Government is toying with the idea of getting rid of Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Property Act. This section allows a landlord to ask a sitting tenant to quit at the end of an agreed period. If it is abolished, so that no notice to quit can ever be issued to a tenant, the incentive to let disappears. The value of the property thus encumbered drops, sometimes halves. Besides, sitting tenancies require rent controls to work, so the landlord will be stuck, not only with the tenant, but with every prospect of lower returns as time passes.The effect on small-scale landlords, most of them natural Tories, could be dire. Would their mortgages any longer meet the banks’ loan-to-value criteria? What would happen to them if the banks demanded repayment? Similar damage would be done to the small builders who look after such properties and are just the sort of aspirant, practical people the country needs.Poorer people certainly suffer greatly from the housing shortage. If it could be shown that sitting tenancies would increase the number of cheap rented homes, then a price to landlords might be worth paying. But in fact the opposite is the case. An unmovable tenant creates, over time, an unworkable business. Some ministers may see this as “levelling up”. Actually, it is more like closing down.The likes of David Dimbleby can be expected to stand up for the BBC, but his views do not necessarily accord with those of the publicWhen vested interests defend themselves, they love preposterous exaggeration. More than 30 years ago, the Government introduced a modest reform which would allow solicitors the same “rights of audience” as barristers. The then Lord Chief Justice described the green paper on the reforms as “one of the most sinister documents ever to emanate from government”. I still laugh whenever I remember this.The distinguished, recently retired broadcaster David Dimbleby describes the present Government’s idea of decriminalising non-payment of the BBC licence fee as “pernicious”. Again, one can only laugh.There are some respectable arguments for the licence fee, but is there any other poll tax bearing most heavily on the poorest and bringing roughly 200,000 people a year before the courts against which Mr Dimbleby thinks it would be “pernicious” to campaign?The Dimblebys earned a regular living from the BBC from 1936, when David’s famous father Richard joined, until last year, when David stood down from Question Time and his brother Jonathan from Any Questions? All three were very good at their jobs. To them, it must be axiomatic that the BBC is so virtuous that refusing to pay for it is a criminal offence. For growing millions, however, that logic is elusive.The Confederation of British Industry – the CBI – is another vested interest which, like the BBC, seemed to lose its reason, and certainly its fairness, during the Brexit wars. Yesterday, its director-general, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, reluctantly admitted that she had not been invited to the Prime Minister’s Brexit trade speech at Greenwich on February 3.Dame Carolyn is polite these days, trying to get her organisation back in the game. But before the general election she was vehement and highly political, first against Brexit, then against no deal, and also against Boris Johnson, stating that the CBI viewed his premiership (before he had attained it) with “deep concern”.The CBI is an important industry body, entitled to its voice but such bodies cannot expect to be close to government policy if they have pitted themselves against the main aims and personnel of that government.Dame Carolyn and her followers are like the trade union barons after Mrs Thatcher came into office in May 1979. The union leaders had tried to run the country before, and they had failed. Mrs Thatcher therefore stopped the custom of giving them “beer and sandwiches at Number Ten”.Over the weekend, two groups of very different persuasions have come to similar conclusions about carbon net zero by 2050, to which the Government is committed. The Global Warming Policy Foundation (on whose board I sit) is sceptical about many policy prescriptions to halt climate change. The Green New Deal Group is run by Leftists and Greens who want to “pull the world back from economic and environmental meltdown”. But they are close to agreement on costs. The GWPF’s new study puts the figures at £100 billion per year (on average) between now and 2050. The Green New Deal agrees on the £100 billion per year figure, but projects that cost over only 20 years.The sum of £100 billion is more than our entire annual spending on education and is two and a half times our annual defence budget. Yet the advisory Committee on Climate Change calls the cost “manageable” and avoids trying to work it out accurately.Whatever your view, isn’t it time the Government admitted the scale of spending and tried to explain why it is needed and how it will be paid for?The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It was flatlining because the river had risen above the electrics running the gauge and overwhelmed the hardware.He said the sensors will have to be replaced once lives and property have been protected from the floods.Sir James added: We replace the sensors all the time, you do need to invest in the hardware, you need to constantly be developing the technology so it will work better.In every flood there will be things that don\u0027t work properly, that\u0027s the nature of floods, they destroy some of our own assets, so what we are doing right now is focusing on the immediate response to protect lives and property, as soon as that\u0027s over we will be in a programme of recovery where we will start to assess the damage that is done, make repairs to the flood defences and to the equipment that we use and we will do that as quickly as possible.Britain will need £1 billion a year for flood defences alone, he added, with more money required to fix homes and businesses. Currently, the government manifesto plan is to provide £4bn for 5 years.18 gauges across 15 rivers had recorded their highest water levels, including the Colne, Ribble, Calder, Aire, Trent, Severn, Wye, Lugg and Derwent.Floods are continuing to cause misery across the country. In Shrewsbury many schools and businesses have closed, including the town\u0027s three shopping centres after the underground carparks flooded.In Ironbridge, 40 people were evacuated and police warned there was a strong chance the temporary flood barriers would be breached.Wales, where more than 1,000 homes have already been evacuated, is likely to face more flooding, with Thursday\u0027s predicted rain set to cause snow on the mountains to melt, adding more water.Britain faces ice and snow over the next 24 hours, before rain hits on Thursday. On Monday night, the mercury dropped to minus 4.5C at the Cairnwell in the Scottish Highlands, the Met Office said.Higher areas in Ireland, Scotland and northern England were expected to continue to receive snow throughout the day, Mr Griffiths said.Two severe danger to life flood warnings have been issued by the Environment Agency for the Shropshire towns of Shrewsbury and Ironbridge, along the River Severn.A further 110 flood warnings - where flooding is expected - and 201 flood alerts - where flooding is possible - were in place across England on Tuesday night.The Met Office has warned drivers of blustery showers, with the possibility of ice, sleet and snow during rush hour.Caroline Douglass, Director of Incident Management at the Environment Agency said: “Our thoughts are with all who have been and continue to be affected by the persistent and extreme weather. It is devastating to see your home or business flooded, and as the case is for some, be asked to evacuate.“We are in our fourth week of exceptional river levels and stormy weather with the effects of climate change, we need to prepare for more frequent periods of extreme weather like this.

The current budget in the fiscal year so far was in deficit by £7.2bn.Under the fiscal rules set by former chancellor Sajid Javid, who resigned earlier this month, the government must balance the current budget over three years, although borrowing for infrastructure is allowed up 3 per cent of GDP, which would allow an extra £22bn of public sector net investment a year.“While the current fiscal rule, would still allow a large rise in public investment, the rise in the deficit makes the ambition of balancing the current budget deficit more restrictive,” said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at analysts Capital Economics.Mr Sunak said this week he would stick with the 11 March date for the government’s first post-Brexit Budget, ending speculation that the plans, which are likely to entail a big increase in spending, would be delayed.Philip Shaw, the chief UK economist at Investec, said the critical factor for next month’s Budget would be how much fiscal headroom there was to raise spending further beyond the plan for 2020-21 that Mr Javid set out last September.“The Conservatives’ manifesto committed the party to balancing the current budget during this parliament,” he\u0026nbspsaid.Mr Shaw added\u0026nbspthat how much room Mr Sunak had depended on precisely how this was defined, for example, which specific year in the parliament was used.“Our guess is that although there will not be much space for fiscal generosity, the chancellor will find some,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And those quakes could shed important new light on how Mars came to be formed, as well as the rest of the Solar System.Other findings from the InSight spacecraft show that the Martian magnetic field is ten times stronger than expected.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInSight landed on Mars in November 2018, after a journey that saw it travel 300 million miles over a period of nearly seven months. Since then, it has been examining what exists underneath the Martian surface.Dr Bruce Barnerdt, InSight principal investigator and lead author on one of the studies, said: We finally have, for the first time, established that Mars is a seismically active planet.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

That will last for three days, and the forum will return to normal on 5 March.It is not the first time that the authors on rnosleep have attempted to fight back against the use of their stories without permission. Almost two years ago, a No Sleep Writers Guild was established, which attempted to make it easier for authors to license and sell their stories, and to protect their legal rights when stories were being stolen.Online horror forums have often had a relatively permissive approach to the use of stories and other content, with many of the earliest and most famous examples being circulated through copypasta, where text would be copy and pasted across different parts of the internet. The new protests come as authors attempt to stop such re-use, and ensure that they are properly credited and rewarded for their work.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a flash, we had profound new information on the Iron Age Middle East,” said Dr Osborne, who specialises in examining the expression of political authority in Iron Age cities.\u0026nbspHe said it was “a marvellous, incredibly lucky find”.The Oriental Institute’s linguistic analysis suggested the engravings was made in the late-eighth-century BC, which lines up with the time Midas ruled.\u0026nbspThe stone also provides answers for a long-standing mystery: Less than 10 miles to the south of the ancient city is a volcano with a well-known inscription in hieroglyphics. It refers to a King Hartapu, but no one knew who he was – or what kingdom he ruled.University of Chicago\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She also thanked staff previously living in the quarantine accommodation blocks for their patience while they stay in nearby hotels.“We are following all the new local and regional guidance on managing this group of residents for the period that they are with us and we have got a significant number of health professionals working alongside us both outside and inside the building,” she said.“I just wanted to say too that for all the local residents and patients that use our services, the hospital is still open.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The FCO worked hard to get them back to the UK securely.“Our number one priority has consistently been the health and safety of UK nationals.”The four Britons on board the Diamond Princess who have recently tested positive for coronavirus were not on the flight.One couple, Sally and David Abel, from Northamptonshire, were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary.Since being diagnosed with the coronavirus, they have both contracted pneumonia. While originally taken to a “lovely hospital”, their family said they have now been moved to a “prison”-like hospital.While stuck onboard the ship, Mr Abel, who identifies as a “staunch Tory”, criticised Boris Johnson’s response to the crisis, saying\u0026nbsphe had “no confidence”\u0026nbspin the prime minister.Around the world, more cases and deaths have been reported, including the second coronavirus patient to die in Italy after a patient succumbed to the virus on Friday night.Britons evacuated from Japan after weeks on quarantined cruise shipCoronavirus: FBI stockpiles hand sanitiser to prepare for pandemicTime running out to stop global spread of coronavirus – WHO warnsCoronavirus cuts China’s greenhouse gas emissions by a quarterItaly’s Ansa news agency cited healthcare sources in confirming the second death on Saturday.South Korea’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than double the number of cases in the country since Friday to 433.The surge in cases, which has made it the largest cluster outside mainland China, was believed to originate from a 61-year-old woman who attended four services in a religious sect before testing positive for the virus.In Iran, health authorities confirmed\u0026nbspa fifth death from the virus on Saturday and said the fataility was from 10 newly confirmed cases.Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, who made the announcement on state TV, said two of the newly detected cases were found in the capital of Tehran and the other eight were in the city of Qom.The World Health Organisation’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday it was concerned about the number of coronavirus cases with no clear epidemiological link.Cases without clear links include those with no travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case, he told a briefing.He also called the reported decline in new cases in China welcome news but urged caution, adding: “It is far too early to make predictions about this outbreak.“Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I want to be brave like you.”He then invited Zachary onto the stage, where he offered him encouragement and advice. Reflecting on his own experience, Mr Buttigieg told him:Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It took me a long time to figure out how to tell even my best friend that I was gay, let alone to go out there and tell the world.“And to see you willing to come to terms with who you are in a room full of 1,000 people, thousands of people you’ve never met, that’s really something.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jessica Canicosa, a precinct captain for Bernie Sanders, waits to greet caucus voters at Liberty High School in Henderson, NevadaA supporter of Amy Klobuchar in Las Vegas, NevadaHotel workers at the Bellagio in Las Vegas get to grips with voting papers during the Nevada caucusesMichael J Fox –\u0026nbspthe Back to the Future actor turned activist –\u0026nbspspeaks at a rally for Pete Buttigieg at Faiss Middle School in Las VegasVoters at a campaign event for Amy Klobuchar in Reno, NevadaA caricature of Bernie Sanders is projected on to a tree during a rally in Las VegasA woman waits to have a photo taken with Elizabeth Warren during a town hall meeting in Las VegasThe threat of coronavirus and other germ-borne illnesses was on some voters\u0027 minds at the Democratic caucuses in Henderson, NevadaFormer vice-president Joe Biden takes a selfie with a voter in Las Vegas ahead of the Nevada caucusesA member of Mike Bloomberg\u0027s election team in a campaign office in New York CityAmy Klobuchar changes her shoes backstage after giving a speech in Exeter, New HampshireA warmly-wrapped-up dog attends an Elizabeth Warren event at Amherst Elementary School in Nashua, New HampshireBernie Sanders, who romped to victory in New Hampshire against Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks to the media in ManchesterLisa Olney, of Wellesley, Massachussets, demonstrates her support for Elizabeth Warren in Nashua, New HampshireJoe Biden was hoping to improve on his poor showing in Iowa in the New Hampshire primaryElizabeth Warren, renowned for giving time to supporters for selfies, works the crowd at the University of New Hampshire in DurhamJoe Biden takes a selfie with a supporter and his child outside a campaign event in Somersworth, New Hampshire on 5 FebruaryElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders quarrel after a confrontation in a TV debate in which Sanders claimed that Warren was not telling the truth about a conversation in which she claimed he had said a woman could not win the presidency on 14 JanuarySupporter Pat Provencher listens to Pete Buttigieg in Laconia, New Hampshire on 4 FebruaryElizabeth Warren jogs away after speaking to reporters during a campaign event in Nashau, New HampshireSupporters of Amy Klobuchar gather before a rally.

But its simple for users to lie about their age.Last year an NSPCC report found that the  was responsible for six recorded cases of child sex and child abuse images offences.Now disgusted parents have told the Sun Online how their children have been sent explicit, inappropriate and threatening messages from strangers on the app.Thats why we launched our TikTok Time Bomb series - to raise awareness of the risks and urge the site to be better moderated so kids arent left to protect themselves online.Worried parent Nigel Wharton said: I checked my  year old sons account and found five private messages from adults...one telling him they love him.Mum-of-two Robyn Ganley, from Sunderland, was furious when she found a stranger had liked all her ten-year-old daughter Kais photos and commented on them saying wow.She told the Sun Online: I just happened to go through her phone that day and found it.It wasnt any of her friends contacting her, it was someone she didnt know. I reported the account.I was furious when I saw it. I deleted the app, but she re-downloaded it.I hate the app. It really frightens me as a parent how easy it is for people to contact my kids on there.A mum-of-one, from Bradford, who we have chosen not to name, was appalled by what she discovered on her ten-year-old nieces phone.She told the Sun Online: Debbie* was watching another childs live video when a private profile who had no picture started chatting to her via the live comments of the other childs video.This person kept asking personal questions and then proceeded to ask hershe had ever rubbed her private parts. I felt sick to my stomach.The police were called and an officer came to see Debbie.It’s become a magnet for paedophiles as well as a hotbed for violent and extremist content, with TikTok predators exploiting the s young user base and lax security to prey on the vulnerable.Weve seen kids as young as eight being groomed on TikTok, while other creeps take advantage of young girls posting sexualised content of themselves on the .And thats especially worrying on a site which is attracting millions more children every year, with  per cent of kids now owning a smartphone by the age of seven.Thats why we launched our TikTok Time Bomb series — to make sure parents are aware of the risks their kids are being exposed to, and what they can do to better protect them. Everyone agrees social media can be a force for good, but it has to be used the right way and with proper controls in place.We want TikTok to better moderate its content so that it’s not being left to kids to protect themselves online. They informed the family that there had been a lot of calls about similar incidents, where someone with a private profile without a photo had been sending vile messages to children.The mum added: What a lot of parents dont realise is that eventheir child has their account set to private, people can still contact them through comments on another childs video or through comments on another persons live video.The site is definitely not good for young children. Theres some really young people using it and its scary.The police talked to Debbie about the incident, online safety and the dangers of using TikTok.However, while they took the name of the private account, the family said they couldnt track who it was behind the profile.They explained: They [the police] said there are too many of them doing the same thing and it would take up too much of police time and money to follow it up.Another concerned parent Lynn Baldwin, whose nine-year-old son Shae was on the app, said it should be shut down.She said: The site is full of grown men grooming kids and vulnerable people, it should be banned.There were videos promoting drug taking and sexually suggestive content.Shae got lots of follow requests but when I checked them, they had no content on their accounts so I declined them.He was able to sign up when he was nine and no proof was needed of his age.Mum-of-two Carolyn Wilkins, , whose -year-old daughter Izzy uses the app, told Sun Online: Young girls are doing very inappropriate videos which they should not be doing at that age. I was shocked by that.I am in full support of the campaign being run by The Sun Online.In my view, as a parent of a child who uses the app, TikTok needs an overhaul of how the app operates.Its a  for any child groomer or paedophile. Content does not appear to be vetted and neither are user accounts, meaning it is possible for anyone to use it.Its a major personal security issue. I think young users are really putting themselves at risk.Luckily for me, my daughter is extremely savvy and regularly shows me how she uses the app.We have a close relationship and would never respond to anyone unusual.Mum-of-two Ami Roberts, , said she was shocked to find dark and uncomfortable content on the app.She told the Sun Online: What scared me most was the age of some of the children on the app. Who knows who is behind the screen watching When I downloaded the app, I quickly uncovered the dark side of TikTok and it terried me. I really do believe children and vulnerable people need to stay away from this app for their own safety.I saw videos of kids who must have been six or seven years old who were bopping around to music and lip syncing to silly Kardashian sound clips. It really scared me to see children that young on the app and to know their videos could be shown to anyone.She added: I am in full support of The Suns campaign. The app should be better moderated and safer for kids to use.Chris Moralee, , from Bradford, said he was disgusted by what he found on the app on his ten-year-old son Denvers phone.He said: His phone kept flashing up like someone had messaged. I kept seeing this same mans name coming up.The messages he received said ‘hello are you there ’, ‘stop f***ing ignoring me’, then he said ‘I will find you’, ‘where are you ’ He was sending these messages to a ten-year-old. Denver was terried.The person had a picture. I didn’t report it to police because I deleted the app, I wish I had told the police but I was keen to just get rid of it.I went on to my son’s phone to look at what had been sent and I looked at the content.He’s only ten…there must be a way for them to get parents’ permission to get on it. But there’s no way of them verying their age.I had to tell him that not everyone in the world is nice and people do use these sites to send horrible messages and threaten people and stuff.Mr Morales deleted the app on Denvers phone and his sons school held an assembly on the dangers of social media after he alerted them.Vigilante hunters have warned there are thousands of predators on TikTok - but often dont have the right tools to snare paedophiles on the worlds most downloaded app.Paedophile hunting groups claimed the app was a breeding ground for child predators but said they were limited in the powers they had to nail them.Vigilante group Dark Justice told the Sun Online: You can bet there will be thousands of paedophiles on the app. Its a horrible app.Its been a breeding ground since the very beginning with kids being asked to do stuff.You have paedophiles using fame grooming on kids...so they give likes and so on making kids feel popular and then attempt to get images from them.It should be shut down or made into a veried + app.However they said they couldnt use the app to catch paedophiles as they use still images, while TikTok is video based.Jersey-based paedophile hunter Cheyenne OConnor told the Sun Online:  per cent it is a magnet for paedophiles.Its one of the most used apps for children, every kid I know is on it. In every other video youll find vile comments to children. I would say it really is one of the worst at the moment.TikTok user Liz W, , who goes by the name @bitheoji on the app, explained how the app plays into the hands of predators.She said: If some creepy guy just keeps liking videos of younger girls doing similar audios or soundtracks or hashtags, those are going to keep coming up on his For You page.So its easier for him to find more victims. And I think thats what makes it so easy for predators to come on it and victimise young children.In our latest probe into TikTok we found a user with the name Jimmy Saviles Us.In less than five minutes we found comments underneath videos of schoolchildren dancing and singing such as Wowwww sooooo harrrdddd, Rahh lads be careful  on da line but looking good, Probs  lads, any of you up for sale, this song makes me horny baby and Id so go all  shades on the ginger one in glasses.Others posted comments too graphic for The Sun Online to publish.Last year TikTok was ordered to pay about £.million to settle accusations that it violated childrens privacy law.Campaigners have warned of the risks of young people falling prey to paedophiles on the app.Andy Burrows, NSPCC head of child safety online policy, previously told the Sun Online: Serious questions need to be asked about TikToks moderation practicesusers are able to freely post sexually suggestive comments to children.Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardos, said: Without the right security settings, children broadcasting live video of themselves in their bedrooms over the internet could be targeted by abusers.Go private:Shut out weirdos:Restricted Mode ON:Family Safety Mode:In response, the app said safety was its top priority.A spokesperson from TikTok, which last week announced a new feature to allow parents to control what their kids view, said: We have a number of protective measures in place to reduce the opportunity for misuse and were constantly evolving our measures to further strengthen safety on TikTok. For example, we now prompt any new user under  to make their account private at set-up and again before they publish for the first time.We enable anybody - whether a TikTok user or not - to use our reportingto flag any content or account they deem inappropriate.While our protections wont catch every instance of inappropriate content, we continue to rapidly expand our content moderation teams and improve our technologies and policies so that TikTok can remain a place for positive creative expression.*Name has been changedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course public safety must trump the wellbeing of jihadis.And it’s what Brits want: the Conservatives were elected on a manesto to restore law and order to this country.Unfortunately, peers don’t have to worry about constituents. However they vote and whatever they say, we can never remove them. Which is why they can block necessary and popular legislation when it takes their fancy.Well, we’ve got news for them. The House of Lords limps on because abolishing it is not at the forefront of the public’s mind. Butpeers allow ANOTHER convicted terrorist to maim and kill on our streets, it sure will be.And then the whole sorry institution will be living on borrowed time.BULLYING and banning things is no way to turn this country green.Hiking fuel tax will make the lives of ordinary people harder. As will banning petrol cars for electric ones when there’s no adequate nationwide charging system. Phasing out wood-burning stoves is another sop to the nanny state.And because Brits are eco-conscious already, none of these moves is remotely necessary. Over a third of us have installed a smart meter to monitor energy usage, and four-fths are making an effort to save energy at home.The Government is welcome to give us tempting incentives to stay green.But bossy bans and taxes must end now.IF EU officials believe our Government will cave in to their ludicrous demands, they have another thing coming.When timid Theresa May was leading a minority Government, the EU could strongarm Britain into anything.But now the Leave campaign has been transplanted to No with a whopping mandate, the scales of power have tipped. If the EU can grasp this fact, these trade talks might prove fruitful.If not, Britain will walk out. And European politicians will be the ones to face the music at the ballot box.THREE cheers for our new blue passports. They are a welcome restoration of a powerful symbol of sovereignty.Most Brits consider themselves British, not European, citizens.So EU-issued burgundy passports always rubbed us up the wrong way.At last, a real sign that Britain is OUT.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is already clear the UK and the EU are MILES APART on how any deal would work — and moving further away from each other.Brussels insists this country signs up to stringent rules on a “level playing field” and governance before the talks can proceed. This means they want the UK to agree to stick to a bunch of EU rules even after we have left.At the same time, they want a structure where the EU’s own institutions have a key role in decidingthe UK is doing this or not.The EU view is that the UK will ultimately agree to these demands because the EU is so much bigger.One figure on the European side dismisses the idea that the UK and the EU are “sovereign equals”, pointing out that the EU has a population of million to our million.They think economic reality and the threat of long queues of lorries at Dover will lead to the UK backing down.But the Government is not going to do that. It thinks agreeing to these restrictions would destroy the whole point of Brexit: Our ability to do things dferently.Boris Johnson has been praising chief negotiator David Frost’s speech making this point as “magnicent” to anyone who’ll listen.If the EU insists on these preconditions in the opening round of negotiations, scheduled for the first week of March, the Government will dismiss the talks as pointless.Inside No, they believe Brussels does not realise how much has changed since the General Election.One source tells me: “The EU, understandably, are treating this negotiation like the previous one. But our hand is much stronger because of the mandate we’ve been given by voters.”Downing Street hopes Frost’s speech this week will make the European side realise we are serious about not accepting EU preconditions.One insider points out that Boris Johnson needn’t have an election until  — so nearly every European leader would pay the price at the ballot box before he does for any economic disruption caused by the failure of negotiations.When I asked one Secretary of State why the Government was so adamant that everything had to be settled by the end of this year, I was told: “If there are hiccups, it is better for them to happen in Year One of a government, not Year Three.”It is not just on the future relationship that the UK and EU are heading for a row.A figure close to the negotiations says they are “starting to wake up in Brussels to the fact we have a totally dferent interpretation of the Irish protocol”, which covers arrangements for the Irish border.The appointments of Suella Braverman as Attorney-General and Brandon Lewis as Northern Ireland Secretary indicates the Government is preparing to take a robust approach.This will infuriate the EU side, which believes these arrangements have already been agreed.Interestingly, influential figures on both sides hope the blow-up in trade talks comes SOONER rather than later.Why  Because they think it is only once the two sides have realised just how far apart they really are that the serious negotiations can begin.DOWNING Street is acutely aware that one of the biggest dangers to this government is LOSING VOTERS’ TRUST.If people come to see this administration as just another bunch of politicians who don’t do what they said they would, then it is doomed.No also knows that Boris Johnson’s opponents love to attack him as “untrustworthy”.This didn’t hurt him too much at the election because voters regard most politicians as untrustworthy.Butthere was a clear and compelling example of him breaking his word to voters then that could change, and very quickly.This explains why the promises made in the Tory manesto are being treated as holy writ in government.There is a serious point to Boris’s cringe-making call and response with Cabinet ministers about how they are going to hire , more police officers.He knows they need to do this to show a sceptical electorate that he keeps his promises.During the campaign, he admitted that the questions about whether he keeps his word made his “blood boil”.The whole emphasis on promise-keeping is bad news for Heathrow and the third runway.In , Boris promised to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop it being built. Sothe bulldozers move in on his watch it will be acutely embarrassing.You can just imagine the split screen of his comments and the ground being flattened – it would dramatise the whole trust issue.This is one of the reasons why I think the third runway won’t end up happening.If in the next few weeks the Mayor of London wins his judicial review against the decision to go ahead with it, I doubt the Government will appeal the verdict.But Patel is not the first Home Secretary to have dficult relations with him.Allies of Amber Rudd believed that Rutnam should have gone when she quit over the handling of the Windrush scandal, which was as much an institutional failure as a political one.Friends of hers believe one of the reasons why the review into it has yet to be published is that it makes clear that the institutional Home Office is to blame for what went wrong.The ministers keep changing but the Home Office has not been “fit for purpose” for some time.It is proof that effective government is going to require reform of Whitehall.I understand Trump spontaneously raises the issue with social confidants, as well as figures inside his administration. He complains about the “betrayal” it represents.It isn’t just Trump who is cross. A host of Tory MPs are still pushing No to give an indication as to when the  per cent cap on Huawei involvement in the G network will be reduced to zero.The question is whether Boris will have done anything to address these concerns before he heads to the US for the G summit and a meeting with Trump in JuneThe contest hasn’t captured the public’s imagination and it has mostly served as a reminder of how in hock Labour still is to Corbynite ideology.None of the three remaining candidates is proposing the kind of break from the Corbyn years that is needed.Until it can break these shackles, Labour won’t be a national party again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson must know this is his one big chance for a bold and imaginative boost to the whole economy.As a senior minister warned on Sunday: “You don’t make the North rich by making the South poor.“Nor did the Red Wall ­collapse because those new Tory voters wanted more socialism.”Sunak’s first Budget should be the single most ­dramatic moment of the early Johnson era, setting Brexit Britain’s course as a sovereign trading nation.March , , must stand comparison with the stunning Tory Budgets of Geoffrey Howe in  and Nigel Lawson in  — both high water marks in the fortunes of post-war Britain.Otherwise, what was the point of the bombshell Cabinet shake-up that toppled Sajid Javid and sent shockwaves through our mandarin-dominated Whitehall machine Budget Day is an unrepeatable chance to show that UK plc is open for business — and begin repairing the damage inflicted by previous Chancellors.It’s no good saying Sunak had only four weeks to rewrite Javid’s tax and spending plans.What is the point of a whizz-kid with all those Goldman Sachs-charged brain cellshe can’t deliver the revolution we need This opportunity — more or less marking Boris Johnson’s first  days since the election — will not come again.If the Treasury has been doing its job, it will have drafted contingency plans for every possible challenge — tax cuts, spending leaps, higher thresholds or merging income tax with National Insurance contributions.It will have cost-and-benefit assessments for all eventualities, from a new p top rate to picking cities like Liverpool, Belfast and Glasgow as job-magnet freeports.The Treasury has a blinkered view about tax. It is a means of raising money, on a one-way ratchet.The Treasury does not do “dynamic” economics — lowering taxes and leaving voters to splash their newly acquired cash.This is where Sunak can earn his spurs as an innovative, daring, free-thinking Treasury boss. Stamp duty tops everyone’s calls for reform.George Osborne’s loathed property tax hike paralysed the housing market, locked up billions in hoarded capital, destroyed job mobility — and reduced Treasury revenues.Cutting stamp duty would instantly free up spending and boost the whole economy — especially for tradesmen and the hard-hit High Street.Speaking of shops, business rates need drastic reform to save our shuttered town centres. Why not tax the property owners instead of their struggling tenant shop-keepers All these measures would boost productivity — the amount we earn as a country for every hour worked.Ours is woeful. The average French worker produces more in four days than we do in a full week.Firms have learned to rely on cheap foreign labour, subsidised by taxpayers with welfare top-ups.Home Secretary Priti Patel’s immigration shake-up will cut the flow of cheap labour and force firms to pay proper wages for low-paid care home and service industry workers.The Chancellor can also help by reforming the Factory Tax and encouraging firms to invest in new machinery and technology — the key to economic growth.Whatever Sunak does on March , his duty is to make sure Britain is braced and ready for Brexit.Whatever he does will upset the critics. Sir Geoffrey Howe’s revolutionary  Budget was denounced by  “top” economists in The Times.In , the SNP’s Alex Salmond was booted out of the Commons for heckling Nigel Lawson’s tax-slashing measures.Together those controversial budgets cured Britain as the Sick Man Of Europe and began  years of unbroken economic growth.We need Rishi Sunak to walk in their giant footsteps and turn Britain into the offshore economic dynamo so feared by our erstwhile European partners.It has bluffed its way through the past few decadesby posturing as an integrated political and economic colossus.In reality, like the Wizard Of Oz, it has concealed its naked corruption, barefaced greed and brazen incompetence behind a curtain of bluster and denial.Britain was always there to impose reality on this world of self-delusion.

Thats the food for the yeast.He said thatshe hadnt been a candidate for a liver transplant - and required to undergo urine testing - the disorder may have never been discovered.Doctors prescribed the woman with oral antungals to get rid of the yeast infection, which will hopefully allow her to have the much-needed op.It is caused by an overgrowth of yeast in the gut that turns excess carbs from food into booze.The booze in then absorbed into the blood stream and sufferers become drunk.As the condition is so rare very little is known about it and it is not widely recognised.Because of the nature of the condition people are mistaken for closet alcoholics.Those who have the condition may appear drunk, sweaty, confused and have less coordination after eating a meal that triggers an episode.As the condition is so rare a cure is not yet known, but antungal medications to control the growth of yeast in the stomach are thought to help.While the woman is the first to have bladder fermentation syndrome, there have been a handful of other similar cases affecting the gut.Known as auto-brewery syndrome , its usually caused by yeast accumulating in the intestines after ingesting sugar.It can cause sufferers to feel intoxicated and unable to perform simple tasks.In , a man from North Carolina was reportedly charged with drink driving due to the extremely rare condition.The unidentited -year-old had been pulled over by police and breathalysed - with the results showing he as five times over the limit.He argued that he hadnt consumed any alcohol but cops - and his family - refused to believe him.It was until  that he was diagnosed with ABS when tests revealed that every time he consumed carbohydrates his blood alcohol level shot up.Medics treated his gut microflora with a combination of anti-fungal therapies and probiotics.His condition is understood to have been triggered by a course of antibiotics prescribed in  for an injury to his thumb.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Max spoke of his hope that the new law will help to save countless lives. “I would love to see it making that dference,” said the schoolboy, of Winsford, Cheshire. “I hope families tell one another what they wantthe worst should happen. “That will make it so much easier for transplant teams to approach them.” He added: “When you are waiting for a transplant, every day counts.

Professor Sir Michael Marmot issued a major review today warning the rise in le expectancy had slowed dramatically since . Sir Michael - who has said there is a strong argument for higher tax on the rich - warned health inequalities are widening between the most and least deprived parts of England. He said: From the beginning of the th century, England experienced continuous improvements in le expectancy. But from  these improvements slowed dramatically, almost grinding to a halt. He added: England has lost a decade. Pretty much - with a few dips and bounces - le expectancy improved about one year every four years from the end of the th century until , then it slowed down dramatically. If health has stopped improving, that means society has stopped improving andhealth inequalities continue and in fact increase, that means inequalities in society have been increasing. Prof Marmot said while poverty was an issue, austerity had taken its toll on equity and health. He added: Austerity has taken a signicant toll on equity and health and it is likely to continue to do so. If you ask methat is the reason for the worsening health picture, Iaposd say it is highly likely that is responsible for the le expectancy flatlining, peopleaposs health deteriorating and the widening of health inequalities. The report, Health Equity In England: The Marmot Review  Years On, was commissioned by the Health Foundation charity.  Chief executive Dr Jenner Dixon said: We urgently need a new national health inequalities strategy, backed by investment in the factors that have the most powerful impact on health, such as early years and youth services, housing, education, social security and good quality work. The report found le expectancy in men had risen by about half a year from . in - to . in -. In women it rose by about a third of a year from . to . during the same period. Prof Marmot said this compared to le expectancy generally improving by about one year every four years for a century up until . And there are huge dferences across the country.The dference in le expectancy at birth between the least and most deprived deciles was . years for men and . years for women in -. That has risen from . and . respectively in -, the report added. For some more deprived groups outside London, le expectancy has even fallen, the report said. The slowdown in le expectancy is not down to exceptionally cold winters or virulent flu, and cannot be attributed solely to problems with the NHS or social care – although declining funding relative to need in each sector will undoubtedly have played a role, it said.

Sarah and her family were all packed and ready for their taxi to arrive when they got a text to say the Jet flight to Birmingham had been cancelled because of the weather. Mrs Smith, , said: “We were all packed up. The flight was at .pm. In the villa there are  of us and the taxi was supposed to park up at pm. “We were all ready to go and we got a text message at .am to say the flight was cancelled. “It did say to go to the airport because they would sort out a hotel but we are in a villa and spoke to the owner who said they have no one coming in so they are quite happy for us to stay as long as we need to.”  Mrs Smith, who works for Lincolnshire County Council, had been due back to work today as had her husband, who works at an engineering firm in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire.

Their car is also still parked at Birmingham Airport, meaning they will have to fork out the extra money needed to compensate for that as well as the additional cost of food while they are away. The family are confident any money spent can be claimed back off their holiday insurance, but for now say they are waiting for answers while continuing to be stuck in the dficult weather conditions.  Mrs Smith said: “It is just really thick, heavy cloud and it has coated everyone with a red dust. “Every single surface is coated in thick, red dust. The pool, the table and our towels.

After spotting unfinished renovations - as the vulnerable pensioners had recently parted company with a dferent trader, who had been building an extension - he offered to complete the work at the same cost. But on their first day, workmen demolished the coupleaposs living room wall without their knowledge or permission while they were out at a hospital appointment.  “I was in shock, I just couldn’t believe that my wall between the living room and the hall could just crumble,” the husband, who has sadly now died, said in a later interview. PT said the wall had fallen apart while they were removing plaster. The companyaposs managing director, Thomas William Penfold, was jailed yesterday at Guildford Crown Court for fraudulent trading and money laundering, and will serve concurrent sentences of four and three years. A second employee, Glenn Steel, was also jailed for  months after being convicted of fradulent trading. Among the other claims made by the company were that the coupleaposs roof was so unsafe it could kill anyone underneath it - requiring work costing £,. They said the loft was in a poor state, meaning the whole roof would need to be replaced. The couple - who say they felt trapped by the builders - agreed to pay £, for the work, with the company offering to supply extras such as a stair lt and paving in the front and rear gardens for free.  But police were alerted to the scam when the couple transferred a £, payment. Suspecting it was a fraud, their bank froze PTaposs account and alerted officers, who in turn contacted trading standards. They visited the property the same day and found aposa building siteapos. Following investigations by a building surveyor, it was found that there was no reason for the living room wall to have been knocked down and the roof simply needed a few replacement tiles. The work the cowboy builders quoted for should have cost a maximum of £,. Thankfully, the couple were able to recover most of the money paid - but lost the £, transferred for the original work, which had been withdrawn from PTaposs account.  The workmen were found to have caused major structural damage to the house which would cost £, to put right. The coupleaposs plight was brought to court by Buckinghamshire and Surrey Trading Standards. PT - who tried to thwart the investigation by saying it was causing the elderly couple aposalarm and distressapos - were also been found to have fraudulently taken money from a south London couple. They paid a total of £, for work, which has since been deemed unnecessary and said to contravene building regulations. Trading standards will now seethey can confiscate Penfold and Steel’s assets to compensate the victims. Denise Turner-Stewart, Cabinet Member for Community Safety, Fire and Resilience, said it was aposvitalapos that cases like these are brought to court.

While many non-believers associate this time with giving something up, for the church it is seen as vital spiritual preparation when they grow closer to God ahead of Easter. However there are subtle dferences in the way this time of year is celebrated between the many denominations of Christianity. From the meaning behind the day, to the ious start and finishing dates, here’s everything you need to know about Lent and its ious traditions. What is Lent  In the Christian calendar Lent is treated as a period of reflection and getting closer to God when people fast from food and festivities. It lasts for  days in the run up to Easterand symbolises the last few weeks before Jesus’ crucixion and resurrection which included  days and nights alone in the Judean Desert where he was tempted by Satan. Lent begins on Ash Wednesday with the day before - Shrove Tuesday- being a time when people across Europe have used up foods which have been traditionally forbidden during Lent. These include milk, eggs, sugar and fat, which were used to make pancakes so as to avoid them going to waste.When does Lent begin  The dates for Easter, and subsequently Lent, Ash Wednesday and Shrove Tuesday y from year to year. However the date normally falls between mid February and early March. In  Ash Wednesday, which marks the start of Lent after Shrove Tuesday, falls on February  for Western churches. For the Eastern Orthodox churches the first day of Lent is Clean Monday which this year falls on March . When does Lent finish   While the start of Lent is easy to define, the end of the celebrations is more complicated. In Western churches it ends on Holy Saturday, the day before Easter itself. This year that’s on April . In the liturgical season Lent ends two days earlier on Maundy Thursday, while for Eastern churches it ends on the Friday before Palm Sunday . Which days are excluded from Lent  Lent is  days, however the six Sundays that fall within the period are not included meaning there are  days between the first day of Lent and the last. The six Sundays aren’t counted because they’re each seen as a “mini-Easter” celebrating Jesus’ victory over sin and death. What do people give up   Many Christians tend to give up something to “pury” them, which includes a wide iety of foods and forms of entertainment. Adults tend to give up things such as alcohol, coffee or smoking while children may refrain from eating chocolate, sweets or playing with certain toys. Others use Lent to volunteer or donate money to charity.  Shrove Tuesday   Pancake Day Shrove Tuesday - more commonly known as Pancake Day - is on February  this year. The word shrove comes from “shrive” which means absolution for sins by doing penance with the day’s full name getting its name from Christians trying to be ‘shriven’ before Lent. The association with pancakes came as worshippers used up rich foods such as eggs, milk and sugar before the Lent fast which begins the following day.

Initially we were talking about £. million to get everything up and running but we’ve managed to do it on a shoestring budget and do things in stages.“The first stage was the xm astroturf to give clubs the opportunity to play and get affiliated with Dundee East. That grew very quickly and then we moved onto a full-sized pitch.“We want a full stadium as well with changing facilities, physio and boot rooms, and add on some post-match hospitality or event space.“The idea was to get the pitch up and running first and use the revenue from that to move to the next stage.“Over the next few years we are hoping to continue expanding the ground by investing, hopefully, in a proper pavilion.“We have a stand going up in the next two or three weeks and we will, hopefully, have the old Douglas Lads building next to the ground brought up to standard.” vw, px\"  He added: “The hub is for the whole community.“When I was younger I used to play football where the skate factory is now in Douglas and that’s not there anymore.“There are less and less places for kids to play football and we want to keep them off the streets, teach them people skills and give a good, safe environment to play sport.“That’s exactly what it’s done.“Since the full-size park has been finished, along with the # astro, over  kids are playing every single week. That’s fantastic.“From my point of view, driving home every evening and seeing the lights on and kids playing football gives a huge sense of satisfaction.“The good thing is the money that has been put in here will be here for a long, long time – everything generated goes straight back into it.“I’m very passionate and seeing things come through as part of the committee is fantastic.“We have a long, long way to go but the hope is we have the pathway from four-years-old right through to the adults. Hopefully, in time we see kids coming through the juveniles into the amateurs, maybe to the juniors, and possibly to the seniors.” vw, px\"  Deuchars, whose background is in engineering, will be known to Dundee United fans for his former company GA Engineering for their sponsorship of Gussie Park and the help he has given the club over the years.He added: “I have put money into Dundee United but I like to focus on grassroots. If I put £ million into United, it would be there for one season but I do that into a community club it is there for a letime and is le-changing for a lot of kids who want to play football.”It’s not been all plain sailing, however. He added: “There have a few teething issues but they have all been addressed. We’ve spoken to local residents as well as MSPs and councillors to resolve the issues.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e4f982ededcf6.53755633.jpg ","title":"mark connolly high standards leads to criticism we must deal with","story":"Mark Connolly believes Dundee United are victims of their own success but have the right mentality to bounce back from a dip in form.The United defender admits the squad have been disappointed by their recent run, particularly in the league where they are without a win in three after last week’s - draw at Alloa, as they welcome Inverness to Tannadice tonight.However, he points to their -point lead at the top of the Championship and previous -game unbeaten run as proof they have the quality and mentality to get back to winning ways.“We were disappointed and there were a few discussions after the Alloa game about certain things,” the Irishman said.“Recently, in the last three league games, we haven’t done as well as we had before. We’ve picked up a few points but we’re not where we were.“I don’t feel like we’ve let that bother us, though. Now we’ve got the mentality to focus on the next game. Tonight we’ve got Inverness, who I feel will come out and play against us, so it will be an open and enjoyable game.“We’ve been training hard all week after last weekend and it’s just keeping that mindset of continuing on.“That’s been the big change at the club – how we react and how we deal with certain situations.“We’ve shown it before and we’ll do it again.“We’ve set high standards and when you don’t meet them you get disappointed.“It’s certainly not something that’s lingering around us. We speak about it because we’ve got a tight-knit group and we can be open with our opinions.“Once it’s said and done it’s straight back to the drawing board.“It’s a normal week whether we win, lose or draw. We drew and didn’t concede so we have to take the positives.“We go again against Inverness tonight. We’re  points clear and we want to keep it that way and open the gap as much as we can.“Hopefully we can. Like we keep saying in the dressing-room, all we can do is keep focusing on ourselves and winning games. We’ve done brilliantly this season and at the startyou told us we’d be  points clear at this point we’d be delighted.“It’s an incredible thing but we also know what football’s like and how, at this time of the season, everyone is still fighting for something.”Connolly reckons theof Paul McMullan and Louis Appere to the fold tonight is a huge boost for the Tangerines as they enter the final third of the season.Speaking about the squad’s injury problems, the -year-old added: “If you look at it it’s boys that, throughout the season, have been big players for us going forward.“They’ve provided a lot of goals and assists. Them coming out of the reckoning has been a bit dficult.“It’s good to have Louis, hopefully, back tonight, McMullan is right there nearly fully back and even Clarky is a little ahead of schedule.“As players that gives you a little bit of a buzz.“It’s tough but we’re a team and a big club so we need to deal with it.“We’ve got good players sitting on the bench that have come in and done a job.“I think it’s been dficult because we’re not blessed with too many out-and-out wingers.“We’ve had people playing out of position to change it up so once we get those boys back we’ll be in a better place.“Dillonand Rakishhave come in and did really well. It’s just getting them used to the standards, fitness levels and everything we do at the club.”Of his own situation, Connolly is just happy to be back playing after putting a troublesome hamstring injury behind him last year and since starting every game of .“It was a big thing for me because, mentally, it was tough being injured.“I’ve put a lot of work in to strengthen in my body.“My hamstrings just weren’t strong enough for the way we were playing and training.“It’s good to be back in and, hopefully, I can just stay fit.“I’ve done that, I’m feeling good and strong so it’s good to get a run in the team.“The main thing is us winning this league and, hopefully, we can push on in the next few weeks to get it done.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/dundee-united-dunfermline.jpg ","title":"mr consistency smith wont get clouded by hype until title is won","story":"If one player sums up Dundee United’s season so far it’s the ever-dependable Liam Smith.Smith has been ‘steady Eddie’ or ‘Mr Consistency’ at right-back for a United team which has taken all challenges put before them in their stride as they close in on the Championship title.His performances may not necessarily grab the headlines but it’s for all the right reasons he flies under the radar.The -year-old former Hearts and St Mirren man is the ultimate team player and a coach’s dream – selfless, humble but, most importantly, committed to the cause – and his attitude is one mirrored in a Terrors team now set to be crowned champions come May.Reflecting on last Friday’s hugely signicant - win over Inverness at Tannadice, which opened a -point gap at the top on the back of a five-game winless run, Smith was ever-measured and focused on the bigger picture when it could have been easy to get caught up in the buzz.“It was a good night all round,” he said.“We knew the importance of the game going into it, not just because of our previous few results, but with them being second and aiming to extend the gap.“I think the performance, result and everything went well for us.“Outside noise is expected, with people starting to panic and say that we’re going through a rough patch but inside the changing-room we knew we just hadn’t quite hit the performances we had been previously.“We set ourselves high standards and last Friday I think we got back to that and we’re delighted with the result.“I think it was noted last week there were boys having a go at each other in the dressing-room but it just shows that every result matters to us.“It doesn’t matterit’s Inverness or Alloa or Arbroath, we’re all here because we want to end up top of the league come the end of the season. At the moment we’re on course.”The aim now for Smith is to pick up another three points against Dunfermline at East End Park on Saturday as the Tangerines look to seal the deal as soon as possible.“Prior to our little blip, we won nine games in a row so we were never getting carried away,” he added.“It will be the same now. We enjoyed Friday night and where the result leaves us but we’re back now and looking at the next one.“Dunfermline is about ticking off another three points.

We are building towards next season already as well.“As long as the strikers stay fit.“There are always ‘what-s’ but we have Andrew Nelson back and Paul McGowan can play up there when he needs to.“Strength-wise I do think we are better now than we were going into the Partick game as a squad.

It was obviously really windy and there wasn’t much football played, but I think – no disrespect – butwe were maybe playing against a possession-based team like Celtic or Rangers, they’d be bombarding our goal with crosses and shots, but it didn’t feel like we were getting troubled too much.“We maybe made a couple of mistakes at the wrong times and they’ve scored two good goals, but it didn’t feel like they were cutting us open.“We had a few half chances, but it just wasn’t meant to be our day on Saturday.“We’ve got to dust ourselves down, rest and recover now, as we’ve got a full week’s work ahead of us.”Aberdeen started Saturday in the Premiership’s third sport by virtue of their superior goal dference over Motherwell, but they’ve dropped a point behind the Steelmen after their - draw with Hamilton.McGinn admits the squad is frustrated they’ve not capitalised on their chances to pull away in third as attentions turn to the Scottish Cup again this weekend.McInnes’ men travel to Paisley for a quarter-final clash with St Mirren – a game which kicks off at .pm. When theyhome, winger McGinn wants Pittodrie to be a fortress for Aberdeen like it has been at earlier stages of his Reds career, and said: “It’s been frustrating for everyone. We’re just happy we’re still in the cup.“We’ve always been a good side at home and teams have struggled to come here and go away with the points. We definitely need to get back to winning ways sooner rather than later in the league.“The games are running out.“There’s been chances there for us to open up a gap or close the gap on Motherwell but we didn’t.“We’re not going to get too many more opportunities to get back into third and open the gap on the rest. But we’ll put the league to one side for the moment and % concentration goes into Saturday now.“Off the back of a disappointing result, we want to get a very positive result.”"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters the future for organ donation","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPresently around , people in the UK are waiting for organ transplantation. All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard.

An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held against the backdrop of a cut to our capital budget this year of  percent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren.

In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power.

It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

If Scotland had voted Yes, does anyone seriously think David Cameron would have staged that referendum on Brexit "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Why can t men dress properly nowadays ","story":"Football manager Pep Guardiola stared out: saturnine, grizzled, but above all terribly dressed. What was he thinking when he walked out the door  Did nobody call him back and suggest he change into something better  News of Manchester City being slapped with a two-year UEFA ban would have been at the forefront of his mind, I know, but thatrsquos no justication for his down-at-heel appearance. Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age. What baffles women is why, with such a simple formula for success ndash unlike the minefield of female fashion ndash there are still so many men dressing badly."},{"url":null,"title":"gas-power-castles-banished-history-books","story":"HES said it aimed to be ldquonet-zero by , in line with the Scottish Governmentrsquos target.The organisation also plans to reduce the amount of visitor vehicles by  by creating parking hubs where it has clusters of properties.The initiatives are part of a new action plan unveiled by heritage chiefs this week to preserve Scotlandrsquos historic places in light of the threat of climate change.

Terns are known to be highly iable in breeding numbers and it is too early to saythis trend is going to continue.Scotlandrsquos breeding seabirds are of international importance. A total of  species of seabird regularly breed in Scotland and they are not only vulnerable to changes in the countryrsquos seas.Many migrate across the Atlantic and technology is beginning to improve scientistsrsquo understanding of their movements.A UK wide seabird census is currently underway and the results from this will help to provide an overview on all of the species of seabirds breeding around Scotland.Offering grounds for hope, Mr Foster said that puffins, one of the countryrsquos most popular marine species, were among the biggest winners after the eradication of predators.He also highlighted early signs that populations of wading birds have received a boost following the removal of mink.ldquoOn the islands where eradications have happened, we are seeing population increases for some species, he said.ldquoPrimarily its the chicks and eggs they predate on but for birds that burrow, like puffins, they predate the adults as well.ldquoWe have seen increases for puffins on the Shiants and also big increases for puffins on Canna after the removal of rats.ldquoAmerican mink have also been an issue, particularly on the islands around Argyll and the west coast, but there are efforts ongoing to remove mink from these places.ldquoWhere mink have been removed in local areas, we are seeing some improvements, not only with seabirds but with waders as well."},{"url":null,"title":"climate-comment-can-bit-meet-net-zero","story":"A ldquoclimate emergency needs a robust response. According to the philosopher Peter Springer, developed countries like the UK have an ethical duty to lead the world out of this crisis. After all, the UK has been partially responsible for creating the problem through its past actions. Much of its financial and intellectual capital base has been constructed on a legacy of environmental damage. It needs to put this right.The UK Government is committed to taking the country to net zero by  following the Committee on Climate Changersquos recommendation and analysis of the pathways to net zero. But the committee was also clear that there are huge policy challenges associated with meeting this objective.One of the most sobering aspects of the report from the Committee on Climate Change is the fact that we need to decarbonise the economy across all sectors simultaneously. It isnrsquot good enough to think we can do a little bit of this and then a little bit of that. The scale of this challenge is truly daunting not just for those who need to plan and implement these changes but for every single citizen. This will affect everybodyrsquos le. As I have said before, there is no point putting a bung in the tail pipe of a metaphorical car to stop its emissions without re-engineering, and perhaps even re-imagining, the car itself.Even though government has established a clear national objective, nobody should imagine that this is someone rsquos problem. It is not, as often implied, for government alone to deliver the changes which are needed. The government needs to play its part but there is a job for everybody and for every organisation and business. For example,every decision we make, from buying food in the local supermarket to deciding where to go on holiday, was informed by information about the environmental costs of the dferent options, we could probably make a massive and instantaneous dference. Many people already do this when deciding how much meat they eat, but this is just a start. Even small, almost imperceptible nudges to our decisions could be transformative. Government need to make sure we all have this information and, once delivered, we all have an ethical duty to take it into account.This is why I have taken on the job of leading the aspiration of the University of St Andrews to reach net zero in its own business within the time scales set by government. This university has adopted net zero as part of its strategy and make it a corporate responsibility. My job is to hold it to account and help it to reach its objective.Like any organisation, the university is going to find this dficult. It has already done much to reduce its carbon footprint, but there is only so much it can do on its own. Carbon, and other environmental impacts like water use, permeate almost everything the university does. Wringing the carbon and water out is going to take determination, smart decision-making and imaginative business practice.A university has a special role in the mission to achieve net zero. Apart from being an exemplar to normal businesses, it moulds the future through the research it does and the people it trains. It has global influence through its networks of academics and can itself be a living laboratory for exploring the kind of actions and technical fixes which demonstrate feasibility. A university is not just a crucible for the creation of new ideas but also an integrated part of delivering these ideas to meet the national objectives. It has an opportunity to create impact which is much greater than its size.Sir Ian Boyd is a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews and former Chief Scientic Adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9295275.jpg?type=article-full","title":"herald-seeks-industry-figures-join-panel-cop26-climate-change-event","story":"The Heraldrsquos campaign has led the way in highlighting the environmental challenges and possibilities, fear and hopes facing all of us.

The party went up  seats at the last general election in December  to  MPs on % of the vote. Polls show support for independence sitting at % in some cases.So when it comes to a profit and loss sheet, the party looks healthy. Behind the scenes, though, itrsquos a mess.How can this be  How can a party be doing so well and so bad at the same time  The answer lies in the fact that hardcore independence supporters will cut the SNP any amount of slack when it comes to scandals and mismanagement because itrsquos the only vehicle to get them what they want.That skews democracy, and it hasnt been good for the governance of Scotland.The SNP has been in power since  ndash in political terms thatrsquos an aeon. Over that time, the SNP has conformed to all the ills that beset political parties in office for y periods. Itrsquos got sloppy, fractious, and stupid. But unlike other political parties, itrsquos protected from the consequences by its super-weapon: the get out of jail free card its base of supporters lend it because of independence.Itrsquos like the Trump Effect.

The same was true of Boris Johnson and Brexiteers. The same is true of the SNP and its base ndash because it wears independence like a shield.The problem is, though, therersquos no shield for Scotland or the Scottish people when it comes to bad government by the SNP.Education is a mess. Teachers are at the end of their tether, and results are atrocious. Pass rates for Higher English last year saw a drop of .% compared to  ndash thatrsquos  fewer pupils passing. Advanced Higher English pass rates dropped by .%.The pass rate for Higher History fell from .% to .%. Higher Modern Studies was down by .%. In Maths, the pass rate fell by .%.To make matters much worse, the Government was accused of trying to sneak these bad figures out by releasing them at night. It looked low and crafty.:MacAskill says tells SNP to focus on lsquogrunt workrsquo not marchingWhile education soaks up most of the negative headlines, therersquos also serious problems with policing and hospitals.There was a time ndash maybe five or six years ago, before the world went mad with identity disorder ndash when nearly all voters judged governments on how effective they were in office. Today, thatrsquos not the case for many voters.What matters to many is whether a political party reflects their sense of identity. This becomes a force field of protection, a magical cloak of invincibility. As long as a party reaffirms the identity of their base ndash be that via Brexit or independence ndash it will avoid the kind of supporter dissatisfaction which would end other governments.This creates a huge distortion in public debate ndash the essential cornerstone of democracy.Yet despite having this super-weapon in its possession, the power of identity as political protection, the SNP is now absurdly starting to juggle with live grenades.Itrsquos splitting rapidly on the best path towards independence. Some would like to see Sturgeon go. Independence, which until now has conferred protection, is beginning to damage the party from within.The isions in the party have crystallised in the Holyrood constituency of Edinburgh Central - Ruth Davidsonrsquos old stomping ground. Two big SNP names are jockeying for a place on the ballot - Joanna Cherry and Angus Robertson.The pair represent the two sides of the party split. Cherry is on whatrsquos been called the Salmond side, and Robertson is on the Sturgeon wing. In the crudest of terms, itrsquos the more populist branch versus the social democrat side of the party.:Analysis: Does Derek Mackay scandal mark the beginning of the end for the SNP Therersquos already mutterings of Cherry replacing Sturgeon as party leader. Of course, this isnrsquot the only split in the party. The SNP is also tearing itself apart over the increasingly toxic debate about trans rights.Letrsquos not forget that the SNP has also just gone through the Derek Mackay scandal, and itrsquos still got to weather the fall-out from the coming Alex Salmond trial.So internally, things look pretty awful for the SNP, but in terms of electoral performance and opinion polls the party is laughing hellip for now.Moving against Sturgeon would change the game for the party. Sturgeon has centre-ground appeal. Plenty of Unionist and No voters hate her, but to many people, shersquos seen as professional, decent, intelligent, and with her heart in the right place.Her rivals come across as isive, angry and slippery. The party wouldnrsquot lose its force field of identity, its shield,it lost Sturgeon ndash the base would still be there ndash but it would damage its centre-ground appeal.Of course, Sturgeon is to blame for a lot of this herself. Shersquos teased the base with independence for years in order to keep power. Now her more headstrong and ill-considered colleagues want to get on with it come what may.A grubby political assassination of Sturgeon would be the beginning of the end for the SNP, and that would inevitably mean the beginning of the end of the campaign for independence.

This was of concern to the committee given the pivotal role music has been proven to play in pupil attainment as well as the positive impact learning an instrument and playing in an ensemble has been shown to have.As committee convener Clare Adamson, the SNP MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw, said at the time: ldquoThere is little doubt about the positive benefits that music can have on us as iniduals, as communities and indeed to the wider Scottish culture and economy.Yet here we are a year later and Edinburgh City Council has just waved through a plan that will see pound, slashed from its music budget between next year and  while yesterday councillors in North Lanarkshire sat down and actually ndash unbelievably ndash discussed the prospect of scrapping the arearsquos music service completely. Representatives in Dumfries and Galloway, who have already faced the wrath of incredulous parents at a series of budget roadshows, will have that very same discussion when they meet on Thursday.They should all be thoroughly ashamed. Take Edinburgh. Though a consultation is to be carried out before any changes are made, the fact that half a million poundsrsquo worth of savings has to be made in the instrumental music service means something is going to have to give. Teacher numbers and instrument choice will almost certainly be cut, while it is all but unavoidable that some kind of charging for lessons will be introduced.The impact that cuts of any kind will have is obvious, with fewer teachers giving lessons in fewer instruments inevitably meaning fewer opportunities to learn. Meanwhile, evidence gathered over the past few years shows that, regardless of any concessions that might be introduced, the introduction of fees will lead to certain children no longer being able to learn. Yes, those with wealthy enough parents will be able to pay or go private and, yes, those from poorer backgrounds will not have to pay at all, but for those in the middle ndash those whose parents are in work but who have no cash to spare ndash their musical future looks bleak. In a country where every child is supposed to have the right to a broad and deep education, that is an unforgivable dereliction of duty.That would be bad enough at the best of times, and the postcode lottery that sees children in Glasgow pay nothing to learn an instrument while their counterparts in Clackmannanshire must pay pound shows just how much some children are already being let down. But in a city that each year becomes a festival-hosting cultural hotspot that puts the whole of Scotland on the global stage that has worked hard to ensure those from its poorest areas are given the most opportunities to attend those festivals and that last year sought in spectacular style to break down some of the perceived barriers to musical attainment by transforming Heart of Midlothianrsquos football ground into a concert arena for the world-famous LA Phil, Edinburgh City Councilrsquos decision is nothing short of perverse.What, after all, is the point in being a world-famous patron of the artsthat doesnrsquot extend to every one of your own schoolchildren  Does Edinburgh really want its future contribution to be a trust-fund backed one Yet while the actions of inidual authorities may be reprehensible, they are only getting away with making these decisions because the Scottish Government ndash the same government that continually talks about the benefits that learning an instrument can bring ndash does not class instrumental tuition as core to the curriculum. That means it doesnrsquot provide specic funding for music lessons, which in turn means that no matter how many times ministers say councils should be providing the service free of charge ndash which is often ndash they are under no obligation to do so.It is hardly surprising, given the never-ending cuts councils have been forced to make, that every bit of discretionary spend has become fair-game at budget-setting time. Yet there is something particularly distasteful about making children shoulder the burden of any of these cuts and something especially fishy about gunning for music at this particular point.Only last week a Scottish Government report revealed that the number of children gaining Highers in core subjects dropped by as much as  per cent in the last academic year while the attainment gap between rich and poor has continued to widen. What better time for three local authorities in which the SNPrsquos influence is weak to highlight a major inconsistency in the Governmentrsquos approach to education And there is something deeply inconsistent in the Government saying on the one hand that music is so central to wellbeing and attainment that is must be provided free while on the other sending councils the message that it is up to them to decide whether to provide it. Yes, it is expensive to provide one-to-one or small-group tuition to children outside a classroom setting and, yes, there are very many demands on government funds. But , as has been proven, that improves childrenrsquos concentration, collegiality and attainment across the board ndash something that will have an impact across their entire lives ndash surely it has got to be seen as money well spent As things stand too many of the children our education system proclaims to cherish are being used as political footballs while a group of teachers who have dedicated their lives to nurturing talent regardless of where it is found remain in the firing line. The only way to end this is for the Government to prove it believes music is as vital to a childrsquos education as maths or English by ringfencing the funding to provide it.

However, doing so can mean your insurer can refuse to pay out any claims made, for exampleyour car is broken into in the location it actually resides.Insurance companies have investigative departmentsdedicated to making sure information on your insurance and claims are correct, so while you may think you can get away with not updating your address, the likelihood is is that this will be found out when you make a claim.. Ignoring your morning commuteThere are three types of car usage that insurance covers social only, social and commuting, and business. Social only insurance covers driving for social or leisure use driving to and from friendsrsquo houses, going to the supermarket, etc. The commute to and from work, or even to and from the train station, are not covered by this policy, so upgrading to a social and commuting is necessary, evenyou only commute a few times a month. Insurance companies may dispute or refuse claims made during a commutethe policy is social use only, evenit is claimed to be only a one off.If you use your car for work purposes outside of commuting, for example using it to get to meetings, or carrying equipment, you will need to get business cover.. Not informing your insurer about any car modicationsCar modications can affect your insurance premium for two reasonsthey increase the likelihood of an accident, orthey increase the likelihood of theft. Optional add ons for brand new cars, including something as simple and common as fitting in a SatNav, can impact insurance so itrsquos important to ensure these options are noted when applying for insurance. Your insurer will also need to be made aware of modications that are made during your policy, as this may require a change in policy.. Not informing your insurance company of minor accidentsIn the case of small bumps or minor accidents where only cosmetic damage occurs, itrsquos common for motorists to have their car fixed without making a claim. However, evenyou intend not to claim, it is important to inform your insurance of any damage received, as to not do so is a breach of your policy. This helps in the event that the other driver changes their mind and decides to claim, and also ensures damage is accounted foryou do need to claim after future incidents - damage which is inconsistent with a claim may mean that your claim is denied.. lsquoFrontingrsquoInsurance for young drivers often costs more than groups deemed less of a risk, and one way some motorists try and get round these higher premiums is by having a low risk driver, such as a parent or partner, named as the main policy holder, and adding the real motorist as a named driver. If you get caught lsquofrontingrsquo, your policy will immediately be cancelled, and any claims denied. These cases are often taken to court, too, as it is classed as insurance fraud, with outcomes including fines of up to pound, and six points on your license.. Using more miles than you thoughtYour annual mileage is one of the main factors used to calculate your insurance premium the higher the mileage, the higher the cost. Itrsquos important to be as accurate as possible when providing this figure, rather than just guessing, as itrsquos possible your insurance provider will decide not to pay a claimyour mileage is higher than what yoursquove estimated. When working out how many miles you drive, donrsquot forget to include weekends away, weekly shopping, etc, and add some contingency miles - itrsquos better to be safe than sorry!. Driving with petsIf you are driving with your pet in the car, you are legally required to make sure they are secured. Unsecured pets can make a car more at risk of accidents, as they may distract the driver or even physically get in the way of driving. If you crash with an unsecured pet in the car, itrsquos likely that your insurance company will refuse to pay for your claim.. Letting other people drive your carWhile itrsquos possible for your friends or family to have insurance policies that allow them to drive other peoplersquos cars, it is unlikely these policies cover damage to the vehicle in the event they are in an accident. Itrsquos more than likely that your own policy only covers vehicle damage that happens when a named driver is in the car, so while your friend can legally drive it, any accidents that occur may not be able to be claimed for.. Yoursquove recently changed jobsYour current occupation is one of the factors used to determine your risk profile, so itrsquos important to update your insurance companyyou have changed jobs or occupations. Failure to do so many mean any claims made after a job change can be denied by your insurer.. Charging for ltsSome policies specically exclude cover for car sharing, whether you make profit or not.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility. Since then, little progress has been made.“What has happened, however, is that the ferries operating these leline routes have got older, less reliable and more costly to run. Despite the best efforts of crews, we have seen increasing levels of disruption, including the ongoing problems with the MV Eynhallow. This situation is simply not sustainable and needs to be addressed.“Scottish Government needs to agree a clear timetable for taking forward the procurement of replacement vessels so that communities in Orkney have the leline services they deserve. I will be following this up with the Minister.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.” Responding to the murders of at least nine people in Hanau, Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were clear signs that the killer had been motivated by racism.Merkel, of the centre-right CDU party, has been described by some as the new ‘leader of the free world’ because of her strong stance against the sinister ideology espoused by those such as the far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Echoing Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he has declared “the age of liberal democracy is at an end” on the grounds that it is no longer able to “provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture”. Normally the US President is the unofficial leader of the free world, but Donald Trump, quite accurately, views Orban as “probably like me”.: Andrew Sabisky: what the former No.  adviser is alleged to have said about pregnancies, eugenics and race as he steps down: Boris Johnson is not a ‘real racist’ despite Brits criticism, says Home Secretary Priti PatelFor Orban, the Christian culture of Europe is under threat from “Muslim invaders” and there is, and always will be, a great iding line between these two religions. He is right about one thing, but wrong about everything .There is indeed a iding line that separates human beings, not just in Europe, but all over the world. On one side of this line are groups like Isis but also far-right killers such as one in Hanau another who massacred  people in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year and the man who killed  people in attacks in Oslo and the island of Utoya in Norway in .The fascists may view the ‘Islamofascists’ as their deadly enemies, but they are fundamentally the same. Disagree with them too much and they will kill you belong to the wrong group and they will kill you.On the other side are the vast majority of people – of all religions and none – who are decent, peace-loving and respectful of others’ basic right to exist.Racism and other forms of bigotry are ideological mechanisms, societal poisons, that can persuade people to cross this line into a le of violence, murder and death.So , on playing a word association game, you say “terrorist” on hearing “Muslim”, beware, because you are heading in a dangerous direction.The basic premise of liberalism – the prevailing philosophy of all true democracies – is that each and every one of us is an inidual. It is, therefore, the antidote to the poison of prejudice.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how to stay rational about coronavirus in the face of panic dr antonis kousoulis","story":"The Covid- coronavirus outbreak may feel scary to some, but it is important to retain a sense of perspective and seek out reputable sources of information, writes Dr Antonis Kousoulis.The UK is a bit on edge at the moment. Following hot on the heels of Brexit, we’ve seen weather challenges, and a news agenda dominated by the Covid- coronavirus outbreak. It’s fair to say public health and climate related emergencies are only likely to become more frequent in the next few years, as environmental and human challenges become more pressing.In the case of the coronavirus, we don’t know yet what will happen.The very best scientists in the world are studying the virus and its impact, and responding appropriately with containment, treatment and advice. We don’t know what that will mean for the UK and the wider world - how the disease will develop, whether it will spread and what the implications will be for our ability to stay healthy, to work, to visit people and to move around freely.Uncertainty breeds concern – and several mental health helplines are getting calls about the virus. We worry about change, and about things we can’t control. There is a lot of information and advice out there, some good, and some bad. It is changing all the time, and there is a lot of fake news around. Even health organisations have often taken a very top-down approach with patronising messaging about what people should or should not be doing, instead of properly engaging with the communities that are facing the real stresses.: Man from Heriot Watt University tests negative for coronavirus after advice sent out to students: A coronavirus hoax message is circulating on WhatsApp - here’s what to doyou receive itThe situation may feel scary but panic and stress can cloud our judgement and lead to bad decisions for our health. There are things that you can do to stay mentally healthy.We need to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak. Rumour and speculation fuel anxiety. Some diseases, such as bird-flu, did not develop at all. And not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Having access to good quality and up-to-date information about the virus can help us feel more in control. You can get up-to-date information and advice on the virus from the NHS, Gov.uk, Health Protection Scotland and Public Health Wales.Find a balanceWe should all be following hygiene advice such as washing hands often, particularly after using public transport or after being in public places, using tissuesyou sneeze or cough and disposing of them, and staying at homeyou are feeling unwell.Not everything you see or hear is going to be true. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it’s important to find a balance. It’s best that you don’t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intakeit is bothering you. You might want to mute or turn off news notications or your smartphone or limit your news intake to once a day.At times of stress, we usually work better in company and with support. It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we consume news about the outbreak, especiallywe have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health, and avoid increasing habits that are not helpful, like smoking and drinking.Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. You may also like to focus on the things you can doyou feel able to: use stress management and relaxation techniques, keep active and eat a balanced diet.Rumours at schoolOur response to infectious outbreaks, like in mental ill-health, has a history of discriminating against the most vulnerable. It’s really important not to judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. Being caring and supportive improves the chances of prevention and recovery.Talk to your children and your family and reassure anyone you know who is worried. Involving family and children in plans for mental health is essential. We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. They could have picked up rumours at school. Don’t avoid the “scary topic” but engage in a way that is understandable to them. We have more advice on talking with your children about world news.All around the world, there are epidemiologists and public health doctors whose job it is to look out for patterns in disease. But as the news cycle has become -hour, and our connection to distant world events more and more immediate, there is a very real risk that real, but small threats become hyper magnied in our minds before we have the chance to work out how concerned we should actually be.The critical thing for our mental health is that we gain appropriate perspective and context – without cutting ourselves off from important public health advice.It may be that the coronavirus outbreak burns out. It may join the other four human coronaviruses as a condition which appears and disappears from time to time – or it may become a global threat to public health. Whether it is this agent, or another, there will come a time when we need to be able to receive and respond to urgent public health advice. That includes making sure that we are in our best mental health to be able to act rationally when required.Dr Antonis Kousoulis is a director at the Mental Health Foundation, a medical doctor specialist in public health and a visiting lecturer at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"family of caroline flack share unpublished instagram she wanted to post","story":"The family of Caroline Flack have released an unpublished Instagram post that the star wrote in the days before her death, in which she said that within  hours her whole world and future had been swept from under her feet.The -year-old former Love Island host, who took her own le, described the domestic incident with boyfriend Lewis Burton as \"an accident\".\"On December the th  I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend,\" she wrote. \"Within  hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed.\"I am suddenly on a dferent kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen.\"I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night.\"Even on the night.\"But the truth is ...

Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits.

There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business.

Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added. Mr Dunlop said the Relief group was in Portadown for the long haul and had a viable congregation of people in the wider Upper Bann area who were committed to the new church. “We are becoming well established,” he added.NI weather: The Met Office has updated the weather warning for Saturday while a warning for rain comes into effect for parts of NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"A Ballyclare man who slipped into a #dark place# during a bout of mental ill health is cycling across Northern Ireland#s football grounds to raise funds for Action Mental Health.

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day.

Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in . This event provoked hopeless debates in the prelude to the census in England, for example. The ‘crisis’ question was, why would the Scottish and Irish be granted an ethnicity status while the English were left out of this Well, the ethnicity question I am interested in here also brings the African to the table.•Elly Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland poll shows 454 back irish unity and 468 support union","story":" .% of respondents in the Republic would vote for Northern Ireland to be part of united IrelandFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe percentage of people in Northern Ireland who would vote for a united Ireland is almost as high as the number of those who would vote to remain the UK, according to a new poll.

In both Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland polls, which took place between January  and February , a majority of respondents said they supported a referendum on Irish unity within the next decade. Responding to the results, Professor Colin Harvey of Queen#s University Belfast said it looks like support for the current constitutional arrangements is on a kne-edge. That is simply remarkable. It shakes the legitimacy of the foundations of the existing constitutional order, he said. Meanwhile, the poll also shows the number of people opposed to the current Brexit arrangements has increased since the  referendum, when .% of Northern Ireland voted to remain part of the European Union and .% voted to leave.When asked on Brexit Day, January , .% of respondents in Northern Ireland said they were not satisfied with the current Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. .% said they were happy, while .% said they didn#t know.

On each occasion there has not been adequate cover for shts within the Ambulance Service the public are at increased risk. A separate Assembly question from Mr Givan found huge overtime costs to plug gaps in the Ambulance Service#s rotas. Some £,, was spent to cover additional hours in the last three years.Mr Givan added: I welcome the Executive putting our health service at the top of its priorities and reform must be made across a wide range of issues.Progress has been made in dealing with the pay dispute but health service reform is a major but necessary task and will only be achieved through support from all sides of the Assembly.Last summer ambulance crews had to be drafted from the Republic of Ireland to help cover major staff shortages.During one weekend in August, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service was down by about  crews - roughly a quarter of its normal workforce.According to the Ambulance Service, reduced levels of cover are mainly due to factors such as staff vacancies, rostered leave and sickness absences. It said that whenever it has not been possible to provide full cover, contingency plans have been instigated to mitigate against an adverse impact on patients.Calls received in ambulance control are prioritised to ensure that the quickest response is provided to the most seriously ill or injured, a spokesman said. He said demand has increased signicantly in recent years without a corresponding increase in ambulance resources.The spokesman said the service is working to address staff shortages and fill existing vacancies with ongoing regional recruitments and training.He said over  additional operational staff will be required to meet demand and achieve response time targets. Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield acknowledged the problems caused by unfilled shts on the public and staff.It is a source of regret to me whenever ambulance cover is depleted due to lack of available resources and the potential impact this may have on the community we serve, he said.I am mindful that as a result of reduced staffing levels some patients wait longer for an ambulance than would otherwise be the case. We continue to prioritise the most urgent calls, but regrettably some lower urgency calls will wait longer and I apologise to patients for that.I would like to express my gratitude to those staff, on the frontline and in ambulance control, who continue to work tirelessly to ensure that an ambulance response is provided to those who have an immediate and le-threatening need.In January it was reported that the Ambulance Service had spent £.m on private ambulances in  .The ambulances - run by private firms and voluntary organisations - were sent to , emergency calls.The Red Cross, St John Ambulance and the Order of Malta are among those used to provide cover.Health union Unison said increasing private ambulance use was concerning and was indicative of problems across the health service.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland temperatures set to plummet as warning issued after snow disruption#Bomb scare# at Northern Ireland schoolCoronavirus will spread to Northern Ireland, warns medical expert as Italy confirms seventh death after European outbreakHundreds attend Sinn Fein meeting in Cork to rally support for government effortsFamily and friends pay their last respects to Naomi Lynn after fatal Co Antrim crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Derry featherweight was hoping to upset the odds when he took on British champion Ryan Walsh at the York Hall in London, live on Sky Sports, but despite starting well, lost a unanimous decision.McCullagh caused a stir last week when he arrived at the pre-match press conference with friend and fellow pro Tyrone McKenna dressed as characters from classic s comedy Dumb and Dumber. McCullagh was in the zone come fight night however and he began strongly but was eventually broken down by Walsh who sent him to the canvas twice throughout the fight. Walsh, who has defended the British title six times since  – including stoppage victories over Belfast’s James Tennyson and Marco McCullough, picked McCullagh as his opponent earlier in the week after picking the Golden Ball in a tournament which promises the winner a two-year, six-figure deal.This was always a huge challenge for McCullagh who stepped up in weight and class to take part in this tournament before cruising past Razaq Najib in the quarterfinals. McCullagh edge a cagey first round before clearly taking the second with straight shots down the middle.Keeping out of range, McCullagh continued to keep Walsh at bay in the third and looked more than comfortable in the early stages.It was much closer in the fourth with Walsh getting closer but the cleaner work came from the Irishman, who was again proving his doubters wrong.Disaster then struck for McCullagh however as the bout entered its second half as a right hook caught him and took away his legs completely. Following a stumble around the ring, he found himself flat on his back and seemingly very hurt. However, to his credit, McCullagh got back up and weathered the storm for the remainder of the round. Walsh was building momentum heading into the seventh round, but McCullagh was fighting back, showing he had recovered well from that knockdown. It all changed again at the start of the eighth round as a big right hand at the start followed by a body assault had McCullagh in trouble. It seemed the end was near but again McCullagh fought back and again made it through the round.Knowing he was now well behind on the scorecards, McCullagh attempted a spirited fightback, but all hope of a comeback was ended when he was forced to take another count, falling forward to his knees following a salvo from Walsh.McCullagh answered the bell from the tenth and managed to grit things out, with the contest going all the way to the judges who confirmed Walsh a unanimous decision winner with scores of -, -, and -. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I want any investment in roads to reflect the need across our entire network. I am pleased to announce this road improvement scheme on the Baranailt Road which represents an investment of pound, in the Claudy area. The work will signicantly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network and will serve the local community for many years to come.”The scheme will start near the junction with the Foreglen Road and proceed along Baranailt Road for a distance of . kilometres.To facilitate the resurfacing it will be necessary to operate a road closure for the duration of the work. A two way signed ersion will be available via A Foreglen Road and B Drumrane Road. Access for residents and landowners will be maintained.The Department has programmed the work and traffic management arrangements to minimise any inconvenience, however, drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Welcoming the news, East Derry SDLP MLA John Dallat said: “It’s important that our roads network, which has degraded over three years without an Executive in place, is broad back up to standard. Investing in infrastructure like this has a positive impact on the lives of local people and I’m delighted that the Minister has made East Derry an early priority.“The SDLP will continue to work hard to deliver on the issues that matter to local people.”Completion of the work by March  is dependent on favourable weather conditions a statement from the Department said.Meanwhile, resurfacing work on the Seacoast Road, Limavady is also underway.The scheme extends from near Burnally Road, Myroe for . kilometres towards Crindle, is expected to be completed by Sunday  March . The works will greatly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network.A full road closure from .am to .pm daily is currently in operation until Sunday, March .During the road closure a ersion will be in operation via Aghanloo Road - Windyhill Road - Ballykelly Road - Seacoast Road and vice versa.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchni googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Unfortunately, we dont have an Irish language secondary school yet but there has been a massive intake in the primary schools over the past  to  years,” she said.Cultuacuterlann Uiacute Chanaacutein are celebrating their thbirthday this year and it was marked with the highest intake of adult learners so far with over  learners attending classes weekly.Mayor Michaela Uiacute Bhaoil has said she is delighted to be able to launch Seachtain na Gaeilge and she is looking forward to attending as many events as she can.“Its fantastic that we have organisations like Foras na Gaeilge and Cultuacuterlann Uiacute Chanaacutein in operaton throughout the district as its so important that we promote the language.“Irish schools and organisations do amazing things on such a small budget and when you look at the children who attend Irish schools, it provides fantastic opportunities for the children and their families.”Seachtain na Gaeilge runs from March - and the full programme of events can be found atwww.derrystrabane gaeilge and Culturlann.org. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But before you know it little ‘Mary’ is three years old and you only ever see her at Christmas or on her birthday IF you have time and even then she doesn’t really know who you are.Yes you are working, yes you have your own children, yes you live an hour away etc etc BUT what happened to all those good intentions Good intentions are all well and good, butyou don’t actually do anything well they don’t actually mean anything - it’s the old excuses… could have done, would have done, will do, next time, but in fact you HAVEN’T, DIDN’T and DON’T!I love spending time with my nieces, and my great niece too. I’ve one of them to pick up at twelve o’clock today and I KNOW after she goes home I’ll be hoovering up glitter and sequins for weeks!But when I do collect her, see her as she runs to the door shouting ‘Aunty Jen’ and gives me a huge hug and big smile it makes all the glitter and sequins worthwhile, oh and all the laughing and smiling we’ll do together helps as well! It’s fab being an aunty, and I’m sure it is being an uncle and a godparent too, we can spoil them, treat them, play silly games with them - even have a go on the see saw and slide.We can enjoy going to the cinema and watching the new Disney films, visiting the farm or zoo, making popcorn and snuggling on the couch to watch cartoons, getting messy with paint , dancing around the living room and jumping on the couch to get away from the crocodilesand as they get older doing hair and make up, going on go karts or swimming - great excuse to go on that new slide in the swimming baths .There’s loads of fun to be had together so simply put,you don’t have your niece, nephew or godchild for a visit regularly YOU are the one missing out! Of course I’m not suggesting you should have them every week, every Saturday night .But maybe once every month, six weeks or couple of months for a sleep over - they’ll be so excited.I knowyou’ve got children and so has your brother, sister or friend that this may be hard for you, but maybe you could swop children for the day - then you’ll all get a chance to be that fab aunty, uncle or godparent.Or have your children and your niece, nephew or godchild too - what dference is one more child going to make.Yes parents this means you would have a babysitter but you’ve got to do it for your brother, sister or friend too! As I write quite often, their childhoods go by so fast, it’s the time with you today that creates the bond between you both - this does apply to aunts, uncles and godparents too.As our children become teenagers sometimes they need this ‘other’ trusted and loved adult in their le too - someone to talk to when times are tough, someone to be ‘on their side’, someone to help them make the right choice, a place and person of safety when things are going wrong.And this is what you promised when they were just a baby… ‘I’ll always look out for you, be there for you and be there to help you enjoy the world’.But how will they be able to do thisthey don’t know you, don’t play with you, have days out with you, or sleep overs at your house and only see you at Christmas - evenyou do bring great presents Anyway got to run, off to pick up my niece, take her to McDonald’s for lunch, then the cake shop so she can choose a special cake tor us to share after our tea, then it’s home for glueing, glitter, sequins and paint, before playing Snap, dolls and hairdressers, after that it’s be a bath bomb bath for herthen snuggles with stories before bed!No I won’t be telling her Dad about the sweets and ice cream - it’s my job to enjoy, love AND spoil her! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose.

Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar community facility unused over power supply issue  ","story":"A COMMUNITY centre in Ballykinlar is lying unused because it has no electricity supply, it emerged this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE and the MoD to address the power supply on as soon as possible.Last night the Ministry of Defence indicated that it had been working with NIE Networks and ldquoawaited confirmation of the proposed works.A spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks on the installation of a power supply for the community centre.ldquoThe MOD has a long relationship with the

Down Cathedral on Sunday afternoon, the Right Rev David McClay said Jesus Christ died on the cross for everyone and that the Church had a responsibility to teach the world of God.ldquoWe are charged to take His message out into the world, to our towns, villages, townlands and beyond, he said. ldquoWe have a responsibility to teach Godrsquos word to those who are not here today.The service was attended by clergy and lay readers from throughout the Down and Dromore diocese.Also in attendance were clergy from other denominations, including Fr John Murray, Downpatrick parish priest, and Canon Sean Rogan, a former parish priest in the town.Also present were the Rev Dr Heather Morris, a former president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and Abbot Mark-Ephraim and Fr Eric from the Benedictine Holy Cross Abbey in Rostrevor.Among the dignitaries were the Lord Lieutenant for Co Down, Mr David Lindsay,Baroness Margaret Ritchie, Strangford MP Jim Shannon, MLAs Colin McGrath and

Just  people posted comments in relation to the graffiti incident.Police suspect that the graffiti incidents took place late last Friday evening or in the early hours of Saturday and are keen for anyone who can help with their investigations to come forward.Both incidents have sparked a sharp rebuke from South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Willie Clarke.Mr McGrath said there was no place for what he described as ldquohateful graffiti in society, lsquolet alone a gable wall overlooking a graveyardrsquo.He remarked: ldquoThis is an act of vandalism and is completely unacceptable. I utterly condemn those behind this. They should be ashamed of their actions.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThose responsible do not represent the people of South Down and these actions will not be tolerated.Cllr Clarke said many people have been left ldquodisgusted at the incident.He said no one in Newcastle will condone what happened and that it was ldquoparticularly disturbing that graffiti was painted on a gable wall of a pensionerrsquos home next to a graveyard.Cllr Clarke said graveyards are sacrosanct, places where people go to pay their respects to loved ones. He said visitors attended the graves of loved ones should not have to look at graffiti.He declared: ldquoI believe that both graffiti incidents are linked and would appeal to anyone who has any information to come forward to assist police with their enquiries.ldquoI have spoken to the owner of the house at the Downs Road and she is understandably annoyed at what happened. I suspect those who responsible forthe graffiti incidents were either high or alcohol or drugs or a combination of both.ldquoNo one wants to see anything like this in Newcastle or indeed any other town or village across the district.

With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out. They have been behind us the entire way.Shane believes that he and Connor, whorsquos originally from South Devon, were meant for each other.ldquoFor me, it was definitely love at first sight. Once we got together, we became inseparable, said Shane, whorsquos a support worker for Autism Initiatives in Newcastle.ldquoI just loved Connorrsquos personality and how caring he was as a person and how he would do anything for anyone. Of course, hersquos also beautul.For Connor, who works in a Newcastle cafeacute, said he was drawn to Shanersquos ldquoopen, honest face and knew right away he was ldquoa good guy.When the two young men decided to commit to one another, they initially believed that it would be a civil partnership ceremony.Same-sex marriage was only made legal in Northern Ireland mdash in line with the rest of the UK mdash on January  as it was voted in by MPs in the House of Commons last autumn. Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple. Itrsquos a really big thing and part of Northern Irelandrsquos history so we feel privileged to be a part of it.The couple intend to make Co Down their home in the future and see themselves as parents.Shane said: ldquoWe would love to have children, whether thatrsquos by using a surrogate or by adopting, but itrsquos definitely one of the big things in our future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Storm.jpg","title":"Storm sewage deluge  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Ballynahinch have appealed for an end to what they have described as a ldquoflooding nightmare at the busy Lisburn Street junction with Main Street in the town.Persistent heavy rain swept in by Storm Dennis last Saturday left the busy Ballynahinch junction under water with traders forced to take precautions to protect their property.Storm water and raw sewage flow into a combined drain which struggles to cope when there is heavy rain, with speculation locally that a section of underground piping is blocked.Matt Comiskey, of Jordyrsquos Bar, said sewage was evident during last Saturdayrsquos deluge and revealed that while the issue has been raised with NI Water on a number of occasions, no affirmative action has been taken.He has been informed that work to address the issue will result in a section of Lisburn Street having to be dug up. He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

Hardly a surprise, of course, for a party that prioritises ‘A Nation Once Again’ above and beyond all .Hence my question, what purpose does she think is served by the Assembly  In the event that a border poll delivered the result she wanted then both Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Assembly would cease to exist. She hopes that will happen as soon as . That being the case what incentive is there for her to lay down a framework for genuine cooperation between unionism and republicanism here.Mary Lou McDonald hopes for a border poll by , then one every seven years until she gets the result she wants \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Indeed, what incentive is there for unionism – even the ‘moderate’ elements – to lay down a framework for genuine cooperation when it, too, knows that Sinn Fein has no long-termin the existence of either the Assembly or Northern Ireland  And evena border poll in the next few years failed to deliver for her, I can’t imagine Sinn Fein would interpret the result as a mandate to start prioritising a successful, ing, genuinely power-sharing Assembly.McDonald would, obviously, point the finger of blame at the DUP, citing the contents of Martin McGuinness’s resignation letter in January : ‘The equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP. Apart from the negative attitude to nationalism and to the Irish identity and culture, there has been a shameful disrespect towards many other sections of our community. Women, the LGBT community and ethnic minorities have all felt this prejudice. And for those who wish to love their lives through the medium of Irish, elements of the DUPhave exhibited the most crude and crass bigotry.’Yet the DUPcould just as easily point the finger at Sinn Fein, citing the tendency of McDonald and other senior figures to commemorate and celebrate the lives of IRA members the tendency of some Sinn Fein to shout ‘Up the Ra’ or ‘Tiocfaidh ár lá’ on any and every occasion and, as stated in a paramilitary assessment report in  and referenced again in the last couple of weeks, the IRA Army Council still exists and ‘oversees both PIRA and Sinn Fein with an overarching strategy’. Indeed, at the end of January Conor Murphy did nothing to deny the conclusions of the report, merely saying: “If there was a crisis tomorrow morning, I don’t doubt we would draft in a team to try to manage our response to it. The team would involve a range of people including elected and non-elected representatives.”Shortly before that report was published the UUP had already withdrawn from the Executive , with then UUP leader Mike Nesbitt confirming: “We are walking out of the Executive because we cannot sit with Sinn Fein because we do not trust them.”Responding to the Army Council’s ongoing influence when the report was publishedhe noted: ‘This blows a hole in SF’s argument. They demand we respect their political mandate, but they now need to make clear the extent to which that mandate is shaped by a group ofunnamed shadowy figures who in the past have overseen the most lethal terrorist force on the planet.” I’m not entirely sure what has happened in the meantime to convince the UUP that ato the Executive was justied.Anyway, at the heart of the present relationship between unionism and republicanismis a deep, ever-widening lake of toxicity. Whatever Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill may say in public about the willingness to work together and to cooperate for the good of Northern Ireland, the inescapable, unavoidable fact remains that genuine cooperation is not possible between them. They rejoined the Executive for mutually contradictory reasons a month ago and they remain in it for mutually contradictory reasons.In the run-up to Northern Ireland’s centenary in , Foster will push something which she describes as a ‘New Generation Unionism’ project, while Sinn Feinwill turbo-charge its longstanding ‘unity project’. As I say, those projects are mutually contradictory and being mutually contradictory makes it impossible for both parties to meet in the middle. Which is why they aren’t even trying.So – and the question now applies to both Sinn Fein and the DUP – what purpose is served by a rebooted Assembly  It gave the DUP a ‘position of influence’ to replace the one it lost in Westminster in December. Sinn Fein wanted to be able to signal to a broader electorate in the Republic that it is capable of a coalition with the most unlikely partners.

Some of the volunteer workers from ious countries assigned to this duty dreaded the ominous ‘pancake day’ as it often had its share of disasters, giving them the in-house nickname of ‘panic cakes’! In the ious hotel and catering establishments I have worked in over the years, eventhey were secular, there was always the obligatory ‘Pancake Day’ or ‘Shrove Tuesday,’ even though the tradition is linked to the fasting of Lent that begins the following day on Ash Wednesday observed by Protestant and Catholic denominations as a precursor to Easter.

It was a day to use up eggs, milk and other rich foods before the  day fasting period. This gave rise to the name ‘carnival’ coming from the Latin ‘carnem lee’and for others ‘Mardi Gras’ meaning ‘Fat Tuesday.’ Pope Gregoryissued the following rule to Augustine in Canterbury: “We abstain from flesh, meat, and from all things that come from flesh, as milk, cheese and eggs.” Ash is still daubed on the foreheads of participants on Ash Wednesday in some denominations from burnt palm fronds made into crosses from the previous year, almost reminiscent of some religious practices in India, but which was linked to the time of penitence and confession. I have never panicked making pancakes, but I do question whether Jesus would actually require this practice from anyone who chooses to follow Him  Certainly there were no such traditions in the early church. Jesus fasted in the wilderness for us. We don’t need to do it ourselves. Fasting can come freely at any time of the year, but not by ecclesiastical obligation. Besides, following Him and not religious traditions invented by men is the best recipe for success in my book.Colin Nevin, Chef, Israel -"},{"url":null,"title":"meaning shrove tuesday and idea self denial easily overlooked time great comfort ","story":"Unionist trio seek details of Raymond McCord legal aidArmy veteran who took his own le a ‘victim of the IRA’NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionThe meaning of Shrove Tuesday and the idea of self denial is easily overlooked in a time of great comfortAs plenty of schoolchildren will know, today is Pancake Tuesday.By The NewsroomTuesday, th February , : am\"\"News Letter editorialFor as long as the oldest people alive can remember, it has been a happy tradition of making and flipping and, best of all, eating pancakes.At a time of declining Christian influence, not so many young people will know that Pancake Tuesday is Shrove Tuesday, just as children often know more about Christmas presents than they do about the meaning of December .The making of pancakes or other foods or the partaking of celebrations, such as in Brazil as pictured on the opposite page, in its famous Carnival celebrations, or Mardi Grasin New Orleans, was a final period of indulgence ahead of a lean spell of self denial and austerity.In the letter, right, one of our regular reader contributors Colin Nevin questions whether fasting is in fact a necessary Christian tradition. Certainly some churches place greater store by it than others. But evenit is deemed a man-made ritual for which there is no religious justication, now more than ever there is a case to be made for periods of abstinence. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The pupils were then asked to redesign the maps by using their knowledge of the local area. They identied key landmarks, short cuts and potential barriers to walking and cycling.The pupils also developed a set of symbols and a map key which will be used in the new map.Sustrans also held a parent engagement workshop where they invited families to identy routes that they and their children use.Sustrans will produce a bilingual pocket-sized travel map which will be available to students, staff and parents for free. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
