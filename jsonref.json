The pup was looked after by presenter John Noakes, until the pooch\u0027s death in 1971. Blue Peter then introduced Shep to its studios, arguably the most beloved of the brood to date. The Border Collie was the long-time companion of Noakes following the death of Patch, and the pair were inseparable.

As became tradition, her name was chosen by viewers.Goldie was the first in a long line of Golden Retrievers to appear on the show, including one of her puppies, Bonnie, who joined in 1986.The new mother left the show shortly after giving birth, and went to live with Groom on his Derbyshire farm.Bonnie then took up the mantle - and appeared with 16 different presenters on 1,150 editions of Blue Peter.The show\u0027s second Border Collie, Mabel, joined the show when she was just six months old in 1996, after being rescued by the RSPCA in south London.She became the longest serving pet since Petra, and was recognisable for having heterochromatic eyes (one blue and one brown) and distinctive ears.Mabel frequented the show alongside Lucy, a pedigree Golden Retriever who joined in 1998.Both Mabel and Lucy passed away within a month of each other in 2011, having served on the show for 14 and 12 years respectively.

A suite, where Kate is believed to have given birth, is thought to cost closer to £7,500.How much does the baby weigh?The baby weighs 8lbs and 9oz, just two ounces more than his cousin, Prince Louis. In fact, Pippa’s son is heavier than all of his Royal cousins, with George weighing in at 8lbs 6oz and Princess Charlotte at 8lbs 3oz.Until Louis was born, George was the heaviest future king in 100 years, and while Louis has taken that title from his older brother, Pippa’s son can boast that he in turn is heavier than him.Pippa’s son is much heavier than his uncles, with Prince William hitting 7lbs 1.5oz back in 1982 and Prince Harry coming in at 6lbs 14oz in 1984.What will the baby be called?No name has been announced so far, but a couple of the names Pippa and her husband James could go for are their father’s names: Michael and David respectively.Who is Pippa Middleton’s husband James Matthews?Pippa’s husband is the financier James Matthews. They married in May 2016. He is the older brother of the former Made in Chelsea star, Spencer Matthews. Matthews had another brother, Michael, who died at the age of 22 while descending Everest, at the time becoming the youngest Brit to scale the mountain.Matthews runs Eden Rock Capital Management and his family owns the Eden Rock resort in St. Barths.James Matthews’s net worth is estimated to be as much as $2.6 billion (£2 billion), according to The Net Worth—much more than his spouse\u0027s. Pippa’s engagement ring reportedly cost £200,000 while the couple’s honeymoon came to £120,000.Dancing With the Stars 2018 spoilers: Who will be the winner?EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Tuesday, October 16Pink Tour 2019: Beautiful Trauma dates, tickets and more detailsBTS: Weird conspiracy theories about the K-pop groupFortnite solo tournament: All you need to knowLady Gaga engaged: All you need to know about her fiance Christian CarinoHow to watch the NBA in the UKWill Pippa Middleton\u0027s baby boy get a Royal title?Pippa Middleton baby: Name, weight, pictures, Royal title and moreAnt McPartlin and Lisa Armstrong orce: Former couple\u0026#8217s relationship timelineWorld Food Day: All you need to knowChance the Rapper went undercover as a Lyft driver to raise money for Chicago Public SchoolsJennifer Aniston is helping Selena Gomez after she was hospitalized for mental breakdownSpecial Edition Diablo 3 Bundle for Nintendo Switch announcedMeghan Markle pregnant: Royal baby traditions the Duchess will have to followThe Conners: What time is the premiere and how does Roseanne die?Fortnite will be the most popular Halloween costume in 2018Dancing With the Stars trio week: Who will be joining the couples?Michael Buble net worth revealed as singer quits music"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/15/11/0772ADDE000003E8-0-Missing_journalist_Jamal_Khashoggi_pictured_in_Switzerland_in_20-m-94_1539600462690.jpg","title":"US mercenaries hired assassinate politicians clerics Middle East","story":"    Two former US Navy SEALs were said to be among the mercenaries hired to carry out the attack          Drone footage of the attack obtained by Buzzfeed News shows the bombing attack unfoldingThe plan was to place a bomb at the door of its headquarters in Aden, but drone footage of the attack obtained by Buzzfeed showed that it went wrong.Before the mercenary could plant the bomb, one of his team opened fire - it\u0027s not clear at what - and the team was forced to retreat without proof of the kill.\u0027There was a targeted assassination program in Yemen.

This would be a constitutional affront.It is not just Northern Irish unionists who oppose it. So does Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland: they know that any weakening of the ties that bind Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK would be exploited by separatists peddling Scottish independence. We cannot leave the European Union in a way that threatens the much more ancient and precious Union of these four great nations.During the course of the summer, it became clear to me that the so-called Irish backstop promised national humiliation and would never get through Parliament.But you can’t beat a plan with no plan. So I set myself the challenge of devising a workable Plan B, one that would deliver our exit from the European Union next March in accordance with the people’s vote in the 2016 referendum, protect people’s jobs and incomes by securing the benefits of continuing tariff-free access to the Single Market, and – crucially – command the support of a majority of MPs.Very simply, it involves the UK leaving the EU on March 29, 2019, and, for an interim phase only, moving to a position like Norway’s in what is called the European Economic Area (EEA). That’s the Common Market that integrates the economies of countries in the EU with those of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.We would be inside the Single Market (as most businesses want) but outside the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy, and outside the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.              Leader of the Scottish conservatives Ruth Davidson is opposed to anything which could leave Northern Ireland in a different trading arrangement than the rest of the UK as this would encourage the SNP to seek a second independence referendumWe would need to join the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) – of which the UK was a member before we joined the EU, and which negotiates free trade agreements for Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein – as either a full member or an associate member. And we would need to agree continuity in our customs arrangements for the interim period.From this halfway house, we would negotiate a long-term economic relationship based on a Canada-style Free Trade Agreement, as has been proposed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and others.Since the beginning of September, I have been meeting with MPs of all persuasions – passionate Brexiteers, committed Remainers and unbending Unionists – and I have been struck by the response. Nobody loves the ‘Norway then Canada’ approach – but, crucially, everyone can find some things they like about it, and most of them can see how they might be able to swallow those bits they like less, if they are offered other assurances and guarantees.For Remainers, having continuity on the Single Market and on customs for this interim period appeals because it secures the position of vital industries like car manufacturers and aerospace companies, whose businesses are based on the fluid import and export of parts between different European countries.For Leavers, dumping the permanent subjugation to EU legislation promised by the Prime Minister’s Chequers plan, and instead committing to a Canada-style Free Trade Agreement as the format for our long-term economic relationship, offers the prospect of a real Brexit, in which the UK eventually takes back control of our money, our borders and our laws.For Unionists, my plan offers an absolute guarantee that all parts of the UK will move through the different stages together, that all will benefit from continuity on the Single Market and customs in the Norway phase, and that all will leave the Single Market and the customs union together when we are ready. I believe this plan – which won the very significant endorsement of former foreign secretary William Hague on Monday – has the potential to unite the Conservative Party, and indeed the country.But I don’t want to pretend that achieving a consensus will be easy, or that the Brexiteer lion is going to lay down with the Remainer lamb, and start singing Kumbaya in sweet harmony. Committed Leavers are worried that life alongside Norway in EEAEFTA will prove too cosy and comfortable – that Parliament will lose the will to move out into the bracing winds outside the Single Market and the customs union.We will only win their support for this plan if the Government is wholly committed to negotiating a looser economic relationship based on a Canada-style free trade agreement, and implementing it before the 2022 election so that Labour doesn’t have a chance to stop it.We may need to pass legislation enshrining that commitment – and to get the country ready to leave the EEA without a free trade agreement if the EU refuses to play ball.Having scuppered one Brexit deal by insisting on an eternal lock on Northern Ireland’s future, it would be an extraordinary act of self-harm for the EU to scupper this deal – one that delivers all of their objectives – by insisting on the same.We should also be straight with the British people. In the halfway house alongside Norway, we would still be subject to a version of freedom of movement – although we would have some wriggle room to restrict it to people with job offers, and even to impose a temporary brake if numbers get out of control.That is one of the main reasons why it would not be acceptable for the halfway house to become the UK’s permanent home. People voted to end freedom of movement, and we must not let them down.On her return from this evening’s EU summit, the Prime Minister has an opportunity to make a clean break and a fresh start. She should acknowledge that despite her best endeavours she has not been able to reach an acceptable agreement with the EU on her Chequers plan, and that she will now come to Parliament with a proposal for a staged withdrawal via the EEA and EFTA. Most MPs would be relieved. Business leaders would applaud. European leaders would grumble about the wasted time and effort, but they would welcome our embrace of an off-the-shelf arrangement with which they are already familiar.I believe it is Theresa May’s destiny to be the Prime Minister who delivers Brexit in a way that preserves the UK’s prosperity, constitutional integrity and position in the world.

Other past badly-hit areas have included the Home Counties, due to London overspill, and big cities such as Birmingham. The last five years have seen a 12 per cent rise in applicants to secondary schools and the intake in 2019 will be the largest in decades.Mrs Coatman added: ‘The demographic bulge, the result of the highest birth rates since the 1970s, has been anticipated for many years but the slow trickle of new schools and expansions has failed to provide enough places which match parents’ expectations.’For autumn 2018 entry, one in six children missed out on their chosen secondary place, with the proportion rising for the fifth year in a row.

Too many\u0027.Both Harry and Meghan have spoken openly about wanting to start a family.The topic cropped up in their engagement interview, with Harry, saying: \u0027Hopefully we\u0027ll start a family in the near future.\u0027The pair are also known for their warm, caring approach when meeting youngsters on official visits.Even the duchess\u0027s father Thomas Markle, whom she is believed not to have spoken to since her wedding, said he expected children soon.Mr Markle is not believed to have been told the news in advance of today\u0027s announcement.He told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain in an interview a month after the duke and duchess married: \u0027She\u0027s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there\u0027s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon.\u0027Announcing their baby news Kensington Palace said today: \u0027Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.

The Royal couple arrived on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, for their first major international tour since their world-stopping nuptials.They shunned a private jet to travel on flight Qantas flight QF2 from London via Singapore.The couple were in the first class cabin but non-royal passengers were also with them with one saying they were heard saying how \u0027excited\u0027 they were to be travelling to Australia. With them was their entourage of 10 staff members, including press secretaries and a hairdresser, and several more security staff. Royal fans already suspected the Duchess was pregnant after she wore a suspiciously wide-fitting Givenchy coat to Princess Eugenie\u0027s royal wedding on Friday.Many TV viewers were sure they could see a baby-bump beneath her long, navy blue coat as the Duchess was whisked into St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor by her doting husband. The couple held hands when they arrived in Sydney early on Monday morning on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore.Meghan was wearing her favourite Sarah Flint heels, which she teamed with the two tone coat she wore in a photo of her and Harry posing with the official 2018 Invictus Games flag last week.Earlier she sparked a storm of pregnancy speculation after she touched down in Sydney clutching two purple folders in front of her stomach.Meghan Markle was seen holding the items in her right arm as she stepped off the plane on Monday morning with Prince Harry, leaving fans of the Royal couple guessing what information they could contain. For many, the folders added to speculation Meghan Markle is expecting a baby, fuelling the fire already stoked by the large blue coat she wore at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding last week. The couple returned to their own wedding venue at Windsor Castle on Friday but missed a lavish second day of celebrations on Saturday because of their flight to Australia.            Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are pictured arriving at Admiralty House in Sydney\u0027s Kirribilli as keen Royal watchers look on          The motorcade carrying Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, makes its way through peak hour traffic on Sydney\u0027s Eastern Distributor on Monday morningBritish man Marc Sutton snowboarding and biking in his spare timeMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboAdorable moment Harry and Meghan receive hug from young childMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Harry and Meghan drive to the Airport as they set off for DubboHarry and Meghan touch down in the country town of DubboKent Police raid properties and arrest 200 in drugs crackdownPrince Harry helps speaker swat flies off her faceMeghan Markle greets fans outside the Sydney Opera HouseBercow calls for independent investigation into bullying allegationsFirst trailer for Peter Jackson\u0027s They Shall Not Grow Old    Prince Harry appeared to take some time out on Monday during his trip to Admiralty House, spotted perched on a step alongside a man believed to be a security guard (pictured)          Flying from London to Sydney is a tiring journey, but The Duchess of Sussex was in the best possible cabin for the 23-hour trip – first class in a Qantas A380 (file picture).It\u0027s a state-of-the-art aircraft with in-built anti-jet-lag technology.It produces 50 per cent less cabin noise than a 747 and has cabin air pressure that\u0027s equivalent to an altitude of 1,500 metres (5,000ft). The 747\u0027s is 2,500 metres (8,000ft).Plus, cabin air is recycled every two minutes to keep the atmosphere fresh.Then there\u0027s the Qantas touch.Meghan would have been in an \u0027expansive armchair\u0027 that converts to a fully flat bed.Cabin crew would have given her a pillow menu, a 100 per cent cotton woven throw, a duvet and a memory foam mattress. And cotton pyjamas with matching slippers.She would also have been able to enjoy an in-seat massage at the touch of a button and pressed another one to lower and raise the window blinds.It\u0027s definitely an aircraft fit for pregnant royalty.                                                      They will spend a week in the country and then on Tuesday, October 23 they will head to Fiji for two days and then on to Tonga before returning to Australia.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31. \u0027The programme across these four Commonwealth countries will focus on youth leadership, environmental and conservation efforts, including the dedication of several new Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy projects, and the recovery and rehabilitation of servicemen and women through the Invictus Games Sydney 2018,\u0027 the palace said in a short statement when announcing the tour itinerary.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will attend 76 engagements across the four countries, including the Invictus Games in Sydney, which runs from October 20 and October 28.Prince Harry founded the sporting event, which gives sick and injured service personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball, in 2014.The couple will mark the games\u0027 launch and closing ceremony. And to officially welcome the Invictus Games to the city, Prince Harry, prime minister Scott Morrison and athletes will scale the Sydney Harbour Bridge to plant the Invictus flag. Among the other highlights of their tour will be a visit to the world-renowned Taronga Zoo, in Sydney, where they will meet two koalas and their joeys. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the zoo with Prince George during their royal tour in 2014.Elsewhere the couple will visit Australian farmers struck by drought. The couple\u0027s arrival in Australia comes just days after they attended the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank where they told close family their happy news.   Revealed: How Meghan and Harry\u0027s baby will be SEVENTH in line to the throne - but WON\u0027T be a prince or princessThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s child will be seventh-in-line to the British throne. The child will come behind his or her father Prince Harry in the line of succession, bumping his uncle, the Duke of York, further down the line into eighth place.  However the child will not be given the title of prince or princess unless the Queen steps into change the rules.

The baby will bump Harry\u0027s uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession.Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and 10th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queen\u0027s youngest son - drops out of the top 10 for the first time to 11th in line.How will the baby be related to the Queen?The baby will be a great-grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales\u0027s grandchild and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s niece or nephew.Will he or she ever be monarch?Unlikely. The baby will have three cousins Prince George - a future king - and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, who are further up the line of succession, so it is a safe bet that throne will stay on the Cambridge side of the family.What will the baby be called?William and Kate chose royal favourites for their children.But will Harry and American-born Meghan go classic or break the royal mould when naming their baby?If they stay traditional, something like Alice, Mary, Elizabeth or Victoria for a girl, and James, Philip, Frederick or Arthur for a boy are possibilities.In the US, the most popular name for a baby girl is Emma and Liam for a baby boy.Will the baby be a prince or princess?No they will not be a prince nor a princess, nor an HRH because George V limited titles within the Royal Family in 1917.So what will their title be?A son would be known as Earl of Dumbarton - because a first son of a duke is allowed to use one of his father\u0027s other lesser titles as a courtesy title.Harry was also made the Earl of Dumbarton on the morning of his wedding, as well as being given a dukedom.A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.But the Queen could change this?Yes. The Queen stepped in ahead of George\u0027s birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridges\u0027 children had fitting titles, but this royal baby is much further down the line of succession.Will Harry and Meghan hire a nanny?Harry has been close to all his nannies and it is likely he and Meghan will arrange for a nanny to care for their baby while they are on official engagements Kate and William have the help of their full-time live-in nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. But Meghan\u0027s mother Doria has been seen attending baby care classes, suggesting that she may move to the UK to help out. When and where will the baby be born?Kate had three successful deliveries at the private Lindo Wing in St Mary\u0027s Hospital, Paddington, so Meghan might follow her sister-in-law\u0027s lead. Harry was also born there in 1984. It is close to Kensington Palace and well practised at dealing with royal births, and the publicity surrounding them. But Meghan could do down a different path and have a home birth. Will the baby have dual citizenship?Harry and Meghan could apply for their child to have dual US-UK citizenship. Meghan is planning to become a British citizen - but it is not known whether she will hold dual nationality, and at present is still a US citizen.Kensington Palace announced today the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant with her first child. The baby is expected in Spring next year. The happy news was announced hours after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Sydney for their first major international tour since their wedding in May.A Kensington Palace said: \u0027Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.\u0027Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.\u0027The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were told in person at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday.  Rumours were rife that Meghan may be pregnant after her mother Doria Ragland was seen taking baby-care classes in Pasadena with a view to looking after her new grandchild. The duchess has also been seen in a number of looser-fitting outfits over recent weeks.  The new royal baby is expected to take the surname Sussex in the same way that Prince William\u0027s children, George, Charlotte and Louis have taken his title Cambridge as their last name at school and nursery. The baby will supersede Prince Andrew in the line of succession, regardless of whether they are a boy or a girl, following a 2011 change in law that granted the same status to sons and daughters.However as the second son of the current Prince of Wales, Harry\u0027s children are not automatically given the title of prince or princess.King George V - Harry\u0027s great great grandfather - limited titles within the royal family in 1917.This means Harry and Meghan\u0027s first born, as a great-grandchild of the sovereign, is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH.George V declared that: \u0027the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.\u0027The eldest son and heir apparent of a duke can use one of his father\u0027s lesser grade peerage titles by courtesy, according to Debrett\u0027s.So a first son of Harry\u0027s would become Earl of Dumbarton - one of the subsidiary titles Harry received from the Queen on the morning of his wedding. A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor, and any subsequent sons Lord (first name) Mounbatten-Windsor.But the Queen could make changes to allow Harry and Meghan\u0027s children to be HRHs and princes and princesses.Ahead of Prince George\u0027s birth, the monarch issued a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridge children had fitting titles.Without this Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would have been a Lady and a Lord instead, but Prince George, as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, would still have been a prince.The Queen could decide to do the same for Harry and Meghan\u0027s baby.  The Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s children Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Viscount Severn are actually entitled to be a princess and prince as children of the son of the sovereign.But the couple decided, with the Queen\u0027s agreement, that their children would use the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an earl rather than the style prince or princess.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement in November 2017, shortly after confirming their relationship. The couple married at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, in May this year.   Is Fergie\u0027s tweetstorm a swipe at Meghan for upstaging Eugenie with baby news at her wedding?

Equinoxes are when the day and night are equal in length, meaning that the whole planet will get 12 hours of lightness and darkness on an equinox.The term equinox comes from the Latin ‘equi’, which means equal, and ‘nox’, which means night.Spring is set according to the date of the spring equinox, which falls on March 20, 2019, with the season ending on the day of the summer solstice, June 21.The summer solstice marks the longest day of the year, where the Northern Hemisphere gets the most amount of sunlight in the year.Because equinoxes and solstices are related to the Earth’s tilted axis and orbit around the sun, they are not fixed.Therefore, the spring equinox can fall at any point around March 20 and March 21, thus explaining why the first day of spring 2019 will not be the same as the first day of Spring in 2007 (March 21).Dancing With the Stars 2018 spoilers: Who will be the winner?EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Tuesday, October 16Pink Tour 2019: Beautiful Trauma dates, tickets and more detailsBTS: Weird conspiracy theories about the K-pop groupFortnite solo tournament: All you need to knowLady Gaga engaged: All you need to know about her fiance Christian CarinoHow to watch the NBA in the UKWill Pippa Middleton\u0027s baby boy get a Royal title?Pippa Middleton baby: Name, weight, pictures, Royal title and moreAnt McPartlin and Lisa Armstrong orce: Former couple\u0026#8217s relationship timelineWorld Food Day: All you need to knowChance the Rapper went undercover as a Lyft driver to raise money for Chicago Public SchoolsJennifer Aniston is helping Selena Gomez after she was hospitalized for mental breakdownSpecial Edition Diablo 3 Bundle for Nintendo Switch announcedMeghan Markle pregnant: Royal baby traditions the Duchess will have to followThe Conners: What time is the premiere and how does Roseanne die?Fortnite will be the most popular Halloween costume in 2018Dancing With the Stars trio week: Who will be joining the couples?Michael Buble net worth revealed as singer quits music"},{"url":null,"title":"Lily Allen joins Corbynistas claiming royal baby conspiracy","story":"    Echoing comments from supporters of the Labour leader on social media, Lily Allen tweeted this morning: \u0027That should take the heat off Brexit Shambles for a week.

The royals climbed aboard a water transfer - Admiral Hudson flying the White ensign of the Royal Australian Navy - after the visit to Taronga Zoo for a 20 minute crossing of the harbour to the Sydney Opera house          After their zoo visit, the couple strolled down a walkway towards Sydney Harbour to take a boat towards from the Man O\u0027War Steps, the landing point for British and Australian fleets for 150 years            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped out in Australia today for the first day of engagements during their tour - which coincided with Meghan announcing she was pregnant. Meghan was seen wearing Diana\u0027s butterfly earrings and bracelet as she and Harry made their way down to the Man O\u0027War steps to take a boat across Sydney Harbour          Meghan and Harry chat as they watch the modern dance inside the Sydney Opera House on the first full day of their Aussie tour          The royal couple watched a rehearsal at the Sydney Opera House of Spirit 2018 by the Bangarra Dance Theatre, an internationally acclaimed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander modern dance company          Bangarra tour their dance shows across Australia and have also performed in London and New York    Overjoyed: Meghan arriving in Sydney yesterday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced todayPrince Harry is ‘happier than he has ever been’ as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an ‘emotional wreck - but in a good way!’ since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.‘It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn’t be happier. He is so protective of her,’ the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week.Meghan, 37, is understood to have just had her 12-week scan. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie’s wedding. It sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who has made no secret of his desire to start a family.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, toward the end of July, conceived their first child.In the middle of that month, they were on a ‘mini-moon’ royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry’s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.                                                    As they clasped hands Harry, 34, said: \u0027I was looking for you earlier and hoped you\u0027d be here, it\u0027s so good to see you again.\u0027Harry immediately looked round his shoulder and scanned the crowd for his wife, keen to introduce her to his special fan.Soon enough, the Duchess - who had been warmly greeted by hundreds of well wishers congratulating the couple on her pregnancy - approached Ms Dunne, knelt down and hugged her.War widow Daphne\u0027s first husband, Lieutenant Albert Chowne, died aged 25 in 1945 during an attack on a Japanese machine gun post in Papua New Guinea.He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross which Mrs Dunne was wearing when she first met Prince Harry.Meghan said: \u0027I\u0027m so glad I got to meet you. Harry has told me all about you and your special bond, it\u0027s so lovely you came to see us, thank you.\u0027Daphne said: \u0027It was lovely to meet the Duchess Meghan. Harry is a wonderful man and I\u0027m so happy he had found happiness, they both deserved the absolute world together.\u0027Asked if this time was the most special meeting her hero Harry, Daphne said: \u0027We\u0027ll it was certainly different. He\u0027s married now for a start and he looks very happy. I am over the moon for him. She is a wonderful girl.\u0027I congratulated them on their baby and said I wished them all the happiness they deserve.\u0027Before leaving, Meghan told her: \u0027Hopefully next time we\u0027ll have our little one with us.\u0027 Other editable locals included sisters Hannah and Francesca Francis, 12 and 10, said they were \u0027super excited\u0027 to meet the Royal couple outside the Opera House.The schoolgirls said they had waited for three hours to just catch a glimpse of the royal couple and \u0027couldn\u0027t believe it\u0027 when the royal couple came over to speak to them.Hannah said: \u0027I told my sister we would see Meghan today but I couldn\u0027t believe it when she came over to speak to us.\u0027She was so nice and friendly and she is so pretty. She was so nice to us and said thank you for coming down to meet her.\u0027Francesca said: \u0027We were both super excited to meet Harry and Meghan I just can\u0027t believe we did.\u0027Our friends are going on be so jealous, we\u0027re going to be taking about this forever.\u0027    Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are seen meeting Ruby a mother Koala who gave birth to koala joey Meghan, named after Her Royal Highness          Prince Harry and his wife the Duchess of Sussex announced on Monday morning they are expecting their first child          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex met the tiny bears named after them when they married in May          Up close and personal: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were spotted stroking the bears at the Taronga Zoo           The Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and 20 volunteers aged 13-19 from Youth at the Zoo programme: \u0027Zoos in the 21st century, they have to modernise with everything else that\u0027s going on around them          The ten-month old joeys were wedding gifts from the people of NSW for the couple, who got married in May - and just announced they were expecting their own baby          Meghan, showing just a hint of a baby bump, cooed at the koalas before stroking them, saying: \u0027Sweet, cute\u0027 as keeper Suzie MacNamara explained how the animals are threatened in the wild          In front of hundreds of Taronga staff, donors, young volunteers and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian (second from left), Meghan used golden scissors to cut a line of green tape to open the centre          After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre          The couple was presented with a koala toy for their new baby - a hastily arranged surprise for the couple after the news of their pregnancy yesterday          Prince Harry - who has previously met koalas - was a tad more irreverent during the meeting          The then walked to the new Taronga Institute of Science and Learning holding hands, inspecting quokkas and wallabies before heading into the koala enclosure    The Duchess seemed very taken by the cuddly furballs and listened intently before asking if she could stroke them          After being invited to pet the echidna, the Duchess tentatively stroked its spines, which are used to track the animals and monitor their diet          The scientific research will allow those tackling the illegal wildlife trade to better pinpoint where animals are coming fromThe Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and 20 volunteers aged 13-19 from Youth at the Zoo programme: \u0027Zoos in the 21st century, they have to modernise with everything else that\u0027s going on around them.\u0027Taronga Zoo seems to be leading the way.

I don\u0027t think he has changed very much but I probably have. Seeing my age is going up, up, up,\u0027 she told reporter Sylvia Jeffreys.\u0027He\u0027s a natural. He just loves what he\u0027s doing but seems to fit in with everything he says. I\u0027m very happy for him.

And when he came back later, he gave me another one because I was lopsided, and I had to have another kiss to put me right.\u0027When asked where the third kiss will go, Ms Dunne laughed as she responded: \u0027I don\u0027t know, I might not even get one.\u0027       Thomas Markle, the father of the Duchess of Sussex has said he believes she will be a \u0027great mom\u0027 - but his daughter did not tell him she is pregnant            Insiders have said Prince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next Spring            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walk in the grounds of Admiralty House in Sydney on the first day of their visit to AustraliaThe announcement by Kensington Palace revealed that  Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland knew about the pregnancy and was said to be \u0027very happy\u0027. Thomas was not mentioned.  \u0027Thomas is absolutely delighted. He heard the news before it was made public and was overjoyed. He thinks Meghan will make a great mum as she is already so maternal,\u0027 said a source to The Sun. Meghan is believed to have not spoken to her father since before her wedding to Prince Harry in May after Thomas backed out at the last minute due to ill health. Her half-sister Samantha was pictured yesterday buying a congratulatory card for the couple. She told The Sun she hoped the baby would bring the family closer together. She said: \u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.\u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027             Doria Ragland, pictured with her daughter in May, said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027            Meghan is seen resting her head on Prince Harry\u0027s shoulder as the meet and greet came to an end on Tuesday afternoon            The royal couple are pictured coming down the steps of the iconic Sydney Opera House to speak with fans waiting outside      The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding (above) Thomas was spotted out and about buying groceries during which time the former Hollywood lighting director denied reports that he dabbled with using cocaine as he brought Meghan up.\u0027Never happened, no comment,\u0027 Thomas said when asked about the drug use reports. Grandfather-to-be Thomas was spotted shopping alone for groceries as Meghan and Harry were breaking news of their pregnancy to the Royal Family who he has never met.The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s father drove across the US border from his home in Rosarito, Mexico on Friday around the time his daughter and son-in-law were telling relatives at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding they were expecting their first child.Thomas appeared to be in high spirits as he was pictured buying beers, pot pies and firewood from the grocery store in San Ysidro, California.A store employee was spotted helping the 74-year-old wheel his shopping cart to his car and load his groceries into his trunk.              Prince Harry and Meghan Markle meet Findlay Blue , four, and Dasha Gallagher, six,  after they officially opened the Taronga Institute of Science and Learning at Taronga Zoo in Sydney today Meghan\u0027s mother, meanwhile, released a statement expressing her joy about the news she is set to become a grandmother for the first time.Doria Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027. Last month, Ragland was spotted taking baby-care classes in her hometown of Pasadena, California. There is a possibility she could move to London to help look after the child because Meghan may not want to hire a nanny. Kensington Palace declined to comment on whether Meghan\u0027s father was told.\u0027Thomas sees this as a chance to fix the problems between him, Meghan and Harry. He is desperate to be there for his grandchild and wants to play an active role in their life\u0027, Thomas\u0027s other daughter and Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha said to The Sun. \u0027It just makes everything that happened over the last year disappear. I want Meghan to be happy and calm and have peace. Everybody needs to be positive.\u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.  \u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027 \u0027At a proper time, there should be a sit-down wherein everyone can address this properly. Everything has to work itself out. I want to allow Meg and Harry to bring my dad into it in their own appropriate time because they very well should do. Although I can still say I love my sister, I wasn\u0027t happy with the way my father was being treated.\u0027But, you know, we\u0027re also seeing now that there was a lot going on — there may have been a lot of stress.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding. Meghan, who wed Harry just five months ago, has had her 12 week scan and is believed to be due in late April. Kensington Palace made the announcement after the couple arrived in Sydney on Monday on the eve of their 16-day major tour which will take in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  Kill him with politeness: Harry effortlessly bats away Australian serial prankster during walkabout... and for once the joker is lost for words The last time Prince Harry was in Australia, radio prankster \u0027Intern\u0027 Pete Deppeler made a fool of himself by repeatedly yelling  \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at the young royal.And it appears the KIIS FM producer didn\u0027t fare much better on Tuesday when the Duke of Sussex returned to Sydney with his pregnant wife Meghan Markle.Pete was stationed at the Opera House to cover the couple\u0027s official tour for the Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O Show, but Harry refused to humour his attention-seeking antics. A royal disaster!

Wait til you hear what Prince Harry said to crush Intern Pete\u0027s ego,\u0027 the caption teased.But fans didn\u0027t have to wait long, as another video was soon uploaded that revealed Harry\u0027s dry-witted response.    \u0027Hey Harry! Harry! Harry!\u0027 As Meghan and Harry arrived at the Sydney Opera House to meet their Australian fans, Intern Pete couldn\u0027t contain his excitement and began shouting at themAs Meghan and Harry approached the crowd of fans awaiting their arrival at the Opera House, Intern Pete couldn\u0027t contain his excitement.\u0027Hey Harry! Harry! Harry! I talk to you every year!\u0027 he breathlessly shouted.But Harry didn\u0027t show a hint of recognition and instead politely responded: \u0027Very nice to meet you\u0027.Unfortunately, Pete didn\u0027t take the hint and awkwardly reminded the visiting royal that they had actually met \u0027a few times\u0027 before.             \u0027I talk to you every year!\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t show a hint of recognition when Intern Pete (pictured) reminded him they\u0027d met beforehand, and instead politely responded: \u0027Very nice to meet you\u0027            \u0027You behave today!\u0027 Meanwhile, In another clip shared to Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O\u0027s Instagram page, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was shown scolding Intern Pete and warning him to \u0027behave\u0027            \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 In June last year, Harry and Pete had another cringeworthy encounter when the radio personality attempted to introduce him to the childhood game Hot LavaMeanwhile, In another clip shared to Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O\u0027s Instagram page, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was shown scolding Intern Pete  and warning him to \u0027behave\u0027.In June last year, Harry and Pete had another cringeworthy encounter when the radio personality attempted to introduce him to the childhood game Hot Lava.The game requires players to escape the floor by climbing on a surface within five seconds of someone yelling \u0027the floor is lava\u0027.Harry awkwardly laughed as Pete repeatedly shouted \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at him from behind a barricade. It was clear during the exchange that Harry had absolutely no idea what Intern Pete was talking about.   \u0027I\u0027ve longed for kids since I was very, very young\u0027: Heart-melting pictures that prove mischievous Harry was born to be a dadTrust Harry to cheer us up on a grey and fractious news day. Come spring, all being well, he and Meghan will have a baby.The Duchess no doubt will look wonderful cradling the child on the steps of the Lindo Wing, like her mother-in-law Diana and her sister-in-law Kate before her. But let’s come clean, it’s actually Harry we’re delighted for, isn’t it?For as these glorious pictures show, here is a boy who was born to be a dad.Our Harry, the likely lad, the mischievous redhead who didn’t think much of school but relished Army life — ‘running down a ditch full of mud, firing bullets — it’s the way I am, I love it!’.            Father material: Prince Harry cuddles baby Jean Luc in a visit to the Queen Elizabeth II Children\u0027s Hospital in Bridgetown, BarbadosThis is the larky young man who, when caught out starkers playing strip-billiards in Vegas, handsomely apologised and explained that it was just ‘a case of too much Army, and not enough prince’.But this is also a man who soberly pledged himself to his charities and duties, and founded the Invictus Games to bring respect and fun to injured servicemen.He’s our Harry. Few characters are more beguiling than a wild boy who gets into scrapes but does no real harm, then settles down to duty far more merry, open-hearted and tolerant of others than if he’d been a cautious prig all along. Hearts have ached for Harry, too, as he opened up publicly about losing his mother: about walking behind her coffin, trying for years to blank out the sorrow, at last coming to terms.            Born to be a father: Prince Harry visits 8-year old Junior Maynard in the paediatric ward at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in 2010In 2016, when he was first with Meghan, he said he hoped Diana was looking down and approving of how he and his brother turned out. He added, ‘I’m sure she’s waiting for me to have kids so she can be a grandmother again.’Earlier, a bit wistfully after a few failed courtships, he had admitted: ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young. I’m waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.’He has shown us and told us enough about himself to make us rejoice in the idea of him having a family of his own.            Happy family: Harry lifts a three-year-old orphan called Lerato during a visit to Phelisanong Children\u0027s Home in Maseru, LesothoNot least because he should be good at it: one of the vital, underestimated qualities of good parenting is that you enjoy it. A reluctant, distant or runaway dad is a sad thing to contemplate. Every woman approaching the joys and unending anxieties of motherhood is delighted to find a partner who is properly, keenly, up for it.We want a man who is not nervous of babies, enjoys the wayward comedy of toddlers, and puts shy older children at their ease. So just look at how Harry keeps proving all of those things day after day, trip after trip.            Helping hand: The 19-year-old prince plants a tree with young orphan Mutsu Potsane, 4, at the Mants\u0027ase Children\u0027s Home   in Lesotho, southern AfricaSee him cradling seven-week-old Jean-Luc in Barbados, high-fiving a young girl in Africa’s Lesotho, swinging a laughing three-year-old round like everyone’s rumbustious favourite uncle. See him lifting kids, upending them with squeals of glee, larking, pulling faces with an eight-year-old boy in hospital in Barbados, scooping up a young winner of a child bravery award (who had just asked him, ‘Where’s your crown?’) or holding hands and planting a tree with a four-year-old orphan in Lesotho.Watch him make pretend-fierce faces at that little girl who kept stealing his popcorn in the stands at the Invictus Games. Brilliant.These are not just photo-ops, children carefully selected for charm and whisked away if they misbehave. His charities report it is hard to move Harry on, that he notices any shy or confused child in the background and includes them, that a malnourished or injured infant moves him to lean in with instinctive comfort.            Funny faces: Harry, patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, attends Sitting Volleyball competition at the games in Toronto, Ontario, CanadaBabies and small children move us all to protectiveness, and toddler mischief makes almost everyone laugh. But there are a few good omens too for Harry’s future children as they get older.Who can forget his admission about growing up in a royal world of formality. ‘To be honest,’ Harry said, ‘dinner conversations were the worst bit about being a child and listening to the boring people around me.’This, one feels, will be the kind of father who, after decent politeness, lets his children unobtrusively sneak away from the table.            High five! Prince Harry plays a young child who is going through a programme for malnourishment during a visit to Mokhotlong, LesothoAs for the teenagers, he should have enough fresh memories of his clubbing days both to give them advice, and to see right through any stratagems.It is fashionable to pretend that mothers and fathers are not only equal parents but identical.Certainly men can do traditionally female tasks with nappies and bottles (Harry seemed very adept bottle-feeding that baby rhino recently, even dropping a kiss on its horny face).But there is often something refreshing and breezy about the male approach to childcare.             Prince Harry scoops up six-year-old Alex Burke from Manchester, winner of the Bravest Child Award, who had just asked \u0027where\u0027s your crown?\u0027As the poet and broadcaster Mike Rosen once said, you do all the mum things but you do them in a blokey way. A woman with a young baby is tired, physically battered, exalted and proud, but also probably spends too much time half-crippled with anxiety.Most of us fret about getting everything right and not only being a perfect mother but looking like one: not only must we make the baby contented but avoid criticism from in-laws, neighbours or Mumsnet bullies.Fathers, on the other hand, are more likely to be just plain soppy with pride at having created this perfect creature. There’s no doubt Harry will be proud as Punch. And unlike many new dads, he won’t need much help or advice either.He’ll be right in there, storming through, from nappies to Nintendo and beyond. Lucky baby.  Baby on board! Beaming Meghan and Harry set sail for their first official engagements in Australia including the Opera House and Sydney zoo - hours after revealing their baby joyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex couldn\u0027t hide their delight as they stepped onto a boat to take a tour around Sydney Harbour this morning - hours after revealing their joyous baby news.The beaming couple looked the epitome of cool as they stepped onto the boat, with Prince Harry lovingly holding onto his pregnant wife\u0027s hand as he helped her onto the vessel. They enjoyed a packed day of engagements, which included being introduced to their koala namesakes and a \u0027stud\u0027 of a short-legged echidna, as they admired the \u0027so cute\u0027 wildlife of Taronga Zoo. After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre. Departing, the couple were treated to a ride in a gondola, giving spectacular views over Sydney Harbour and allowing a glimpse of other animal enclosures, including a curious baby elephant.After the Duchess changed into flat shoes, they walked the short journey down a ramp and out of the zoo, catching a ferry - made private for the occasion - to the Sydney Opera House surrounded by armed security.The royal couple were greeted by a sea of well-wishers at the Opera House, where they mingled with the crowd.

When congratulated by the media on their happy news, Harry smiled shyly and said \u0027thanks\u0027. They also accepted good wishes from dignitaries including the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon Gladys Berejiklian MP. \u0027Thank you, that\u0027s very kind,\u0027 said Meghan.

And thank you very much for organising the weather! Let\u0027s hope the rain stays off!\u0027 The royal couple arrived on Monday on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, and touched down at Sydney Airport to be greeted by hundreds of supporters. Meghan, wearing skinny black pants and a black, burgundy trimmed coat, was smiling and clutching folders, while Harry gave a thumbs up to bystanders.The couple is due to spend a week in Australia, the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first ever trip Down Under, before jetting to Fiji on October 23 where they will spend two days.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31.The announcement of the pregnancy confirmed weeks of speculation from royal watchers about why Meghan was not joining Harry on his Sydney Harbour Bridge climb set for Friday.Sydney\u0027s weather is expected to be drizzly and cool on today, with showers forecast for most of the week.This won\u0027t be the first time Harry has had to brave the rain in Sydney. Last year, he made a whirlwind visit to cast his eye over the Invictus Games preparations, where he charmed his fans during torrential rain.The tour coincides with the games, which start in Sydney on Saturday. The sporting event, founded by Harry in 2014, gives sick and injured military personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball.Harry and Meghan will attend the games\u0027 opening and closing ceremonies. In all, they have 76 engagements scheduled over 16 days in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.The royal couple\u0027s visit comes six months after Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, made his 16th official visit to Australia, primarily to open the 21st Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast city in Queensland.  \u0027He couldn\u0027t be happier\u0027: Prince Harry is an \u0027emotional wreck but in a good way\u0027 say insiders after he and Meghan announce they\u0027re expecting the baby \u0027he\u0027s wanted for a long time\u0027 By Rebecca EnglishPrince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an \u0027emotional wreck - but in a good way!\u0027 since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.\u0027It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn\u0027t be happier. He is so protective of her,\u0027 the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace yesterday after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.            Meghan walking out of Sydney Airport on Monday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced a day later They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week,Last night it emerged:Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was among the first to know - likely told in person when she visited London last month.Miss Ragland was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Meghan\u0027s estranged father Thomas Markle is \u0027absolutely delighted\u0027 and told her by letter: \u0027You will make a great mother\u0027. Kensington Palace refused to comment on whether Meghan had told her father directly.The baby will be seventh in line to the throne and likely be titled Earl of Dumbarton or Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor unless the Queen bestows prince or princess on them.Moments after the baby announcement, Sarah Ferguson began tweeting a series of pictures from her daughter Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding day last Friday – leading some to question if she felt upstaged.Meghan, 37, has \u0027just\u0027 had her 12-week scan, the Mail understands. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding.The joyous news sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who in recent years has made no secret of his desire to settle down and start a family.It is only 12 months since the couple stepped out together in public for the first time, when they appeared together at the Invictus Games in Toronto. At the time, Meghan was still living full-time in Canada, although preparing to move to London, and the couple were not even engaged.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, towards the end of July, conceived their first child.In mid-July, Harry and Meghan were on a \u0027mini-moon\u0027 royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry\u0027s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.Yesterday a Kensington Palace spokesman said the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were all \u0027delighted for the couple\u0027.\u0027They were able to share their happy news with the Royal Family in person at Friday\u0027s wedding,\u0027 said an aide, which may have accounted for their low-key appearance at the nuptials.A friend added: \u0027They didn\u0027t make a grand announcement but had conversations with their family and friends and told them their news.\u0027Meghan is said to be in \u0027good health\u0027 and has not had to cancel any public appearances because of her pregnancy, unlike the Duchess of Cambridge who sadly suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, a several form of pregnancy-related sickness.Her pregnancy is likely to be monitored closely, however, as by the age of 35 any woman expecting a baby is technically classed by doctors as a \u0027geriatric mother\u0027.The couple\u0027s tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga will be highly demanding. It includes opening the prince\u0027s inspirational Invictus Games for injured service personnel in Sydney later this week.Harry and Meghan have insisted their trip to the two most remote South Pacific islands will go ahead despite the risk of Zika there, which can cause abnormalities in foetuses. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises pregnant women to avoid \u0027all but essential travel\u0027 there.               Kensington Palace announced via Twitter on Monday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in the springA source told the Mail last night: \u0027It\u0027s early days but everything seem to be progressing well and there won\u0027t be changes to the Duchess\u0027s diary. She has a busy tour ahead of her.\u0027 It is believed one of the first to know about the pregnancy was Meghan\u0027s mother, whom friends suspect she told in person when she came to visit her in London last month.In a statement issued through Kensington Palace - no less - Miss Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Speculation has raged in recent months that the yoga teacher and geriatric therapist would move to London permanently to support her daughter - and now her grandchild too. It emerged she gave up her full-time role as a social worker in May, then last month she was spotted taking baby-care classes in Pasadena, California, with reports in some international media claiming it was because Meghan does not want to hire a nanny.

Only such proposals can determine if a breakthrough through is possible.\u0027            EU Council President Donald Tusk (pictured in Brussels today) said the prospect of No Deal looms large as he demanded new concessions when national leaders gather in Brussels           Following a meeting with EU negotiator Michel Barnier (left today) Mr Tusk (right) said he had no grounds for optimism there would be progress at tomorrow\u0027s crucial summit At the long Cabinet today, the PM pleaded with her senior team to \u0027stand together\u0027 as she braced for a frantic 48 hours battling to get negotiations back on track.But while Mrs May managed to stave off the threat of potentially disastrous resignations, ministers laid down a marker against conceding too much.Ministers including Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom are said to have voiced alarm at the idea of not including a hard end date in the UK\u0027s backstop proposals.According to Downing Street, Mrs May told the session that progress was being made in talks and she could get an outcome that honoured the referendum result and did not risk splitting the UK .\u0027I\u0027m convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand firm we can achieve this,\u0027 she said.   Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, pictured left and right respectively arriving for Cabinet today, are believed to be concerned about concessions in the Brexit negotiationsSajid Javid (left) and Liz Truss were also among the ministers at the Cabinet meeting today          Chancellor Philip Hammond, pictured arriving at No10 today, has been pushing for a softer Brexit approachEurosceptic MPs accused No 10 of manufacturing a \u0027confected row\u0027 with the EU to distract attention from a potential sellout. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said the breakdown in talks was \u0027almost certainly theatre\u0027.  But in better news for Mrs May, Mr Baker also admitted that there was neither time nor support for a leadership challenge.\u0027There really isn\u0027t time for a long leadership contest going to the party and probably a general election,\u0027 he said.\u0027And if people were to look at a spreadsheet of where people stand on Euroscepticism and the Prime Minister there are not Eurosceptic numbers to change Prime Minister.\u0027Since Article 50 was triggered, the UK has not been invited to EU summit sessions where Brexit negotiations are discussed - with all contacts on the issue meant to go through Mr Barnier.But the PM has been invited to set out her position tomorrow evening before the dinner begins. They are not expected to respond, and she will not stay for food.The leaders are due to discuss the state of play on Brexit and the future of the EU the following morning - again without Mrs May. Despite playing a limited role in the proceedings, she is due to stay in Brussels throughout the two-day gathering and a separate Asian summit on Friday. EU foreign ministers delivered a series of shots at the UK as they held a meeting in Brussels today.Asked about the prospects of a no-deal Brexit, Belgium\u0027s Didier Reynders said: \u0027A couple of months ago when I was meeting Jeremy Hunt I said that it\u0027s 5050.\u0027I still believe it\u0027s 5050, and there is a need for some good compromise that should be made. \u0027I understand the British government has its difficulties, but I also believe that the EU is united at 27, and this is in our interest to preserve union first. \u0027What is going to be (the) outcome I don\u0027t know. But, I also believe that even if in this week\u0027s debate we are not going to have any kind of deal, there is still time, there is still possibility to get a deal.\u0027            Mrs May has been frantically ringing round fellow leaders including Emmanuel Macron (pictured) to appeal for a shift in their positionSpeaking in German as he arrived at the General Affairs Council, Mr Roth said: \u0027The situation is very serious. It is no game. \u0027We have taken a short pause for breath. All involved must now look into whether the compromises made have been sufficient. \u0027For us, it is clear, we want a fair deal with the GB, but it must be a deal that preserves the integrity of the single market.\u0027 While the UK was demanding \u0027flexibility\u0027 from Brussels, the EU was limited in its room for manoeuvre because of the need to keep the Irish border open, he said. Mr Roth said that Germany had taken the \u0027painful\u0027 step of beginning preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit because \u0027we are in a situation where we cannot exclude anything\u0027, he said.Mrs Leadsom and Ms Mordaunt said they were \u0027fully behind\u0027 the PM this morning.Meanwhile, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has warned that his party\u0027s 10 MPs - who are propping up Mrs May in power - will effective go on strike if she does not stick to red lines on splitting the UK.\u0027We will have to say — \u0027How can we continue implement your domestic agenda, your budgets and everything else?\u0027\u0027 he told the BBC\u0027s Newsnight.\u0027Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act there are a lot of things that we can not support in terms of the government\u0027s domestic and financial and welfare agenda which does not trigger the possibility of Jeremy Corbyn coming into No. 10.\u0027          In the Commons last night, Boris Johnson pressed the PM on whether the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 would be time-limited           DUP leader Arlene Foster (pictured speaking with Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin and Bishop of Glendalough, Michael Jackson in  Dublin yesterday) has been demanding Mrs May holds to her red lines against anything that would split the UK "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/07/515A627000000578-0-image-a-78_1539669620792.jpg","title":"Beaming Doria Ragland spotted Los Angeles","story":"    Doria Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about his lovely news\u0027 after it was confirmed that her daughter Meghan Markle is pregnant with her first childMeanwhile, daughter Meghan and Prince Harry thrilled thousands of fans outside the Sydney Opera House on Tuesday during their first meeting with the public since the newly announced pregnancy.The couple spent longer than the 20 minutes allocated in their schedule to speak to and shake hands with as many well-wishers as possible.She will make a great mom\u0027: Thomas Markle is \u0027excited\u0027 by...\u0027We\u0027re ready and excited to join the club!\u0027 Pregnant Meghan...Getting some practice in already!

The pup was looked after by presenter John Noakes, until the pooch\u0027s death in 1971. Blue Peter then introduced Shep to its studios, arguably the most beloved of the brood to date. The Border Collie was the long-time companion of Noakes following the death of Patch, and the pair were inseparable.

Seattle native Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates after the pair became friendly in high school, and Allen’s philanthropic zeal went on to mirror that of Gates – with the former pledging to give away half of his wealth and spending $95million on charitable causes last year alone.Allen did, however, also take the time to enjoy the spoils of his fortune himself – as a brief glimpse of his homes, yachts, planes, art collection and fabulous lifestyle make glaringly apparent.The fortune of the 65-year-old – who died Tuesday after a battle with cancer – is estimated to be $20.3billion. He never married or had children his immediate surviving relatives are his sister, Jody, and her three adult children – who joined him on some of his global escapades over the years.They lived near him in suburban Seattle, Washington Allen owned at least nine mansions on wealthy Mercer Island, with his main residence listed as a 10,000-square-foot pile boasting a mammoth indoor pool area complete with a slide. One of the other mansions housed his late mother, who died six years ago at the age of 90, and other relatives lived nearby – and his properties also include a floating helipad off the island.Allen also owned an entire island off the coast of Washington, buying undeveloped and uninhabited Allan Island in 1992 with plans to develop a dream home there – but the absence of existing infrastructure and other problems prompted him to sell the land for $8million in 2013.          Allen, worth an estimated $20.3billion, built up an impressive international property portfolio, including Villa Maryland, pictured, in the French Riviera - where Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have spent time and where Allen hosted other celebrities          Allen stayed close to home, basing himself at this estate in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Mercer Island, where he also owned several other mansions, including one for his late mother          The Microsoft co-founder bought this property in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton - one of the most expensive zip codes in America - in 2013 for $27million it features eight bedrooms, 9.5 bathrooms, a spa, home movie theater, seven fireplaces and a 5-car garage over 22,000 square feetAllen spent a lifetime re-investing in his home city, ensuring that his favorite Seattle movie theater, Cinerama, remained open and modernized. He also bought the Seattle Seahawks football team in addition to the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team one state away in Oregon.His property portfolio, however, extended far beyond the Pacific Northwest. Allen purchased former estate The Enchanted Hill in 1997 in the swanky Los Angeles suburbs for $20million the Spanish Colonial home on 24 acres had been built in the 1920s for screen stars Frances Marion and Fred Thomson. Allen drew ire when he demolished the mansion full of Hollywood history, however, and terraced the land, leaving it otherwise undeveloped. He put it up for sale in July for $150million.He certainly had other housing options in California Allen also previously owned a white-walled contemporary home on a stretch of Malibu known as ‘Billionaire’s Beach.’ He bought the property in 2010 for $25million but sold it to Les Moonves in 2014 for a $3million profit – because he ‘hated the sound of the ocean,’ according to a New York Post source.Aside from that, the billionaire also bought a 12,952 square foot Mediterranean-style mansion in 1997 in Beverly Hills – complete with a funicular from the pool deck to the tennis court.          Allen bought a 12,952 square foot Mediterranean-style mansion in 1997 in Beverly Hills – complete with a funicular from the pool deck to the tennis court  Allen purchased two units at this luxury East 66th Street building in Manhattan he first splashed out $13.5million on an 18-room apartment on the 11th floor, then bought the penthouse in 2011 for $25millionAnd he didn’t leave Northern California out, either Allen purchased a whopping 8-bedroom, 9.5-bathroom home in 2013 in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton – one of the nation’s most expensive zip codes. The 22,000-sq-ft residence also included a spa, a home movie theater, seven fireplaces and a 5-car garage.Allen didn’t limit his property purchases to the West Coast, however he also splashed out on an estate in Hawaii, a $7.5million, 10-acre property known as the Thurston Estate in Kailua-Kona, a region on the west coast of Hawaii’s Big Island. The property includes a $12,000-sq-foot main house, an employee residence, beach house, boat shed and a private harbor.The tech billionaire also invested in property in the West, splashing out on what used to be a sheep ranch in Tetonia, Idaho in 1993. The property operated as a luxury mountain lodge for some time called Teton Ridge Ranch, though it closed for business nearly ten years ago.A bit further afield, Allen also made property investments in New York City. He bought an 18-room 11th floor apartment in 1996 at 4 East 66th Street, a coveted Fifth Avenue address, for $13.5million. On top of that, he spent $25million in 2011 for the penthouse at the same address, a property featuring significant roof terrace space. The two apartments combined, one Manhattan real estate expert said at the time, would provide Allen with ‘a huge duplex penthouse.’           Allen also bought a historic Beverly Hills property called The Enchanted Hill in 1997 it was a Spanish Colonial mansion that he knocked down to replace with terraced, undeveloped land - which he put on the market in July for $150million          The tech billionaire spent a reported $7.5million on this 10-acre property known as Thurston Estate in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii it includes a 12,000-square-foot main house, employee residence, beach house, boat shed and private harbor          Allen, left, poses with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates the pair became friends in high school before starting one of the most influential companies of the 20th centuryAnd those were only his US properties. Allen also boasted a home in one of London’s swankiest areas – Holland Park – where other residents include notable billionaires like Richard Branson. In France, he was the proud owner of historic Villa Maryland, built in 1904 at the behest of a friend of King Edward VII. The sprawling estate in the Cote d’Azur played host to Allen’s celebrity parties and was even the site where Brad Pitt and Angelina stayed in 2006 ahead of the birth of Shiloh the family returned with their entourage of children, nannies and bodyguards two years later.All of those eye-watering mansions, however, are only the tip of the iceberg Allen’s veritable fleet of floating homes are just as impressive. The billionaire bought superyacht Tatoosh in 2001, valued at $160million the vessel carries a helicopter, a sail boat and several other boats. It can sleep 20 guests in 10 cabins, attended to by 35 staff in 16 cabins.Next up was one of world’s most extravagant yachts, Octopus, which Allen spent $200million to build before its official launch in 2003. The 414-foot vessel features a pool, two helicopters, a movie theater, basketball court, recording studio and accommodations for 26 guests in 41 suites. Allen famously hosted Cannes and other parties aboard the ultra-luxurious yacht, and often – as a huge rock-n-roll fan – treated guests to his own musical performances.In addition, it wasn’t unheard of for Allen to lend out Octopus for search and rescue operations or scientific studies. In the same vein, another addition to Allen’s floating empire was RV Petrel, a 250.8-foot research vessel he bought from a subsea engineering and construction company. He had the vessel completely refitted last year, and the RV Petrel has already discovered wrecks of the USS Indianapolis and the USS Lexington.Microsoft employees revolt over plans to bid for $10bn...After 24-year reign atop the Forbes list of 400 richest...Share this articleNot all of Allen’s fanciest possessions, however, were residential he also cultivated an art collection so impressive that he has been listed since 1999 in the Top 200 Collectors by ARTnews, the world’s oldest and most widely circulated art magazine.Allen built ‘a highly regarded collection that was notoriously guarded – for many years, he demanded that his employees keep quiet about his holdings,’ the magazine wrote following his death.‘In recent years, he began loosening the secrecy surrounding his collection, which focused on Old Masters, Impressionists, and modern and contemporary art, and included work by artists such as Renoir, Manet, Gauguin, and Seurat, as well as Mark Rothko, Edward Hopper, Alexander Calder, Ed Ruscha, and David Hockney,’ the magazine continued – adding that, in March, Allen sold a $30million painting by Willem de Kooning.A 2015 exhibition titled Seeing Nature – which drew from his collection – was shown in various locations across the US and ‘presented 39 landscapes, including Jan Brueghel the Younger’s depicting the five senses personified and an 18th-century view of Venice by Canaletto.           Another of Allen\u0027s yachts - Tatoosh - carries a helicopter, a sail boat and several other boats.

Turner, Georgia O’Keeffe, Thomas Cole, and Gerhard Richter,’ ARTNews reported, noting that Allen said at the time: ‘Some of these works are so amazing … so you do feel a real responsibility to keep them safe. You are the custodian. It is a serious responsibility, and I take it as such.’In keeping with that persona of custodian, Allen also showed great interest in vintage planes and amassed a significant collection beginning in the 1990s reported to be worth billions. His collection included fighters and bombers from Germany, Russia, the UK and Japan in addition to the United States, and Allen began showcasing some of the aircraft in 2004 in Everett, Washington at the newly-opened Flying Heritage and Combat Armor Museum.He also spent $349,000 on a Soviet scud surface-to-surface missile and $45,000 on a Cold War-era M55 self-propelled howitzer. Perhaps most famously, Allen shelled out $2.5million for a Panzer IV, a World War II-era German tank – only for the sellers to pocket the money and keep the tank, prompting a drawn-out lawsuit (it’s not immediately clear what happened to the tank in the end).What exactly will become of Allen’s fortune, however – who will get the properties, how much will be given to charity and what, of course, will happen to the superyachts – remains to be seen. He signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, one of 40 people who agreed to give at least half their fortune to philanthropy, and gave away hundreds of millions before his death this week. Now hundreds of millions of people and charities – and, presumably, his relatives – are waiting to see where the rest of that colossal fortune will end up. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/22/515F6D0900000578-0-image-a-51_1539725693263.jpg","title":"Purple folders sales soar 75 cent Officeworks Meghan used hide baby bump","story":"    There\u0027s been a sudden surge in the sale  of purple folders since Meghan Markle used them to hide her baby bump at  Sydney Airport on MondayThe stationery item has been flying off the shelves since.Office supplies store Officeworks has reported a 75 per cent increase in sales overnight and has sold out of the suddenly popular item.\u0027Her unlikely accessory has sent stationery lovers into a frenzy, with the purple folder having almost sold out across Officeworks stores nationwide,\u0027 a spokeswoman said.Australian rockers Thirsty Merc will perform for Prince...Feeling all white!

Prince Harry was wearing a grey-blue shirt and trousers. Also in the line-up was Troy Grant MP, the member for Dubbo and minister for police and emergency services, and his wife Toni.Previous royal visitors to Dubbo have included Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1920, the Queen in 1954 and 1992 and Prince Edward in 2006.   The farming region got barely any rain through the winter and has been blighted by temperatures in excess of 45C leading to the death of thousands of cattle, loss of livelihood and severe food shortages. Some areas have experienced the driest spell since records began in 1900. Prince Harry and Meghan  visited the Royal Flying Doctor Service after their arrival to learn more about the life-saving role the aviation service provides for people living in remote areas.   There, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a hero medic who pulled three survivors from a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.

Inspired by Prince Harry, Mr Wilson will be taking part in the Invictus Games in the sailing event.Now manager of the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Broken Hill, about 1500 km from Sydney, Mr Wilson spent 14 years in the military - first as a gunner, then as a medic - before setting up a medical evacuation service for aid workers in Afghanistan.He was at NATO HQ in Kabul in October 2015 when a helicopter crashed near where he was standing.\u0027It missed me by 15-20 feet,\u0027 Mr Wilson, who met the couple at a RFDS event in Dubbo, said. \u0027It was an intense experience.\u0027I was the first on the scene. I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire - there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.           Dubbo crowds await the arrival of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at a picnic in Victoria Park          The hundreds of people had waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the royal couple in the regional city \u0027I had had a chance to live my life. I didn\u0027t want other people to take the risk that I felt I should take.\u0027Medically discharged from the army because of a spinal injury, and traumatised by the helicopter crash, Mr Wilson found himself at a loss after leaving Afghanistan. Then he watched the Invictus Games in Toronto, and volunteered for the Sydney games. \u0027I have seen how much it has impacted not just on me but other team members and their families,\u0027 Mr Wilson said.At the RFDS event, which saw a new aircraft being delivered as the service marked its 90th anniversary, the Duke and Duchess also met patients including Keiley Storer, three, who has suffered from a larynx condition which blocks her airway.She gave the Duchess a posy. It turned out to be a two-way transaction.Her mother Melissa, 34, said: \u0027She said, Would you like one too? and gave her the white one. Then she saw Keiley looking and said, Would you like the big pink one?\u0027But Keiley got distressed that she pulled apart the posy.\u0027Her father Christopher said: \u0027She shed some tears shortly after. It was, Oh no, my posy.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are showing their support for farming families affected by one of Australia\u0027s worst ever droughts while in Dubbo          The family explained how they have adapted to the drought, before inviting Harry and Meghan for morning tea at the homestead with their family          The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887The couple also met nurses and other staff and volunteers from the service. David Charlton, RFDS aviation general manager, said told the expecting couple that they deliver babies mid-flight several times each year.\u0027Our staff thought at was quite interesting, given the couple\u0027s current condition. The couple found it most amusing, and interesting. We all wanted to ask if it was a boy or a girl, but everyone behaved themselves.\u0027Before leaving, the couple cut a cake marking the anniversary. Harry gave it a good sniff, and helped himself to a bit of icing. \u0027He licked the icing from the knife,\u0027 Mr Charlton said. \u0027Which in Australian parlance is going straight to the pool room.\u0027The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887. Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm, including to the paddock where the Duke and Duchess had an opportunity to help feed the cattle.   Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm full time alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm          The Duchess of Sussex whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her on a visit to a farm to highlight the plight of farmers hit by drought          Pregnant Meghan, 37, cooked the delicious treat in the kitchen at Admiralty House on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in SydneyBritish man Marc Sutton snowboarding and biking in his spare timeMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboAdorable moment Harry and Meghan receive hug from young childMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Harry and Meghan drive to the Airport as they set off for DubboHarry and Meghan touch down in the country town of DubboKent Police raid properties and arrest 200 in drugs crackdownPrince Harry helps speaker swat flies off her faceMeghan Markle greets fans outside the Sydney Opera HouseBercow calls for independent investigation into bullying allegationsFirst trailer for Peter Jackson\u0027s They Shall Not Grow OldFollowing the rule that a guest should never arrive empty handed, the Duchess had whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her.Meghan, 37, cooked up the treat - an Australian favourite - in the kitchen at Admiralty House, the home of the Governor-General of Australia, on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in Sydney.She took the cake, packed with chocolate chips and a touch of ginger, with her to Mountain View Farm.An aide said: \u0027She loves baking and just decided to take something along with her on the spur of the moment.The duchess also took along the perfect accompaniment- a tin of Fortnum and Mason \u0027Royal Blend\u0027 tea.Before the Duchess had even left, only a quarter of the loaf remained.Benita Woodley, 20, the daughter of Scott and Elaine declared it delicious: \u0027It was such a nice and thoughtful thing for her to do.

The royal couple boarded the Royal Australian Air Force plane at Sydney Airport on Wednesday morning           The visit to Dubbo is part of the couple\u0027s 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, their first overseas tour since they were married in late May           Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were back at Sydney Airport just two days after they touched down in Australia for the visit to Dubbo           Prince Harry, pictured in the Queensland outback in 2003, has very fond memories of rural AustraliaAfter graduating from Eton, Prince Harry, then 19, spent his gap year in 2003 working as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station, a sprawling 16,000 hectare cattle property 150 kilomtres northwest of Roma in outback Central Queensland.The station was owned at the time by Annie and Noel Hill, who were friends of his late mother Princess Diana.Mr Hill was the son of millionaire polo star Sinclair Hill, who coached Harry\u0027s father Prince Charles.Prince Harry spent three months working at the station and earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax.Working from 7.30am until 6pm, his duties include mustering cattle and mending fences, The Daily Telegraph reported at the time.He also found time to jet around Australia to a few Rugby World Cup games to cheer on his beloved England, who memorably won the tournament following a dramatic extra-time win against Australia in the final.          Prince Harry looked very much the seasoned stockman during his three month stint as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station in 2003          It\u0027s understood Prince Harry earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax\u0027I have had a great time working out here, meeting people and learning a bit about how to be a jackaroo,\u0027 Prince Harry said in a statement at the time.\u0027And of course the rugby was absolutely fantastic. It\u0027s a great country.\u0027One major downside to the working holiday was the lack of privacy and being under frequent public scrutiny with media crews permanently camped outside the station.There were reports the prince contemplated cutting short his three-month Australian adventure as a result.\u0027Learning about the farm and the jackaroo trade, that\u0027s what he wants to do, not dodge the cameras,\u0027 Prince Charles\u0027 press secretary Colleen Harris said at the time.Lib McEwan, wife of Injune Hotel licensee John McEwan added: \u0027I think our locals are starting to get a bit defensive because they\u0027re feeling sorry for him. The media is spoiling the whole deal that was supposed to happen.\u0027          Prince Harry developed a strong bond with Guardsman during his time on the station          Prince Harry was just 19 when he worked on an Australian outback cattle station for Annie and Noel Hill, friends of his late mother Princess Diana"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/07/515A863100000578-6280587-A_glowing_Meghan_Markle_has_been_pictured_fawning_over_an_adorab-a-84_1539671975653.jpg","title":"What Prince Harry said met adorable baby reception Sydney Meghan Markle","story":"    Australian singer Missy Higgins has described Meghan Markle as a \u0027sweetheart\u0027 and added Prince Harry \u0027was gorgeous too, a real charmer\u0027 after the couple fawned over her baby daughter Luna at a reception in Sydney on Tuesday           A glowing Meghan admired Ms Higgins\u0027 adorable baby, telling the songtress she and Prince Harry were \u0027excited to join the club\u0027\u0027What an honour to meet the beautiful Duchess today,\u0027 Ms Higgins posted on Instagram on Tuesday alongside two photos of her cradling her daughter and meeting Meghan.  \u0027She was such a sweetheart.

This would be a constitutional affront.It is not just Northern Irish unionists who oppose it. So does Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland: they know that any weakening of the ties that bind Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK would be exploited by separatists peddling Scottish independence. We cannot leave the European Union in a way that threatens the much more ancient and precious Union of these four great nations.During the course of the summer, it became clear to me that the so-called Irish backstop promised national humiliation and would never get through Parliament.But you can’t beat a plan with no plan. So I set myself the challenge of devising a workable Plan B, one that would deliver our exit from the European Union next March in accordance with the people’s vote in the 2016 referendum, protect people’s jobs and incomes by securing the benefits of continuing tariff-free access to the Single Market, and – crucially – command the support of a majority of MPs.Very simply, it involves the UK leaving the EU on March 29, 2019, and, for an interim phase only, moving to a position like Norway’s in what is called the European Economic Area (EEA). That’s the Common Market that integrates the economies of countries in the EU with those of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.We would be inside the Single Market (as most businesses want) but outside the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy, and outside the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.              Leader of the Scottish conservatives Ruth Davidson is opposed to anything which could leave Northern Ireland in a different trading arrangement than the rest of the UK as this would encourage the SNP to seek a second independence referendumWe would need to join the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) – of which the UK was a member before we joined the EU, and which negotiates free trade agreements for Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein – as either a full member or an associate member. And we would need to agree continuity in our customs arrangements for the interim period.From this halfway house, we would negotiate a long-term economic relationship based on a Canada-style Free Trade Agreement, as has been proposed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and others.Since the beginning of September, I have been meeting with MPs of all persuasions – passionate Brexiteers, committed Remainers and unbending Unionists – and I have been struck by the response. Nobody loves the ‘Norway then Canada’ approach – but, crucially, everyone can find some things they like about it, and most of them can see how they might be able to swallow those bits they like less, if they are offered other assurances and guarantees.For Remainers, having continuity on the Single Market and on customs for this interim period appeals because it secures the position of vital industries like car manufacturers and aerospace companies, whose businesses are based on the fluid import and export of parts between different European countries.For Leavers, dumping the permanent subjugation to EU legislation promised by the Prime Minister’s Chequers plan, and instead committing to a Canada-style Free Trade Agreement as the format for our long-term economic relationship, offers the prospect of a real Brexit, in which the UK eventually takes back control of our money, our borders and our laws.For Unionists, my plan offers an absolute guarantee that all parts of the UK will move through the different stages together, that all will benefit from continuity on the Single Market and customs in the Norway phase, and that all will leave the Single Market and the customs union together when we are ready. I believe this plan – which won the very significant endorsement of former foreign secretary William Hague on Monday – has the potential to unite the Conservative Party, and indeed the country.But I don’t want to pretend that achieving a consensus will be easy, or that the Brexiteer lion is going to lay down with the Remainer lamb, and start singing Kumbaya in sweet harmony. Committed Leavers are worried that life alongside Norway in EEAEFTA will prove too cosy and comfortable – that Parliament will lose the will to move out into the bracing winds outside the Single Market and the customs union.We will only win their support for this plan if the Government is wholly committed to negotiating a looser economic relationship based on a Canada-style free trade agreement, and implementing it before the 2022 election so that Labour doesn’t have a chance to stop it.We may need to pass legislation enshrining that commitment – and to get the country ready to leave the EEA without a free trade agreement if the EU refuses to play ball.Having scuppered one Brexit deal by insisting on an eternal lock on Northern Ireland’s future, it would be an extraordinary act of self-harm for the EU to scupper this deal – one that delivers all of their objectives – by insisting on the same.We should also be straight with the British people. In the halfway house alongside Norway, we would still be subject to a version of freedom of movement – although we would have some wriggle room to restrict it to people with job offers, and even to impose a temporary brake if numbers get out of control.That is one of the main reasons why it would not be acceptable for the halfway house to become the UK’s permanent home. People voted to end freedom of movement, and we must not let them down.On her return from this evening’s EU summit, the Prime Minister has an opportunity to make a clean break and a fresh start. She should acknowledge that despite her best endeavours she has not been able to reach an acceptable agreement with the EU on her Chequers plan, and that she will now come to Parliament with a proposal for a staged withdrawal via the EEA and EFTA. Most MPs would be relieved. Business leaders would applaud. European leaders would grumble about the wasted time and effort, but they would welcome our embrace of an off-the-shelf arrangement with which they are already familiar.I believe it is Theresa May’s destiny to be the Prime Minister who delivers Brexit in a way that preserves the UK’s prosperity, constitutional integrity and position in the world. With a Norway-then-Canada plan, she can do it.Read Nick Boles’ Brexit plan at www.betterbrexit.org.uk  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/22/5152F40D00000578-0-image-m-14_1539726957418.jpg","title":"One six children miss chosen secondary school","story":"    While last year, there were 582,761 applicants, this year there are likely to be more than 607,000This first caused problems for primary schools, with many having to create extra classrooms and super-size classes.Now the issue is transferring to secondaries as the extra children age.

Other past badly-hit areas have included the Home Counties, due to London overspill, and big cities such as Birmingham. The last five years have seen a 12 per cent rise in applicants to secondary schools and the intake in 2019 will be the largest in decades.Mrs Coatman added: ‘The demographic bulge, the result of the highest birth rates since the 1970s, has been anticipated for many years but the slow trickle of new schools and expansions has failed to provide enough places which match parents’ expectations.’For autumn 2018 entry, one in six children missed out on their chosen secondary place, with the proportion rising for the fifth year in a row.

Alice Mann, a London-based photographic artist, was awarded the 2018 Taylor Wessing  prize 2018 at the National Portrait Gallery, London, on Tuesday, for four pictures of the majorettes.Many of the drummies, as they are affectionately known, come from some of the most disadvantaged communities in Mann’s native country. It is the first time in the competition’s history that a series of images has won rather than an inidual photograph the rules were changed to permit multiple pictures in 2015.Mann said: “These four portraits are some of my favourite images, especially the one of Riley and Wakiesha because they are so charismatic. For these girls, involvement in drummies becomes a vehicle for them to excel, and the distinctive uniforms serve as a visual marker of perceived success and represents emancipation from their surroundings.“Continuing my consideration into notions of femininity and empowerment in modern society, it was my intent to create images that reflect the pride and confidence the girls achieve through identifying as drummies.”Her portraits were chosen from a shortlist of four entries, which had been whittled down from from 4,462 submissions by 1,973 photographers from 70 countries.The judges praised Mann’s series for “its evocation of a sustained and intriguing narrative. Each sitter is precisely framed within a carefully considered composition, and the girls confidently meet the camera’s gaze. Their pristine and vibrant outfits jar with the rundown surroundings, lending a surreal and enigmatic atmosphere to the portraits.”Enda Bowe, was awarded the £3,000 second prize for his photograph of a woman holding her baby on a housing estate in Clapton, east London, part of a series called Clapton Blossom.The judges described Bowe’s portrait as tender, tracing “the emotional connection between a new parent and her baby, evoking traditional compositions of a mother and child. Further scrutiny reveals details, including Cybil’s piercings, tattoos and adorned nails, which with the urban setting, give a contemporary update to this classical theme.” Bowe, an Irish photographer based in London, said he was trying to find “the colour and beauty in the urban, the light in the grey”.Third prize went jointly to Max Barstow for his double portrait of a pair of shoppers taken in London, and Canadian-born Joey Lawrence, now based in New York, for his photograph of a child from a village in the jungle of Sierra Leone’s Eastern Province. They are awarded £2,000 each.Since the competition began in 1993, it has provided many of the winners with exposure they had not previously experienced and a launchpad to illustrious careers.All four images will be part of the annual Taylor Wessing  exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, which begins on Thursday and runs until 27 January 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ad210da38e5f86762614415ad4ea366475e40d/768_3875_5148_3089/master/5148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8255d43fb748b40268d554fc724e609","title":"british museum albukhary foundation gallery of the islamic world review","story":"British Museum, LondonTwo new rooms present an alternative history of the world, beginning with works with a geometric sophistication and abstract calm that western art could not achieve for another 10 centuriesThe best way to get to the British Museum’s new gallery of Islamic art is via the Sutton Hoo gallery. That way, you first take a trip through Anglo-Saxon England, past Celtic gold, Viking jewels and treasures from the burial of a seventh-century king. These artefacts, lurking in shadow, all date from a time that is often called the Dark Ages. Then you step out of that gallery and into a world of light.Streaming in through patterned screens and coloured glass, the light spills over lustreware, the glazed ceramics invented by medieval Islam that have an iridescent quality. Such luminous clarity seems to shine right through Islamic art: what you see here resembles the Enlightenment in 18th-century Europe – an age of reason that, in this case, started in the eighth century.I’m not trying to knock the west for the sake of it. It’s just that Islamic art soared to heights of mathematical sophistication and abstract calm at a time when the very appeal of European creations tended to lie in their savagery. The Sutton Hoo helmet is a glaring totem of primal power. By contrast, the first thing you see in the new Islamic gallery is a fresco portrait and a well-preserved carved wooden panelling from Samarra in Iraq. Dating from the ninth and 10th centuries respectively, they bear witness to a rich urban civilisation.It is not easy to convey in a museum the artistic glory of the lands converted and conquered by Islam from the 7th century onwards, from Egypt to Spain. Many of the most beautiful achievements of Islamic art are site-specific ensembles of architecture and decoration: the Ben Youssef Madrasa in Marrakech, the Alhambra in Granada. How can a museum convey the play of light and geometry that makes these so intoxicating with single tiles and fragments of pottery?The British Museum does it with state-of-the-art display cases perfectly spaced so that wherever you look there is something new to catch your eye, a subtle mix of natural and artificial light and, most of all, a clear thread of argument. Right from the start, we see how Islam forged its own aesthetic from a mixture of classical influences, religious imperatives and a scientific sensibility.In western Europe, the Roman empire was gone. In the east, however, it survived as Byzantium. A Byzantine marble capital (the decorated top of a column) carved with regularly spaced clusters of grapes and intertwining foliage shows how the playful, almost abstract transformation of nature into art in Rome and Byzantium gave Muslim artisans a model for an art of symmetry and pattern.The cliche that Islam forbids all representation is demolished: there are human as well as animal portraits throughout this gallery. But we do see how the abstract was preferred in mosques. And objects such as an astrolabe made in 1240 show how it was the Arab world that preserved and extended ancient Greek mathematics during the middle ages.All this comes together in the “arabesque” vision that flows through this gallery like the music of the spheres. From fine filigree metalwork to sumptuous Ottoman clothes, the same intricate system seems to join one object to another in an invisible network of cosmic connections. What western art historians would label the arabesque is an ordering of nature grounded in geometry. Images from the observed world – hares, trees, fruit – get absorbed into a precise yet complex and opulent structure that suggests the underlying laws of the universe. It is spiritual but it is also scientific.Tiles from 13th-century Iran show the full glory of this style. They are designed to tessellate intricately in a pattern of stars and crosses. Even removed from that overall geometrical splendour, each tile is a seductively intricate interlacing of plant stems and constellations of buds, with hares and leopards posing in the abstract forest. Tiles from 16th-century Istanbul show the same inner harmony, this time with bolder colours and a more extrovert fluidity of flowers.This gallery is a kind of miracle. It sees beyond inidual objects to grasp and communicate the principles and intellectual power that give Islamic art its infectious harmony and abundance. Yet it does that without oversimplifying. Within the continuity there are, it seems, inexhaustible details. The story of Islam is told chronologically down the centre of the L-shaped space with side cabinets that explore everything from the archaeology of lost cities to the distinctive footwear of the Ottoman empire.

It is “incredibly original”, according to the Booker’s chair of judges, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah.“None of us has ever read anything like this before,” said Appiah, announcing the win at a dinner at London’s Guildhall. “Anna Burns’s utterly distinctive voice challenges conventional thinking and form in surprising and immersive prose. It is a story of brutality, sexual encroachment and resistance threaded with mordant humour.”As the award was announced, Burns was lost for words. At the press conference afterwards, the 56-year-old author said her job as a novelist was “to show up and be present and attend. It’s a waiting process”. She “just had to wait for my characters to tell me their stories”.Asked about how she had filled the long gap since her 2002 Orange prize listing for No Bones, she said she had done commercial events and moved houses. What will she do with the money? “I’ll clear my debts and live on what’s left.”The win makes Burns the first Northern Irish winner – previous Irish winners, including John Banville, Anne Enright and Roddy Doyle, all come from the republic. It also makes her the first female winner since 2012, when Eleanor Catton took the award with The Luminaries. Burns beat writers including American literary heavyweight Richard Powers, Daisy Johnson, at 27 the youngest author ever to be shortlisted for the award, and Canadian Esi Edugyan. According to Appiah, the judges, picking from a shortlist that delved into some dark themes, were “unanimous” in their choice of winner – and not influenced by concerns that picking a third American winner in a row could cause controversy.Burns, who was born in Belfast and now lives in East Sussex, drew on her own experiences growing up in what she called “a place that was rife with violence, distrust and paranoia”. As the milkman presses his advances on the reluctant middle sister, rumours begin that she is having an affair with him. “But I had not been having an affair with the milkman. I did not like the milkman and had been frightened and confused by his pursuing and attempting an affair with me,” Burns’s narrator tells us.“I don’t know whose milkman he was. He wasn’t our milkman. I don’t think he was anybody’s. He didn’t take milk orders. There was no milk about him. He didn’t ever deliver milk.”Milkman also spoke to the concerns of today, he said. “I think this novel will help people think about #MeToo ... It is to be commended for giving us a deep and subtle and morally and intellectually challenging picture of what #MeToo is about.”Appiah added that Burns’s narrator, a girl who reads as she walks (“This would be a 19th-century book because I did not like the 20th century”), has an “extraordinary” voice.“She is sustained by her own good sense, by her humour and by her reading. She is a literary person in a rather unliterary society,” said Appiah, who was joined on the judging panel by the crime writer Val McDermid, the critic Leo Robson, the feminist writer Jacqueline Rose, and the artist and graphic novelist Leanne Shapton.Burns, who has previously been shortlisted for the Orange prize, revealed in the  last week that Milkman has its origins in “a few hundred words that were superfluous in a novel I was currently writing”. She tried to craft a short story from them, and they turned into Milkman.“The book didn’t work with names. It lost power and atmosphere and turned into a lesser – or perhaps just a different – book. In the early days I tried out names a few times, but the book wouldn’t stand for it. The narrative would become heavy and lifeless and refuse to move on until I took them out again. Sometimes the book threw them out itself,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0226b19691897b773191ccd85800887dbca94501/0_547_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c977675929b1aff8f8c10e3f27294582","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces had several admirers last week. Peter Law-Jones wrote:Coming to the end of A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, a surreal journey through a febrile mind and New Orleans. The sense of a truly absurd world is both unsettling and very funny. An excellent read.And the Thepuffpastryhangman said:I’m enjoying A Confederacy of Dunces for a second time. An utter joy. The descriptions of Ignatius’s ‘hobby’ make me snork every time. Second only to the magnificent Lucky Jim for laughs.On the subject of rereading, bobthekelpie has had an interesting experience with “an old favourite that I periodically reread”, The Swish of the Curtain by Pamela Brown:What I did not realise until I started reading my daughter’s copy, is that the version I loved as a child, that I have faithfully reread all these years, was heavily abridged. OMG MIND BLOWN.So I’m now reading an old, but wonderfully new and better version of one of my favourite books.Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel is “an amazing, amusing, informative book” according to Dogbertd, who has to be quoted in full:I’m really glad I stumped up for the hardback because the pictures are (naturally) an integral and important part of the book, and you’ll want time to examine them closely. Hamel is an engaging and amusing guide to 12 of the most precious books written in Europe in the period before Gutenberg made print accessible to all.Hamel uses the same method throughout. First, a description of where the book is housed – along with sometimes caustic comments on his experience of getting his hands on the books – he hates those white gloves you’re sometimes forced to wear, but he loves the librarian in St Petersburg who gives him chocolates to eat as he’s perusing a 15th-century manuscript. Then he describes the book itself, pointing out the most interesting features: it’s like having the the best tour guide in the world at your side – in one book on the Apocalypse he notes that the Antichrist has had his face scratched out by an outraged reader – as has the Whore of Babylon (serves her right, he says). He then expounds on the history of the book and the sometimes murky routes it has taken to its current resting place.Along the way you’ll learn what a Psalter or Book of Hours is, why many manuscripts have pictures of cats playing viols (and it’s not because of the connection to catgut) and why the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury both bowed down before de Hamel.It’s a superb book if you love books and history, the Middle Ages, literature and art.Here’s a brave admission from NorthernSceptic:No doubt. Meanwhile, Grumpywoman56 recommends A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman by Margaret Drabble:It’s a collection of short stories and I’m really enjoying it. She eloquently expresses the hidden thoughts (even to themselves) of women. They were written in the 70s but it could apply to today’s society. It’s spurred me on to read more of her work.I needed something light-hearted and his equal parts interesting and amusing style is perfect. The only trouble is, I’ve read nearly 250 pages since Sunday night so I’ll need to find something else by the end of the week …How about Émile Zola’s The Beast Within? It has grabbed beingsentient:Tolstoy’s War and Peace has won over FrogC:I am reading War and Peace for the first time, at the age of 61. Only about 200 pages to go now. It is extraordinary, and there is no other novel like it. All the same, the essays on history, where Tolstoy forgets his characters for a few chapters and just rants about the errors of historians, are very strange, and one is inclined to think a novelist can’t do that. The only reason he gets away with it is that there is so much else going on at the same time.And tericheri adds of the same epic novel:That’s what I call a good read. The rest are mere trifles.All of them?!Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

We mean a lot to people. Our postmen and women mean a lot to people.“I really am embarrassed that we got this engagement with shareholders so wrong and I want to assure the committee that we won’t do that again.”In the same session on executive pay, the transnational consumer goods company Unilever said it had failed to listen to shareholder concerns by pressing ahead with the ill-fated plan to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam.The firm had learned lessons less than two weeks after it was forced to scrap the plans, MPs were told.Peter Newhouse, director and executive vice-president for reward at Unilever, was asked whether the company had a poor track record of listening to shareholders – after more than a third voted against the firm’s pay policy in May.“I understand what you’re saying,” he said. “It sounds like a sensible way of looking at it.”Royal Mail has a pay ratio of 78 to one, when comparing Greene’s £1.8m pay package as chief executive with the £23,000 average starting pay of a postal worker.Reeves said the ratio at Unilever was 315 to one, more than twice the FTSE 100 average of 146 to one. Last year the chief executive, Paul Polman, received a pay package worth €11.7m (£10.3m).After the select committee hearing, Reeves said: “Companies need to pay much more attention to their shareholders, workers and the public when they set chief executive pay.“As a committee we will continue to take a close eye to the issue of corporate pay and examine what impact government action, such as pay-ratio reporting, is likely to have on delivering fair pay.”Both firms admitted they had yet to respond to shareholder concerns over pay raised at their annual meetings, but said they would meet investors and publish a statement of action in the coming months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735a53f32aa8e3506b96263d32b1f3598c2adfd6/107_107_3682_2209/master/3682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29059ceed0b30f582a86a1000c38502e","title":"false promises brexit john major","story":"Those who persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer will never be forgivenOur value – as an ally of America – will decline. No “ifs”, no “buts”: we will be less relevant. No one should be bedazzled by folksy talk of our “special relationship”: it is becoming less “special” year by year.For centuries, our state schemed and plotted to prevent all Europe uniting against us. Now, we have chosen to turn our back on all Europe. A long line of former statesmen will be turning in their graves.We are told our future aim is to be “Global Britain”: that is certainly the right policy, but it is hardly new. It has been the reality for 300 years.What is new is that much of the world will now perceive Britain to be a middle-sized, middle-ranking nation that is no longer super-charged by its alliances. Suddenly, the world will be a little chillier.If the art of negotiation is to obtain what you seek, then the intention must be to give a little to (hopefully) gain a lot more.I cannot know how the government has conducted negotiations in private with the European Union: very possibly they have met the tenets I have set out. But, even if they have (and not all the signs are good), belligerent noises-off – on a daily basis – have built up ill will, and made the prime minister’s task even more difficult.We know the post-Brexit world will be very different from now. It cannot be otherwise, because no form of Brexit will remotely match up to the promises made by the leave campaign in the referendum: they were vote-gathering fantasies, not serious politics.I have no constituency vote clouding my view of Brexit. I have no ambition driving my support for it. I have no party whips demanding loyalty before conscience. I have made no false promises about Brexit that I must pretend can still be honoured, even though – in my heart – I know they cannot. I am free to say absolutely and precisely what I believe about Brexit. And it is this:I understand the motives of those who voted to leave the European Union: it can – as I well know – be very frustrating. Nonetheless, after weighing its frustrations and opportunities, there is no doubt in my own mind that our decision is a colossal misjudgment that will diminish both the UK and the EU. It will damage our national and personal wealth, and may seriously hamper our future security. It may even, over time, break up our United Kingdom. It will most definitely limit the prospects of our young.And – once this becomes clear – I believe those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for. They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer. That will never be forgotten – nor forgiven.Our domestic focus is on the impact leaving Europe will have on the UK. That is quite natural, but, to the world at large, the bigger question is how the EU itself will be affected. The answer is – badly. Without the UK the balance of the EU changes. The free market majority may be at risk: protectionists will be encouraged and, perhaps, empowered.The UK will no longer be a buffer between the Franco-German steamroller and smaller nations. Germany will be more isolated, and friction may grow. “So what?” committed Brexiteers say. “We won’t be members: it’s Europe’s problem.” But that ignores reality. How can it not be our problem, too?Whether we are “in” or “out” the EU is in our neighbourhood it is our predominant economic partner and our wellbeing is inexorably linked to their own wellbeing. In the hot heat of debate it should not be forgotten that we ignore the EU, disdain it, or stand aside from it, at our own risk. None of the mainstream political parties is in a healthy condition. Both the Conservatives and Labour face pressure from fringe opinion within their own membership.My fear is that the extremes of right and left will widen isions and refuse to compromise, whereas more moderate opinion will often seek common ground. The risk of intransigence – “my way or no way” – is that the mainstream parties will be dragged further right and further left.Our nation should not tolerate the unreasoning antipathy of the extremes – to the EU, to foreigners or to minority groups. Such antipathy is repellent, and diminishes us as a nation. Softer, more reasonable voices should not be drowned out by the raucous din of the loudest.I freely confess to a taste for compromise. Politics is real life. It isn’t warfare. It isn’t a popularity contest. It’s about people. It’s about four nations who deserve more than an ideological tug of war.Respect and civility would do much to help lift politics out of the dog days in which it is now living. More compromise – less confrontation.• John Major is a former British prime minister.

For a few days last October, it even looked as though the revelations might inflict the same level of damage to politics as was caused by the expenses scandal a decade ago.Yet the storm passed. Although the Speaker, John Bercow, and the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, palpably do not get on personally, they promised root-and-branch change. By this summer, a new, independent complaints system, crafted by Ms Leadsom, was up and running, while Dame Laura Cox was commissioned to write a wide-ranging report on the issue. Amid the turmoil over Brexit, many at Westminster may have assumed the job had been done.Dame Laura’s report, which was published on Monday, explodes any such complacency. Her 155-page findings are a sweeping indictment of the culture and behaviour of a modern parliamentary democracy that struggles in multiple ways to bring itself into the 21st century. The report establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that harassment and bullying by some parliamentary officials and MPs continue in the present day and are attributable, to quote her penultimate paragraph, “to systemic or institutional failings and to a collective ethos in the House that has, over the years, enabled the underlying culture to develop and to persist”.Dame Laura does not mince her words about how this has been allowed to occur. She found “a culture, cascading from the top down, of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence”. It is a culture of entitlement to power that has proved adept at the art of covering up such abuses in the past and, Dame Laura suspects, will do so again. “I find it difficult to envisage how the necessary changes can be successfully delivered, and the confidence of the staff restored, under the current senior House administration,” she concludes.The buck stops with Mr Bercow. He is the man at the top. In his nine years in the Speaker’s chair, he has been a reformer. He has been accessible to the public, spoken up for parliament in the country, and, above all, has stood up for backbenchers against the executive. One of his best innovations has been his readiness to allow the asking of “urgent questions” – on topical issues of the day – at the start of the day’s Commons business. It is ironic that another such question, which he allowed on Tuesday, was the catalyst for a fresh wave of attacks on him in the wake of Dame Laura’s report, which led to well-sourced suggestions that he will step down in 2019.Mr Bercow has many enemies, especially in the Conservative party of which he was once a rising star. Labour, by contrast, supports him, as do the opposition parties generally, not least because they suspect he will not be the government’s poodle when the Commons gets its decisive say on Brexit. This is an immensely important consideration. But there is more at stake here than party politics, even on the most important question facing Britain.Mr Bercow is not a modern Nero. But his time is nearly up, and parliament will need fresh leaders once the Brexit votes are over. He is right to stay on for the big Brexit showdowns, when he may prove vital to saving the country from a disaster. But his speakership is on probation now, and it is right that he stands down at the end of this parliamentary session next summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5f8d78fd4826bae375b9042c64f7d1237d8692d/0_69_1342_805/master/1342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fdfff46fc31ef5e1923b615b99b528","title":"china new diplomacy broken porcelain sweden","story":"Beijing’s message to Sweden and beyond – criticise us, and we’ll topple your agenda – won’t win it any hearts and mindsTwo days after Sweden’s election in September, a bizarre statement appeared in English on the website of the Chinese embassy in Stockholm. A “small handful of Swedish forces, media and iniduals”, it said, had made “unwarranted claims” of Chinese interference in the Swedish vote. These were “groundless accusations”, and a “malicious attack and smear against China”. The strangest thing of all: no one in Sweden  had the slightest inkling what the statement referred to.As an expert on China’s official discourse who also studies its influence in Europe, I too struggled to make sense of this storm in a teapot – until a few days later, when a new tempest whirled into view. This time, Sweden noticed. The source of the fresh controversy was an online video that purported to show the “brutal treatment” of three Chinese tourists at a hotel in Stockholm. As I read the angry comments from China’s foreign ministry, it suddenly all made perfect sense. The expressions of outrage were part of a concerted diplomatic strategy of hyperbole and distraction.In the video, the tourists – identified as Mr Zeng and his two elderly parents – are carried from the hotel by police officers, and deposited on the pavement outside as the son screams in English: “This is killing! This is killing!” The mother sits on the pavement and wails: “Save me!” According to a local newspaper, Aftonbladet, the tourists had arrived at the hotel the night before their scheduled booking and asked to remain in the lobby through the night. They disregarded repeated requests to leave, remaining instead on the lobby sofas. One eyewitness said the police remained calm as the Chinese family grew agitated. The son, this source said, acted particularly oddly, “throwing himself flat on the ground”. Quoted by local media, a Swedish prosecutor later said: “We made the assessment that no crime on the part of the police had been committed.”The Chinese embassy, in a statement on 15 September, insisted that the tourists had been “brutally abused by the Swedish police”, which had “severely endangered the life and violated the basic human rights of Chinese citizens”.Many Chinese people who viewed the video clips on domestic social media platforms were furious about what they saw as mistreatment. But others saw something different: a familiar pattern of using over-dramatisation as a means of recourse for real or imagined injustice. Called “porcelain bumping”, or pengci, this pattern became a focus of attention as the hubbub over the Stockholm incident continued in China. Pengci refers to the practice of manufacturing drama to obtain a desired outcome. According to one explanation, the term was coined to describe a technique used by fraudsters who would wait with delicate porcelain vessels outside busy markets and demand payment when these shattered, ostensibly due to the carelessness of others. Now, pengci often refers to the act of throwing oneself into oncoming traffic in order to claim compensation – a practice so common in China that related compilations of clips online are now nearly as ubiquitous as cat videos.Still, the Chinese embassy in Sweden continued to depict the incident as a grave case of human rights abuse. The foreign ministry’s position was parroted by state-run media. One article shared by a social media account of the People’s Daily alleged that talk of “porcelain bumping”, and other attempts to minimise the Stockholm incident, had been cooked up overseas by Falun Gong, a spiritual movement that the Chinese government has labelled an enemy.At this point official Chinese outrage had moved on to a skit aired on 21 September on a satirical show by the Swedish national broadcaster, SVT, that made light of the incident. A statement from the Chinese embassy said the skit had “breached the basic moral bottom line of humankind”. Moreover, it had “seriously infringed on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity” by projecting a map behind the host that did not show Taiwan and Tibet as an integral part of China.This came at an already tense time in the bilateral relationship. The Dalai Lama had visited Sweden just days before the video of the tourists appeared. Another sore point was China’s continued imprisonment of a Hong Kong-based bookseller, Gui Minhai, who is a Swedish citizen. Oscar Almén, a researcher at Uppsala University, told Radio Sweden: “The Chinese embassy is now actively trying to deliver a message to the Swedish media and the public.”That message is a solemn promise to government and society in Europe and beyond: wherever you seek to criticise our policies or forestall our ambitions, we will topple your agenda. We will shatter the porcelain of diplomatic composure and fan the anger of our population with debased facts until every issue you raise is about just one issue – China’s national dignity.The Chinese embassy in London demanded an apology. And while it made a fuss about the reporter’s rights, it also pointed out, in a statement, that “any plot or action conspiring to ide China is contrary to the current of history”. Discussion of Hong Kong’s future, in other words, was to be avoided.The pattern is clear. When it comes to foreign criticism of the Chinese government, or to the strategic issues it cares about, we’re all tiptoeing through a china shop now. The danger is that such histrionics could make European governments, universities, scholars and journalists, to remain silent, retreat from issues likely to prompt an outburst. Europe must send a message that it welcomes free, open and calm discussion of all issues, and that it will not suspend its values or the rights of its citizens to appease China’s official bouts of anger. If we refuse to indulge such tactics, China’s government will eventually come to understand what many of its citizens already know – that you don’t win hearts or minds through intimidation.• David Bandurski is the Berlin-based co-director of the University of Hong Kong’s China Media project"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8a6e011f75d744965ea79bc7b71916643e27db8/0_241_4864_2919/master/4864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3716fe98e09ebea3c8ce25ff74ba69a","title":"kosovo serbia land swap ethnic cleansing","story":"The Balkans are boiling again. This time it’s because speculation is rife that Kosovo and Serbia may finally end their dispute and normalise their relations. Kosovo’s president, Hashim Thaçi, and his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vučić, are said to be close to an agreement that would help stabilise the Balkans and open the doors for both countries to join the European Union. Negotiations are happening under the mediation of the EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. Ten years after Kosovo declared its independence, the last chapter of the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia would be closed.It sounds like a fairytale. Two leaders who were on opposing sides in the 1998-1999 war that left thousands of Kosovar civilians killed, tens of thousands of homes burned and destroyed, more than a million people expelled and displaced – and which ended only after Nato intervened – would have suddenly conquered their hatreds and enmities for the sake of a better future for their people. A breakthrough at last?On the contrary, it could turn into a nightmare. The deal under consideration is sometimes called a “border correction”, or an “exchange of territories”. Neither Thaçi nor Vučić have given much detail, but it seems that the agreement would see part of Kosovo’s northern territory, with a majority Serb population, joining Serbia meanwhile part of southern Serbia, a region commonly known as Preshevo Valley, whose population is majority Albanian, would join Kosovo.This land swap would result in fewer Serbs living in Kosovo and fewer Albanians in Serbia. Both countries would become more “ethnically pure”. Many people would have to leave their family homes and birthplaces. In short, there would be an exchange of populations, not just territories.Charles Kupchan, former adviser to Barack Obama and now a professor at Georgetown University, has described the tentative plan as “peaceful ethnic cleansing”. Supportive of the land-swap idea, he believes “pragmatism needs to trump principle”. I beg to differ.Creating ethnically homogenous territories and states (in short, getting rid of minorities) is hardly a new idea. In Kosovo, throughout history, it’s happened many times. And it has always left deep wounds that simply won’t heal. Almost every Kosovar has family stories to vouch for this. Here are mine.The first goes back to the dying years of Ottoman rule in the Balkans. In 1877-8, my mother’s family was among tens of thousands of Albanians expelled from their homes in the village of Berjan i Poshtëm (Donje Brijanje in Serbian), located in today’s southern Serbia. Even now, during family gatherings, elder cousins recall the stories their grandfathers told – of houses, fields and graves they had to leave behind. Their expulsion was ethnic cleansing, made irreversible by the 1878 Congress of Berlin.Another family story is from my late paternal grandfather. As a child, I would watch his tearful eyes and hear his deep voice trembling while he recalled a night in 1927 when he, his father and his elder brother had to leave their house and pastry shop in the town of Pravishte – now Eleftheroupoli, in eastern Greece. It happened as a consequence of a Greco-Turkish Lausanne agreement on population exchange. This was not their homeland, but it was all they had to provide for the family back in Kosovo. They were given only a few minutes to pack, there was no violence, everything was peaceful, as my grandfather would describe, years later. But it was ethnic cleansing, nonetheless.Just a few minutes to leave was also what many Kosovar Albanians were given by Serb military and security forces, in March 1999, when Slobodan Milošević’s campaign of ethnic cleansing was in full swing. It was repressive, violent, bloody and criminal. Many were killed, most were expelled. Over a million people were turned into refugees, including almost all my mother’s family, descendants of those expelled from southern Serbia, 120 years earlier – as were many relatives on my father’s side, descendants of those who’d had to abandon the pastry shop in eastern Greece. I ended up as a refugee myself, in Macedonia. We were all victims of ethnic cleansing, and it took Nato’s intervention to reverse that.I don’t think those supporting the Kosovo-Serbia land-swap idea aren’t aware of the risks. They just ignore the obvious. Ethnic cleansing is a crime, peaceful or not. Apart from being morally unacceptable and ultimately anti-European, the plan would also cause huge, long-term political and security instability across the entire region. If Kosovo and Serbia are allowed to swap territories and people, how could that be denied elsewhere? Many communities in the region dislike the state they live in: Serbs and Croats in Bosnia, Muslims in Serbia, Albanians in Macedonia, or even Hungarians in Slovakia and Turks in Cyprus.That’s why many oppose the “solution” that is seemingly under consideration. In Kosovo, the land swap has been rejected by a majority of parliamentary parties as well as by the governing coalition. Kosovo’s status and borders derive from its independence in 2008, based on a plan proposed by the former Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari. That solution was found by the international court of justice to be in accordance with the law.There is next to no support for Thaçi’s land swap among Kosovo Albanians. The deal wouldn’t be ratified by Kosovo parliament even if he were to sign it. And a majority of Kosovo Serbs are also against it, as it would mean many would end up “on the wrong side of the border”.The border deal is also unacceptable for many western countries – notably Germany and the UK. Angela Merkel has made clear she rejects any border changes in the Balkans. “This has to be said again and again, because again and again there are attempts to perhaps talk about borders, and we can’t do that,” she warned in August.So the real question for the EU is this: why would Brussels even entertain the notion of supporting a plan that so deeply contradicts European values, that is rejected by European capitals, and unwanted by most people on the ground? Federica Mogherini can and should provide some answers.• Agron Bajrami is editor in chief of Koha Ditore, Kosovo’s leading newspaper"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/055507ff251f948189946f506b0645558d146ced/175_278_5825_3495/master/5825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=809d81d58147d73e95345819c10ef7af","title":"open europe report no deal brexit study","story":"The sudden flurry of activity in Brussels over the weekend served as a salutary reminder that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” when it comes to Brexit. Indeed, that seems to be true within the UK cabinet itself, since it seems that, one way or another, events in Westminster pulled the rug out from under the talks in Brussels. A painfully complex but potentially face-saving compromise to the vexed question of the status of Northern Ireland after Brexit appears to be farther away than ever.And so, despite the fact that all of those who ostensibly control the process – the UK government and parliament, the European commission, the EU27 member states and the European parliament – actually want a deal, there remains a very real prospect of the UK leaving the EU without one on 29 March 2019.So, if no deal has only a relatively modest economic impact, what’s the bad news? It’s that the report – despite its title – is not about no deal at all. Indeed, Open Europe’s director conceded as much. What the report models – and, to be fair, the text itself is clear enough, even if the title is misleading at best – is the long-term impact of a move to a position where the UK trades with the EU on WTO terms. This is an outcome consistent with both a deal and no deal. It is all too easy to envisage a situation in which the UK signs a withdrawal deal with the EU but then, for whatever reason (incompatible negotiating positions, problems ratifying a deal in the EU, problems ratifying it in the UK), fails to agree a trade deal. This would result in a “trading on WTO terms” outcome.But the no deal that is in prospect now is what happens if the UK and the EU would fail to agree, or to ratify, a withdrawal agreement between now and March 2019. Of course, one implication of this would be that the UK and EU would have to trade on WTO terms. But that is just the destination, not the journey. As we explained in our recent report Cost of No Deal Revisited, the immediate impact here relates not to the longer-term trading arrangements the UK develops, but, rather, to the short-term uncertainties, the political implications and the timescale under which this would happen.First, no deal would create massive uncertainty owing to the disappearance of many of the rules underpinning the UK’s economic and regulatory structure. This is why people worry about whether aircraft will be able to take off. The rules governing flights between EU countries are EU rules, and they will cease to apply the moment we drop out with no deal.Less obviously but no less importantly, no deal implies chronic uncertainty about contracts. Again, it is EU law that provides the framework within which a UK trader can trade with Germany and expect the EU to protect her in the event that her German counterpart defaults on the deal. Following no deal, legal rulings in the UK would carry no force in other member states.Add to this the politics. A no-deal outcome would be ugly and would doubtless involve much mutual recrimination from both sides. This will have implications way beyond economics (security collaboration might conceivably be one crucial victim), but when it comes to trade, the angry and hostile mood would surely militate against the kinds of mitigations that might limit the impact of no deal. Why would the EU try to limit the pain when its priority will remain satisfactory resolution of the withdrawal issues – the Brexit bill, citizens’ rights and the Northern Irish border?And, finally, there is timing. In the event a withdrawal agreement is signed, the UK would have an additional 21 months to prepare for life under new trading arrangements, whatever they may be. In the event of a no deal, this would begin in March 2019 – long, long before either the UK or EU member states put in place the physical and other infrastructure necessary to make trade under WTO rules work effectively.That being said, we do think more care should have been taken in specifying what this report is about, particularly in a context where no deal – in our sense – seems a pretty plausible outcome of this process. Should Britain leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement, then the immediate economics – and politics – of this would be far, far more disruptive and damaging than the Open Europe report implies.• Anand Menon is director of the UK in a Changing Europe initiative and Jonathan Portes is its senior fellow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49c5608c0a76bfa17b1d98b5b327e1369029a1c/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0819d70c10b7ca56a66cb51fa9da987","title":"race for space greed nasa","story":"Nasa’s greatest feats were a triumph for mankind. History will be less kind to today’s space pioneersThe promised journey is from Earth to the edge of space, rather than London Euston to Crewe, but the story of Richard Branson’s company Virgin Galactic still has echoes of a bad passenger experience on his trains. For the best part of a decade, his potential customers have been waiting for an experience that was meant to arrive in 2011, with only one certainty to hang on to: the tickets are eye-wateringly expensive. The price for Virgin rocket travel now apparently hovers at around £250,000, and reports suggest that among those patiently waiting to climb aboard are Katy Perry, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga.Now, though, there may finally be a breakthrough. Even if he said something very similar in 2017, Branson claims that the rocket-powered craft known as VSS Unity is “weeks, not months” away from reaching the all-important altitude of 80.4km (264,000ft) above Earth – which means that the first paying passengers should be experiencing weightlessness and marvelling at the curvature of the Earth “not too long after”. As and when that happens, the feat will be framed in terms of a win for him over the two other tycoons who are spending an inordinate amount of money on private space flight: the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, with Blue Origin, and that increasingly accident-prone visionary Elon Musk, the brains behind the electric car firm Tesla, and Space Exploration Technologies Corp, better known as SpaceX.While the idea of state-led space travel may yet be decisively revived by China, the new space race in the west is something almost surreally different: a competition between rich, often knowingly “flamboyant” entrepreneurs, whose motivations are open to speculation. For sure, some of their innovations are genuinely useful: witness SpaceX’s reusable rockets. But too often, there is a telling gap between these people’s professed ambitions, and the anticlimactic stunts that currently earn them the biggest headlines – something perfectly symbolised by Musk’s talk of colonies on Mars, and that stupefyingly pointless spectacle of a mannequin in one of his sports cars, launched into space back in February, and then stranded in orbit. Such spectacles, perhaps, are a distraction from rising questions about how exactly private space flight should be regulated, both because of its dangers (in 2014, a pilot was killed while testing one of Virgin Galactic’s space-planes), and the rising sense that some elements of the new space race are built on a very earthly kind of greed. The latter is evidenced by the companies that have plans for asteroid mining, prospecting on the moon – and, by way of a punchline provided by a Japanese firm called ispace Inc, projecting adverts on to the lunar surface. Tellingly, the roots of a lot of what is happening lie in the thinking of small-state libertarians who hoovered up the work of the US author Ayn Rand, and saw Nasa’s retreat from space exploration as decisive proof of the uselessness of government. A good example is Peter Diamandis, who has worked with Branson on space flight and founded the X Prize Foundation. His first big act was the awarding of $10m to the people who in 2004 took a privately built craft called SpaceShipOne just beyond the Earth’s atmosphere. In 1994, he drafted a charter for early work on private space flight. “Throughout all of history,” he wrote, “the greatest accomplishments of the human race have been instigated and acted upon by the inidual or the small group – never have the masses brought about innovation.”In this vision, it seemed, space travel was to be the preserve of a self-conscious elite largely untroubled by governments and less interested in exploring new frontiers on our behalf than in leaving the rest of us behind. And so, perhaps, it is proving. Blue Origin will reportedly soon be offering brief trips to the edge of space for up to $300,000 a throw. As soon as 2023, SpaceX will transport the Japanese retail tycoon Yusaku Maezawa around the moon, a privilege for which he has paid an undisclosed sum. The US company Axiom Space is working on a private space station it claims will be launched in 2022. The people in charge promise “a microgravity laboratory where educators, scientists and researchers conduct life-improving research”, but the most remarkable part of the plan is a proposal to take “high-worth” iniduals into space for eight days, at a cost of $55m each.You can only wonder: in place of Armstrong’s first small step, what will that give the rest of us to marvel at? The revelation that rich people experience weightlessness too?Even if they are not up there with the colossal amounts spent by Nasa in the 1960s and 70s, the sums of money going into the new space race are still mind-boggling. Virgin Galactic came into being thanks to an initial $100m of funding from Branson’s Virgin Group, and subsequently received around four times that amount from a sovereign wealth fund based in Abu Dhabi. Bezos is funding Blue Origin to the tune of at least $1bn a year SpaceX is reckoned to have an annual turnover of nearly $2bn.Meanwhile, an emergency is happening back on boring old planet Earth: the growing crisis of climate change, dramatically highlighted by the recent IPCC report that warned we have no more than 12 years to avoid an ecological catastrophe. Many of the new space entrepreneurs, including Branson and Bezos, are funding some research in this field Musk’s electric cars are an undoubtedly worthwhile contribution. But if the same people have a shared vision of innumerable private rockets leaving Earth whenever there is enough business, it may be worth bearing in mind the volume of carbon emissions that will entail, and the much-reported view of a California-based rocket engineer called Martin Ross, who says: “We now understand that the climate and ozone impacts of rocket exhaust are completely intertwined.” Besides, an even bigger question surely cries out for an answer: if the Earth is burning, why is so much money being frittered away on sending cars, pop stars and bond traders into orbit?We may now be faced with a kind of space exploration that doesn’t hold out any of the romantic promise of yesteryear, but simply reflects the kind of terrestrial injustices to which the new spacemen perhaps give far too little thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1da896c4a4a85091deb502fd84b01aa21bfc72/0_253_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd239580e6481217764eb1bf4254626","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of yellow","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘yellow’The closing date is Wednesday 17 October September at 10am.

They find she had been hiding painkillers around the house, and getting them from a circle of friends who shared medication to avoid costs.The original Roseanne ran from 1988 to 1997 and was praised for its realistic portrayal of working-class life.The revival in March, in which Barr was a supporter of Donald Trump, was ABC’s biggest hit, drawing an average 18 million viewers per episode.The opioid theme at the centre of The Conners is topical. Addiction to opioids – mostly prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl – has reached epidemic proportions in the US. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in more than 49,000 deaths last year.ABC cancelled Roseanne in May after Barr sparked a furore with a tweet that compared black former Obama administration Valerie Jarrett to an ape. Barr apologised and said the tweet was political, not racist, in its nature. But she agreed to step away from the show she created and have no financial or creative involvement in The Conners.Executive producer Bruce Rasmussen said the makers of The Conners had thought carefully about how to write out Roseanne’s character. “You don’t want to be flip about how you do this,” Rasmussen told Variety in an interview last week. “A lot of people cared about these characters and it’s separate from whatever feelings they had about the person and her political views and the things she said.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d60b6829fd896d0be182d94dc701a072ec135c2/0_438_3647_2189/master/3647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14efb03d6ce0a89a7e28712ad0cc77b5","title":"adventures on the coast of wales by the people who know it best","story":"Wales isn’t just sheep, dragons and castles – it’s also a world-class activity destination. Ask the people who live there …Cleopatra Browne, founder of Celtic Quest Coasteering I’ve visited many coastal destinations across the globe, but nothing compares to Wales’s wet and wild coastline. The rock formations, sandy beaches, sheer cliff faces, Atlantic swell and abundance of marine life are all world-class.When the sea is rough, the coastline is truly wild, with waves crashing along the cliffs or rolling into the sandy beaches. When calm, the stunning glassy ocean allows us to explore caves and hidden coves. Then there are the people – Pembrokeshire folk are extremely welcoming. I love learning about the history of our little stretch of paradise from locals.My outdoor career began 20 years ago at a multi-activity centre on the Pembrokeshire coast, where I gained experience in kayaking, surfing, climbing and ing. Coasteering was by far my favourite – it is often described as extreme rock pooling. You explore a stretch of coastline at sea level, traversing the rocky shore, adventure swimming, cliff jumping, exploring caves and more. I saw an opportunity to offer the activity to everybody – not just outdoor enthusiasts. We tailor the experience to the expectations and abilities of each inidual. Being able to swim helps but is not essential as the safety equipment can do the floating for you.What’s great about coasteering is that participants can get up close and personal with the coastline without the need for boats, boards or ropes. All that is required is a wetsuit, a buoyancy aid and a helmet – as well a sense of adventure and a guide with a good splash of local knowledge. Then you’re set for hours of fun.Wales has a reputation for wet weather, but seeing as you can’t get much wetter than when jumping from cliffs into the Celtic Sea, that doesn’t put a stop to our activities. That said, the Welsh coastline is stunning in the sunshine. Looking down from the Wales Coast Path over the crystal-clear waters, visitors often remark that their visit has exceeded expectations.All of our adventures finish in the Blue Lagoon, an old slate quarry flooded by the sea. Its waters are 25 metres deep and the cliffs climb 30 metres above. If you park at Abereiddi beach, the lagoon is a short walk along the coast path – it’s the location of the World Series Cliff Diving competition, and truly is a stunning spot.Cwm-yr-Eglwys between Fishguard and Newport is another favourite, also off the beaten track. A secluded cove with clear blue water, it’s perfect for snorkelling, kayaking and standup paddle boarding.Wales is a truly world-class adventure destination, which offers just about every activity you can imagine.Catherine Williams, operations manager at Snowdonia-ActiveGrowing up near the Peak District, I developed a love of exploring the outdoors. But because the area is landlocked, with the nearest coast more than two hours away, I chose to do my degree in north Wales to satisfy my love of the mountains and desire to be close to the sea.My academic background is in psychology, and my master’s degree investigated the mutually beneficial relationship between people and nature. This led me to my role at Snowdonia-Active, where we fully believe in and promote the benefits of spending time being active outdoors.The Welsh coast is a mecca for outdoor activities, and home to some of the most beautiful coastline in the world. I’ve lived here for 12 years and I’m still finding new coastal spots that amaze and inspire me. It’s super accessible and on the doorstep to the mountains – I can’t think of many places in the world where you can spend the morning in the mountains and the afternoon by the coast.I have three favourite spots. My must-do activity is coasteering on Anglesey – an activity that involves scrambling, climbing, jumping and swimming your way around the coast. I’ve recently had a little girl, so I’m seeking some softer adventures at the moment too, such as exploring the hidden coves at Borth y Gest near Porthmadog and dipping our toes in the sea. I also love Rhoscolyn Beach for sea kayaking, followed by a glass of wine at the White Eagle – a favourite with William and Kate when they lived in Anglesey.With a place as special as Snowdonia, it is vital to promote quiet enjoyment through recreation, as we do at Snowdonia-Active. Wales is leading the way in this area, with wildlife and conservation organisations working and the outdoor sector collaborating on education, wildlife monitoring and practical conservation projects. Whether you want quiet coves, busy beaches, clifftop walks, climbing, wildlife spotting or simply to hang out in a beer garden with an incredible sea view, the Welsh coast has it.Phil Scott, founder of RibRide I’ve lived in north Wales since 1991, apart from an eight-year stint in the Caribbean. I’m passionate about watersports: sailing and Ribs (rigid-hulled inflatable boats), windsurfing and kite-surfing. I also love running and mountain biking.North Wales is simply the best location in the UK to enjoy these sports at a high level in a stunning environment. I feel so lucky to live here and be bringing up my family to enjoy the unique culture and opportunities.After returning to north Wales from the Virgin Islands where I was skippered a luxury yacht, my business partner and I invested in a Rib to start RibRide, the first adventure boat tour company in north Wales. We now have 11 boats, a storage yard, a training academy, six full-time staff and an award-winning track record – we are listed as the top outdoor activity provider in Wales on TripAdvisor.The region has one of the largest tidal ranges in the UK, and one of the longest tidal estuaries, the Menai Strait, which causes one of the fastest tidal currents. People think the Menai Strait is a dangerous stretch of water, but it’s actually one of the most sheltered, user-friendly locations there is as long as you have the right knowledge and experience.An ideal day for me would be a visit to the Marram Grass restaurant in Newborough with a short walk to the Roman stepping stones and the home of Maurice Wilks, the original designer of the Land Rover – followed by a two-mile walk to Newborough Beach over one of the largest sand dune systems in the UK.With its assorted beaches, cliffs, islands and coastal paths, north Wales is one of the most peaceful, soulful, relaxing and energising places you will ever find.Adventure holidays across Wales are made for all ages and abilities.

From rugged clifftop peaks to sprawling, serene beaches puffins to porpoises ­– natural beauty of incredible variety and scale is everywhere. Wales is the only country in the world that boasts a walking trail ning its entire coastline. The really dedicated can tackle the whole 870 miles. You can even run it – the current record is 23 days.For those more inclined towards a gentle hike or a relaxed amble, taking in glorious sunsets from castles or viaducts, here are eight of the best coastal walks.Aberaeron to New Quay (6.5 miles)New Quay claims to be the inspiration for Llareggub, the fictional seaside village at the centre of Dylan Thomas’s masterpiece Under Milk Wood – and it is worth a visit alone so that you can make your own mind up. This easy trek between two of the loveliest fishing towns in Wales takes you through forests, waterfalls and fern, finishing at glorious Traeth Gwyn beach in New Quay. Make sure to plan your timing with the tide in mind so you get the full experience, and have time for a swim in fine weather. The Hotel Penwig boasts a seafront location and is ideal for an overnight stay or just a drink to toast a fine walk.St Govan’s chapel, Pembrokeshire, to Stackpole Quay (5.5 miles)Expect medium intensity here, mainly because of the steep steps that take you down to the mystical St Govan’s chapel, the real draw of this lovely walk. St Govan’s origins are debated, including the suggestion that he was Gawain, the legendary knight. Another story has him as an Irish Christian missionary who took shelter from pirates in these rocks and then created his monastic chapel in thanks to God for his survival. The remarkable stone structure has been as weathered by the sea as the rocks around it, but it remains in good shape. Look out for the bird life – chocolate brown guillemots and black razorbills come in the summer to breed on the cliffs. For a different wildlife experience, the walk also takes in Bosherston Lily Ponds, where house martins and swallows skim over the lily-covered fresh water. Also nearby is the beautiful Barafundle Bay – with its clear waters and expanse of golden sands, it is the closest Britain gets to the Caribbean.This short and slightly steep walk is well worth it. One of the best views in Wales awaits you, only a small, well-signposted distance from the town of Barmouth, which was a favourite of the poet William Wordsworth. At the summit, you’ll have a view of the dramatic upland landscape of Cadair Idris, as well as the Mawddach Estuary, but be sure to make time for the spectacular wooden Barmouth Bridge. It is just over 150 years old and, at 699 metres long, it is Britain’s longest wooden railway bridge. You can walk or cycle over the bridge for free.Mumbles to Three Cliffs Bay (12.5 miles)This is a long walk made easy thanks to the well-maintained path. Three Cliffs Bay is a perfect example of the particular charms of the Welsh coastline – the wildness, the feeling of being outside of time, the awe-inspiring peace. This walk is the perfect summer outing, and the bay provides a picturesque picnic location that would be hard to beat. The Gower Coast Path has many highlights, and this scenic walk is one of the most breathtaking.Holyhead to Trearddur Bay (12 miles)You are spoiled for idyllic walks in Anglesey and this stretch offers a perfect mix of cliff-hiking and open coastal views. You begin in the impressive Holyhead Breakwater country park, built on the site of an old quarry. Regular exhibitions and displays offer information about the local wildlife – which include falcons and peregrines – to any accompanying little ones, and a friendly cafe with local suppliers will set you up for the day. The entire Anglesey coastline is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and this walk has some of the most breathtaking views. Visit South Stack lighthouse to watch the breeding seabirds on the cliffs and experience the full drama of wind and sea. You can also get guided tours of the lighthouse. Once you’ve arrived at your destination, a stay at the seafront Trearddur Bay hotel is highly recommended.The Glamorgan Heritage Coast is so-called because it’s been recognised as an area of notable natural beauty or scientific significance, and walking it you can see exactly why. It’s as much a treat for amateur geologists as it is for keen walkers. You’ll pass by Dunraven Castle, and although it hasn’t survived intact, it makes for a striking and almost magical scene. If you decide to do the full walk, make sure you’re aware of the tides as they can take you by surprise. The Blue Anchor is the perfect traditional countryside pub for a pie and a pint when you’re done.Conwy to Llandudno (18 miles)This ambitious walk is perfect for experienced long-distance hikers, but the route is also easy to ide into smaller sections for those who only have an afternoon. It will take you up the Conwy River estuary and around the Great Orme, allowing for spectacular views of the north Wales coastline. As well as being a scenic delight, this is a walk for the historically minded – Llandudno has managed to keep its briny Victorian charms intact, and Conwy boasts an imposing medieval castle built in the 13th century.A very good walk based around some of Dylan Thomas’s old haunts, taking you via the River Taf and a Norman castle. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is a must-see, bound to inspire those of a poetic bent – and the deck is the perfect place to sit with a coffee to take in the estuary. Laugharne Castle is a well-preserved and strikingly beautiful site, with a glorious view from the top of the tower. On your return, why not enjoy a beer in famous literary watering hole Brown’s hotel, where Thomas entertained his fellow writers and students.

Forty years later, she toured the area with her teenage daughter. Is it still as enchanting? Back in the 1970s, a good 20 years before the advent of low-cost airlines made short European breaks as cheap as a trip to the local seaside, my family made regular jaunts to an Italian village that was only two hours, door to door, from our home in Manchester. The place was the height of exotica: it had a campanile and a pantheon, palm trees and fountains, a cluster of brightly painted houses on the clifftop overlooking the lagoon, and the locals spoke another language. Only the weather punctured the illusion that we were on the Italian Riviera or the Amalfi coast because we were, in fact, in Wales.But in my memory the sun often shone in Portmeirion: and when I returned last month with my teenage daughter, to show her where I spent so many holidays, there was sunshine again (some of the time). My daughter, it’s fair to say, was sceptical about our expedition. Holidays for her tend to begin with a short train ride from our house in south London to Gatwick this one started with a five-hour drive through a cloudy Wales. But when we reached Snowdonia the clouds lifted, the day brightened, and suddenly Catriona was being wowed by vistas of green and blue mountains, fields full of sheep and cows, and tantalising glimpses of lakes. There were occasional animals on the roads, but hardly any other cars.We breezed into Portmeirion, crossing the threshold I remember so well into the magical kingdom founded by architect Clough Williams-Ellis in the 1920s. Williams-Ellis was an eccentric who first started to dream of setting up the place as a child of five or six, before going searching for the perfect island on which to site it in the early 1920s. But no island seemed quite right and then he discovered a rocky promontory outside Porthmadog, and set to work. First came Hotel Portmeirion, which opened in 1926 across the years that followed came the gatehouse and the battery, the prior’s lodging and the campanile, the roundhouse, and pastel-coloured cottages with names such as Dolphin and Angel. As the place grew, its fame expanded, and it soon became the “It” location for A-listers such as George Bernard Shaw, Daphne du Maurier and HG Wells. Noel Coward came here to write Blithe Spirit part of the Inn of Sixth Happiness, with Ingrid Bergman, was filmed in Portmeirion’s pagodas and it was the Village in the 1960s cult series The Prisoner, alongside Patrick McGoohan, who starred as “Number Six”. But topping all this, for Williams-Ellis himself, was the visit of Frank Lloyd Wright, who declared its creator a true architect.The village today is exactly as I remember it, with the delicious addition of an Italian gelateria Catriona thought that it was like a more upmarket and colourful Center Parcs, set by the waves rather than among trees. We ate focaccia laced with Anglesey salt and feasted on the tenderest assiette of Welsh lamb with shallots and turnips in the opulent dining room of the main hotel, beside a bank of windows overlooking the estuary, before wandering up the hill to our room in Castell Deudraeth, neglected during my childhood but now reinvented as a cooler and more laid-back version of its big sister by the shore.Day trippers are welcome at Portmeirion, but part of the enchantment if you’re staying is to see the village empty of visitors, either at first light or when it’s floodlit. By day we headed off to explore north Wales beyond Portmeirion: and first stop was the station at Porthmadog, meeting point of two narrow-gauge heritage railways, the Ffestiniog and the Welsh Highland lines. We opted for the latter, and as we chugged through the countryside wrapped in billowing steam I was transported back 40 years. “This is exactly how it was when I was young,” I told Catriona and to my surprise (because this was not the sunniest moment of our trip) she said she was loving it too. By this time she had discovered that Snowdonia has the fastest zip wire in the world, and was begging me to book our next holiday here as we couldn’t fit it in on this visit. First, though, there was Beddgelert to explore, eight miles and 40 minutes down the line from Porthmadog: it’s a picture postcard village named after the grave of a dog called Gelert, hound of one Prince Llewelyn who, the story goes, killed it after mistakenly blaming it for mauling his son. In fact, the dog had fought off a wolf trying to do just that when the stricken Llewelyn realised his mistake he rushed back to his faithful friend, who gamely licked his hand with its final breath. A brilliant story, agreed Catriona with tears in her eyes, even if it’s more likely to be folklore than truth.Our final stop was Criccieth, where we wandered along the beach at dusk, enjoying the views of the 13th-century castle that sits on a hillside high above it. Lloyd George, though born in Manchester, is the local hero, as he spent his childhood from 1864 to 1880 in a house that’s now a museum: you can see the future prime minister’s school desk, and the workshop where his uncle made shoes.Criccieth has the feel of a fairly traditional Welsh seaside town, but its dining scene is pukka 21st century since the reopening of a sweeping art-deco-style glass-fronted building designed by Williams-Ellis and used in the 1950s for tea dances. Today, we’re eating at Dylan’s, one of a trio of seaside restaurants specialising in local food and a neighbourly conscience: there’s a sign advertising the next beach clean-up at the gate, recycled plastic bottles have been turned into a stunning fish mosaic above the entrance, and the menu features mussels from the Menai Strait and lobster from Morfa Nefyn across the peninsula. And while the food might be local, the vibe is unashamedly big city hustle and bustle – a perfect combination, as far as my teenage daughter was concerned.For inspiration to plan your break in Wales check out visitwales"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

She explains why she feels so inspiredOn the morning of 16 August 1819, an estimated 60,000 men, women and children gathered at St Peter’s Fields in Manchester to call for parliamentary reform and suffrage for workers. The army tried violently to disperse the crowd, killing 18 people and wounding more than 650. It remains the bloodiest political clash in British history. John Edward Taylor’s fearless reporting of the violence brought it to national attention and later led him to create the .When I heard Mike Leigh was making a film about Peterloo, I decided to drop him a line. I sent him a postcard saying something along the lines of: “Dear Mike, I believe you’re doing a film on Peterloo. I would love to be part of it, but if not, it’s wonderful news that you’re bringing the story to a wider audience.”That was about a year before the film started shooting. He wrote back and said: “Of course you can be in it, I don’t quite know what I’m doing yet. I’ll call you when I do.”Mike has always been an actors’ director, known for responding to correspondence from actors. I first met him when I left drama school. I did my final-year showcase at Rada, where you get to perform two pieces of your choosing in front of various agents and casting directors. One was a duologue from April De Angelis’s Playhouse Creatures with the glorious Sally Hawkins. We wrote to the casting director Nina Gold – one of the best in the business, who casts Mike’s films – and as a result we were invited to meet him. Sally, of course, went off to work with him immediately and they have collaborated many times over the years now she is a multiple Oscar-nominated star. I had bits and pieces, such as a day’s work on All Or Nothing, but he is very loyal to his actors. Even if you just worked for him a little, he won’t forget you.There are no leads in Peterloo – it is truly an ensemble piece, with more than 100 actors. My character, Nellie, appears sporadically, but is very much part of a family unit. I was very fortunate to work with a group of fabulous actors. Between us we not only created a backstory for our own characters, but also for the whole family and the whole street they lived on.Nellie is the matriarch of a poor, hard-working family from Manchester (Angel Meadow, to be precise) and a mother of five. People who have seen the film have been surprised, as they regarded her as not political. I beg to differ. Nellie may not be a reformer or an active part of the movement, but she is very clued up on the workings of the world. She cares passionately about the future, not just for her children and her children’s children, but also for society as a whole. Nellie fears the struggle has been hijacked by a lot of men spouting a lot of hot air. She is a doer – actions not words – but there is the rub ... partaking in direct action at this time could get you the death penalty.A lot of the audience were people who knew very little about Peterloo or the poem. They wanted to talk, to debate. It felt like a really important time for me. I had begun to feel disillusioned with politics and I was trying desperately to keep my faith that another way could be possible. At the same time, it felt as if hope had started to grow again. It felt as if there was a door opening for people who wanted a better, fairer way.The Labour party’s “for the many, not the few” goes back to the last line of The Masque of Anarchy: “Ye are many – they are few.” I joined Labour so I could vote for Jeremy Corbyn. I had always voted Labour, but I never had any intention of joining the party until it became viable that Corbyn might become the leader. We have just had the party conference and, all right, I am biased, but as far as I am concerned, this year has been extremely encouraging and positive. It felt like a proper party conference. Socialism is on the cards again – it is no longer ridiculed as something archaic and naive.The Peterloo massacre was not something I was taught in school. I had a typical comprehensive history education: kings and queens, nothing about my people, nothing about working-class history. It was only through my grandfather that I gained any knowledge of Peterloo. He gave me a potted history when I was about 12 or 13.My grandfather had a life-changing influence on me. He never had any ambitions to be a politician – he worked on the assembly line at Leyland Motors – but his life was politics. He was a self-educated man and he had a thirst for knowledge. He was a member of the Communist party. I joined when I was 18. My grandad wanted me to wait until I was old enough to make my own decisions. He warned me: “Getting involved in politics is not a hobby, Maxine. It has to be your whole life if you commit now, it will take over.” He was right.I am not intellectual by any stretch of the imagination. For me, getting involved was about fairness. I wanted an equal world. I wanted peace, jobs for all, nuclear disarmament. I wanted feminism, I wanted to abolish racism. I wanted healthy, fair, progressive politics. I might have been naive at 18, but if so I am still naive now. My goals have not changed – I still want that now.I left the Communist party at 21, when I went to London to drama school, for no other reason than that I could not fulfil my commitments to it. But I am still a socialist. I decided that if I was going to be political, it would be through my work. I was always sceptical about the effect that television, theatre and cinema can have, but sometimes you see the impact. Take Three Girls – the BBC miniseries about the Rochdale child sexual abuse ring. People stopped me in the street wanting to talk about it, wanting to ask me questions, not about my character, but about the whole piece, about the grooming scandal, how they felt about it, how the series had changed their attitude.I don’t feel a responsibility as an actor to get people involved in politics – I think that is slightly patronising. My responsibility as an actor is to tell a good story and to play a good part. It depends on the stories you choose to tell. Of course, I am asked about my politics and therefore I am honest about my politics, but I completely understand why other actors do not want to be vocal about these things. That was never in the job description, but it is too much of who I am. I do not go around telling other people how they should feel or think. I am not a Henry Hunt – one of the main characters in Peterloo (played by Rory Kinnear). He was one of the leading orators of the time, who went around the country standing on a box making speeches, wearing his trademark white hat. There was a vanity to him, I suppose, as there is with many politicians, left and right. My grandad used to say: “Politicians, Maxine: frustrated actors.” I will admit it works the other way around sometimes, too.Watching the finished film of Peterloo, you really get an understanding of how impossible it was made for working people to get educated, but people did. They fought tooth and nail for it. They went to seek it out wherever they could, hoovering up knowledge and knowing it is power.To hear the beautiful speeches, political speeches, that the reformers make, at a time when most people were uneducated, is wonderful. Being able to speak that eloquently for that long, with so much knowledge and passion, is something I fear we are losing: that drive, that passion to self-educate. We have had that drummed out of us. Where we are now, it is not possible for hordes of people to go into further education, because of financial restrictions. People do not feel they have any power any more. We have become anaesthetised with debt and fear. We are being constantly bullied into submission.For me, this is about remembering the struggle, the heartache and the sacrifice people made in the past, but it is also about holding up a mirror to where we are now. Peterloo tells you the history of that time, but it also shows you: this could happen again. The costumes may be different, but it is the same old battle against authority, it is the constant disregard of working people, the lack of respect, the systematic bullying. I know people think I am some sort of extremist, but to me we live in a police state and it is getting progressively worse. You only have to look at the many anti-fracking demonstrations in the north where the police used extreme violence against the protesters to see that.I think the film will open people’s eyes. Next year is the 200th anniversary of Peterloo, but the timing of it – it feels as if the planets have aligned. People want change now, like they did then. I still believe that unity is strength. There is still power in mass demonstrations we must never forget that. People say they do not achieve results, but for me it is not always about being successful. It is about stemming the flow. It is about getting under the skin. It is about saying: “We’re here and we don’t agree.” If we stop standing up and shouting, we will be in a very sorry situation.As told to Steve Rose. Peterloo is released in the UK on 2 November and in the US on 5 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/367cedd6aa74fa389ef476624851b5c477bc1239/701_202_6652_3992/master/6652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b92026dd36a0836d3d300500deb21b9","title":"ray liz review brutal study of a family coming to pieces","story":"Richard Billingham’s bleak feature-directing debut captures the claustrophobic loneliness of a couple cut off from everyone, including each otherPhotographer and artist Richard Billingham makes his feature-directing debut with the bleak Ray \u0026amp Liz. It was developed from earlier video works and his 1996 collection of photographic studies, entitled Ray’s a Laugh, after the old Ted Ray radio comedy. They were stark, uncompromisingly painful shots of his hard-drinking dad, Ray, and hard-smoking mum, Liz, and originally formed part of Charles Saatchi’s YBA exhibition Sensation with Damien Hirst et al. Ray and Liz were, of course, depressed – not a diagnosis we were encouraged to make back in the ironic Cool Britannia 90s. This film version makes it clearer and expands the images’ implications into grim and sometimes funny vignettes, fragments of a fragmented family life. The whole film is like an incomplete fragment, intriguing if frustrating.Patrick Romer plays Ray as an old man, living in one room of a council flat that we will later realise was home to his family. He is all alone, like a BS Johnson or Samuel Beckett character, listening to Radio 4, and the echo of Terence Davies’ Distant Voices, Still Lives is surely deliberate. Poor Ray subsists on a liquid diet, the dodgy home brew brought round by his mate Sid, and on his memories.We flash back to Ray and Liz in Dudley in the early 80s. Ray is a sharp-faced, worried-looking guy played by Justin Salinger (who recently played the ill-fated 60s yachtsman Donald Crowhurst in Simon Rumley’s film.) Ray’s redundancy money, plus benefits and subletting a room, supports the family. Ella Smith plays his wife, the tattooed Liz, endlessly smoking (although so is everyone else), and ruminatively doing her jigsaws and sewing patches and names of heavy metal bands on to denim. Their dodgy young lodger, Will (Sam Gittins), is the metalhead, a nasty piece of work given to bullying Ray’s brother Lol (Tony Way), who has learning difficulties – as no one used to say in the 1980s.Their two boys are Richard and Jason, and when they have grown into their teens we see that the family have been moved out of their dilapidated terrace and into a forbidding high-rise block, the same block into which Ray will eventually retreat into a single room. The kids are up to all sorts of delinquent mischief, but Richard is the studious one while Jason is going off the rails. Yet it is Jason who is to provide the film’s heartrending emotional breakthrough, staying out all night away from what might be called the family home, sleeping in the garden shed belonging to the family of his mate. It is to lead to the inevitable intervention of the school and social services, and the first step towards the older Ray’s catastrophic loneliness. We are not told what has happened to Liz. Ray \u0026amp Liz has many image madeleines: big old-fashioned Lego blocks, the milk pan, the gas-fire grill glowing orange, the old payphones with slots for 2p and 10p, the ubiquitous ashtrays with cigarettes emitting the silky thread of smoke. Even Jason’s headmaster has a cigarette going. People sometimes watch TV, but without the addictive dedication they might in a later age devote to smartphones. It’s all very redolent of a past recalled without sentimentalism. But the contrast with Davies’ work is instructive. In Distant Voices, Still Lives there was sweetness to go with the cruelty there was some community spirit and pub singsongs. Not here. Ray and Liz are marooned, cut off from everyone and cut off from each other.This is a tough film to watch, at once claustrophobic and open-ended or unfinished, leaving the audience with questions, chiefly about what has happened to Liz. It’s a brutal study of a family coming to pieces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03d10efa91d24ac43f09df5f37efe7c84b360c9/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f9c7a526d946e149ecc164c16435277","title":"france germany nations league match report","story":"Antoine Griezmann scored twice in the second half as France came from behind to beat Germany in the Nations League and increase the pressure on Joachim Löw.Germany looked to be producing the desired response to a 3-0 defeat by Holland on Saturday that left them in danger of relegation when Toni Kroos scored an early penalty.The world champions regrouped following the restart, with Griezmann equalising just after the hour with a looping header.

It also lit up an otherwise gruelling spectacle that intensified the pressure on Martin O’Neill.The Republic manager was hoping for a vibrant performance that would atone for his team’s sorry 4-1 defeat by Wales last month. He told them to “show you can play, take the game by the scruff of the neck”. They tried but rarely came close.Iniduals in green made basic mistakes for which their manager could scarcely be blamed but collectively there seemed to be a haphazardness that did not reflect well on anyone involved with the home team.“I’m delighted with the endeavour but endeavour alone is not enough. We lacked a little bit of quality,” said O’Neill, who insisted he can lead the Irish to qualification for Euro 2020, especially if players such as Seamus Coleman and Robbie Brady return from injuries, adding that he continually reviews his abilities and remains convinced he will plot a successful path forward.“I’ve never not asked questions of myself,” he said. “I take responsibility for every kick made on that field by us. That’s my job. That will not change in terms of questioning. I do question everything that happens on the field. I’ll look back on the field to see if there are things we could have done better.”Both managers had promised to be bold in their approach and Giggs’s lineup backed up his words. He gave first international starts to a couple of teenagers, Leeds’s Tyler Roberts leading the attack while Matt Smith began in midfield. The experienced Sam Vokes and Andy King would have been safer options in the absence of Bale and Ramsey but Giggs put his confidence in youth as part of a plan to use speed and movement to pull Ireland apart. Their was little trace of such sharpness from either side during a first half when the ball drifted to and fro like a plastic bag in a fickle breeze.An error led to Ireland’s best chance, Smith miscontrolling at the edge of his box as Wales tried to play out from the back. Christie pounced on the error and sent a hasty curling shot towards the bottom corner, only for Wayne Hennessey to push it around the post.Injuries for both sides meant half of the participants are more commonly seen in the Championship and the match was distinctly second rate but Wales raised the standard in the second half.Wilson contributed the classiest moment in the 56th minute after an almost laughable tackle by Harry Arter at the edge of the box. Any Ireland fans thankful that Bale was not around to take the free-kick must have forgotten about the masterpiece produced by Wilson for Derby against Manchester United last month. He served up another, dispatching the free-kick into the top-right corner past a mystified Darren Randolph. “I thought about fining him after he scored at Old Trafford but I won’t be fining him now,” said Giggs, jokingly.Ireland tried to brew up a storm. Jeff Hendrick unloaded a shot after dainty footwork in the box but it was straight at Hennessey. Everything seemed a little aimless from the hosts and Wales would have inflicted more damage if Tom Lawrence and James Chester had finished better.“We played some really good stuff,” Giggs said. “But the thing I’m most proud about was that clean sheet, the will to defend and put their bodies on the line.”While hailing the contribution of his young players, he said the best player was a 34-year-old who came into the game on the back of criticism for recent displays. “Ashley Williams was outstanding, man of the match by a million miles. I get asked all the time about the young players coming in but the older, experienced one are just as important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32b00f5699f90f4d63b87d77cc3c091fe59a14f9/0_36_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e23bf8cdaea61ad6c24af030b9feacf0","title":"enormity yemen famine initially underestimated","story":"Sources say soaring food prices have overtaken projections from UN general assembly two weeks ago, with up to 14 million people now at risk The sheer magnitude of the famine facing Yemen was initially underestimated by the aid sector, leaving food security experts rushing to update projections made at the UN general assembly a fortnight ago, sources have told the .The speed at which the Yemeni currency plunged in early September, forcing food prices to soar, is being blamed for miscalculations that mean between 1.5 million and 2 million more people than initially thought are now at risk of famine.Humanitarians warn children will be worst hit in what is being forecast as the world’s most lethal famine for 100 years with up to 14 million people at risk, according to the UN.“The crisis in Yemen is so huge and of such magnitude, we have to be frank about whether we can together deal with what is facing us,” said Lise Grande, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. “We are literally looking at hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of people who may not survive.”Britain announced on Tuesday it would provide further aid to tackle malnutrition among Yemen’s children, with funding secured to help screen 2.2 million under-fives.But the news was met with cynicism from one humanitarian organisation, which criticised the UK for providing aid with one hand and arms to the Saudi-led coalition with the other.Yemen was plunged into civil war in 2015 after Houthi rebels – Shia Muslims backed by Iran – seized control of much of the country, including the capital, Sana’a. A Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign aimed at restoring President Hadi’s government, with support from the US, UK and France.The famine is being driven by economic factors caused by conflict, rather than a lack of food, experts say. The depreciation of the Yemeni currency has caused food prices to increase, while the soaring cost of fuel has made transport more expensive.In addition, importers of basics such as cooking oil, rice, sugar and butter have been prevented from entering the country due to restrictions imposed by Yemen’s central bank based in Aden, territory controlled by its exiled government.“Tens of thousands of destitute families, who were barely able to buy what they needed just a few weeks ago, can no longer afford to feed themselves at all,” Grande told the .About 8.5 million people in the Middle East’s poorest country already rely on the World Food Programme to survive, including 1 million who receive cash assistance.But if the current trend continues, as many as 5.6 million more Yemenis may need assistance to survive.Grande said: “Things are deteriorating very, very quickly. The implications of this are enormous, and, truthfully, frightening. The reality is that time may be running out.”The UN’s humanitarian lead, who met with key donors on Monday, said the agency was now scrambling to raise funds for emergency cash assistance.Grande said: “One of the fastest and most effective ways of helping destitute families is to give them cash. This allows them to buy what they need, when they need it. Humanitarians are looking at ways to expand cash programmes as quickly as possible.”Her comments came as a representative from the Norwegian Refugee Council criticised Britain for supplying arms to Saudi Arabia.Suze van Meegen, a protection and advocacy adviser for the council based in Sana’a, said: “I anticipate the calls will come for international government to inject more cash into solving the crisis.“But the crisis doesn’t lie with money. It lies in stopping the war. There is a duplicity in the UK, for example, where the British government is providing a lot of money to help us reach people with aid but it could get more bang for its buck if it just stopped selling weapons to Saudi Arabia.”Van Meegen said people are already starving to death in “very large numbers”.“From our perspective we may as well consider ourselves already in famine. This time last year we warned that 8.4 million people were already on the brink of famine. The images now speak for themselves.”She added: “There is direct violence but equally we are seeing slow systematic steps by both sides to undermine the economy. It means food is more expensive, it’s double the price it was even a few weeks ago.”Since the offensive on Hodeidah began in June, the Norwegian Refugee Council has seen the nature of its work change. Where previously it was trying to help Yemenis through assistance with education and livelihoods, the focus has shifted to survival.Van Meegen said: “Our focus is helping those people who have left home with nothing but a few items in a plastic bag with food and cash. The other thing we are doing is trucking water which is hard to come by and very expensive.”Announcing Tuesday’s aid package the minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said the money would help screen 2.2 million children under the age of five and provide urgent treatment for 70,000 of the most vulnerable youngsters.“The UK is extremely concerned at the deepening humanitarian crisis … Children are suffering the most and are 12 times more likely to die from diseases. Today’s aid package will help identify cases of malnourishment earlier and provide life-saving care for those most in need,” he said.He called on all parties to support the UN special envoy’s peace talks to find a political solution to end the conflict.The Department for International Development said the aid package of £96.5m will fund the UN children’s agency, Unicef, to tackle malnutrition over three years.

In between lie the rubble and workings of the opencast mine.The tensions between the three are now reaching a critical point. The mining company wants to dig out more coal, and has been granted rights for a vast new swath of land. Activists in Somkhele have gone to court to shut the mine, or at least stop any expansion, which mining officials say would have the same result. A judgment is due within weeks and will set a precedent that could have far-reaching consequences.“If the judge finds against us, he is saying mining companies in South Africa don’t have to comply with the law, and that is terrifying. If he finds for us, he says the law in this country is to be respected by everybody,” said Kirsten Youens, a lawyer acting for community groups in Somkhele.Jan du Preez, CEO of Petmin, the company which owns the Somkhele mine, said its operations were fully compliant with all legal requirements, and accused critics of being activists who hate mining.“It would be wonderful if the world could obtain its raw materials with zero harm, but that is in utopia,” Du Preez told the .“While the world needs environmental activists to protect against unscrupulous people, these activists also need to … actually consider the facts. Unfortunately some are idealists who would rather have a devastated economy and no jobs than a responsibly run mine. ”Across South Africa, and across the continent, there are similar confrontations as officials come under pressure to ensure economic growth – even at the cost of the environment.Thulziwe Jane Dladla, who lives in a traditional cluster of small houses and huts overlooking the Somkhele mine, listed her grievances: dust, noise and ground-shaking blasting, heavy truck traffic, inadequate compensation for households relocated and a lack of communication since mining began a little over a decade ago.“Life here is too bad,” she said.Officials at the mine, which produces rare and valuable anthracite coal used in the metal industry, say none of these complaints is justified and point out benefits to the community including more than a thousand jobs, a maternity ward for the local clinic, roads, water pipes, a school, a creche and training programmes.Du Preez said fair compensation was paid to displaced families, with the costs of moving graves of ancestors also covered by the company.The community’s traditional leaders, elected municipal officials and the mining union’s local branches almost unanimously back the mine. So too, it appears, does the government. Last month, Gwede Mantashe, minister for mineral resources, travelled to Somkhele and the site of another controversial mine, Xolobeni, where an Australian company has been trying to mine titanium, to rally support.The African National Congress, in power since South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, believe such developments will give a much-needed boost to the country’s flagging economy.But Mantashe’s trip was not a success. In Somkhele, he angered some locals by leaving them waiting for several hours before a brief meeting. In Xolobeni, his visit ended in disorder, with teargas fired by police to disperse demonstrators and a well-known environmental lawyer arrested.“The minister was disrespectful,” said Bongani Pearce, one of the Somkhele activists. “The government isn’t on our side.”Dladla, 56, admitted the community was split, with some welcoming the opportunities the mine has brought in an area where jobs are rare, especially for young people. It is these isions that pain her most.“We were a community gathering together. But the coming of the mine separated us,” she said.Activists claim that Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president since February, is biased. The liberation struggle leader turned multimillionaire businessman made a fortune in mining before returning to politics.“They are all on the side of the mines. They don’t care about small people like us,” said Dladla.ANC officials dismiss the charge as ridiculous. They argue that South Africa is still desperately poor and cannot afford to ignore the earning potential of its resources. If mining has shrunk as a proportion of GDP, the industry has long been central to the party’s plans to empower and enrich the country’s majority communities.Melissa Fourie, executive director of the Centre for Environmental Rights, said the approach was short-term.“Mining shouldn’t be seen as the solution to all problems. The government needs to be more creative in its thinking. We don’t have to destroy precious economic resources for ever,” she added.But the ANC is under pressure. Elections are due next year, and calls for rapid and radical economic transformation from populists like Julius Malema and his Economic Freedom Fighters party resonate with the millions who feel that the prosperity and equality promised when the racist apartheid regime crumbled are unfulfilled.“I don’t like the EFF’s strategy and all the confrontation, but I hear what they are saying and it makes sense,” said Dladla’s 25-year-old son, who has moved to the city of Durban, 140 miles (225km) away, to find work.With massive debts and limited revenue opportunities, ruling party officials are also desperate for foreign investment.One potential source is China, which recently promised investment of more than $1.1bn (£830m) in industrial infrastructure and plants, including a big coal mine in the north-east and a 4600MW coal-fired power station.Experts say renewable energy sources now offer a cheaper way to supply South Africa’s power needs, and would avoid extensive environmental damage.Some Somkhele inhabitants fear the coming judgement may exacerbate existing isions.“If we lose, the whole community will be torn apart. There will not be peace. There will be disorder,” said Duduzile Mkhwanazi, 36, a local farmer and mother of three.“But it is important. It is a start for us, a beginning. I don’t want my kids to grow up without jobs or schooling, but I don’t want them to grow up next to a mine either.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b044cb40213fc6fb73585eba4b36fbf15fadd05/0_8_1927_1156/master/1927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=479ffe31561ad3f9dc32c849a693c51e","title":"ladbible snaps up social media rival unilad","story":"Takeover exposes financial challenges in face of success on FacebookUniLad has been bought by its arch-rival internet company LadBible following a takeover process that laid bare the financial challenges facing online publishers.The two British companies – who were competitors but have an entangled history – are the two biggest publishers on Facebook, thanks to their combination of viral videos and understanding of how to game the social network’s algorithm. This makes them bigger outfits on the social network than the likes of the BBC, CNN and New York Times.But despite their enormous scale, the latest company accounts suggest the combined annual revenue of both UniLad and LadBible is about £25m, a fraction of the income that traditional media used to enjoy.UniLad employs more than 200 staff, many of whom are young graduates based in its Manchester editorial office who had feared their company could be mothballed by LadBible. However, they have been told that they will be kept as a separate business in the wider group with no immediate job losses.“There will be an assessment period where they talk to all of us and come up with a business plan,” said one employee, adding that the long-term outcome “may include downsizing” and staff were prepared for redundancies.Others said the new management had done their best to reassure UniLad employees that the company had a future.“There’s a very mixed feeling among the staff – some dreading the future, some remaining positive as it could become a better run company with more opportunities,” said one.UniLad’s former management repeatedly complained about the administration process, claiming it was skewed to favour LadBible and excluded rival bidders.LadBible had helped to force UniLad into administration in the first place by buying up £5m of the company’s debt, with the entire administration process completed within a fortnight. The final sum paid for UniLad has not been disclosed, although the company had total debts of about £10m, including £1.5m owed to the taxman.LadBible said the deal “makes us the largest social video publisher ever” with more than 120 million followers. “In August alone, our combined videos were viewed 4.5bn times. We believe that the Unilad Group brands complement our existing offering and we can promise our audience more of the stuff they love from all the brands in the new LadBible Group family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f716e40f33ad4f25410dbe46afeac439231ae4e/0_120_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=148893fee4591fc78ac1a6de95e7e7bf","title":"netflix shares new members report","story":"New member total is record for the quarter and ahead of analyst expectations, erasing fears that growth has slowedNetflix shares soared on Tuesday as the streaming service announced higher growth than expected numbers of new subscribers.The company added 6.96 million new members in the last three months, a record for the quarter and well ahead of analysts expectations, erasing fears that its growth had slowed.

Morgan posted a photo of Daniel Craig who was holding his child in a sling with the caption: “Oh 007.. not you as well?!!! #papoose #emasculatedBond.”With no one willing to tell Morgan that James Bond is not a real person, it was left for commenters to attack Morgan’s fragile understanding of fatherhood, including Captain America star Chris Evans, who accused Morgan of being “uncertain of your own masculinity” and “terrified on the inside”.Morgan spent almost the entire day on Twitter reiterating his comments and delightedly arguing with detractors. In one moment of attention-seeking desperation he even tried to involve Donald Trump, tweeting: “Do you have a view about papooses, Mr President @realDonaldTrump? … I don’t really have you down as a papoose kinda guy, but then you’re full of surprises.”When that didn’t work, he tweeted this disturbing image.Wiz Khalifa is an American rapper best known for his hit Black and Yellow, yet despite this he’s not a fan of the only fruit that is both colours. Appearing on Hot 97’s The Breakfast Club, Khalifa explained his theory that men shouldn’t eat bananas.“If you bite a banana, you sus,” he said, using a slang term for “suspicious” that many commentators believe was used in this context to mean homosexual.When challenged by the hosts, Khalifa clarified his rules by saying that men who insisted on eating the fruit and are “in public” should “break it into pieces” first, presumably because there is nothing more masculine than preparing fruit the same way you would for a small child.Facebook has around 2.25 billion users and, according to one brand of tonic water, they’re all a bunch of kiddiewinks. Schweppes ran a series of adverts that promised the drink has been “separating boys since 1783”, including one which read: “Men have status, boys are busy updating theirs.” The ad was posted on parent company Coca-Cola’s social media channels.Mike Pence once said in an interview that he would never dine alone with a woman who wasn’t his wife, nor would he attend a party where they were serving alcohol without her. You might think that would cause an issue, considering how much of Washington decision-making happens in casual environments. But the vice-president has thought of a way round that: he works in a White House that has appointed the fewest number of women since the Reagan administration and has thus massively reduced any chance of being left alone with one of them.It’s maybe not surprising that someone married to Rod Stewart isn’t too bothered about updating their conceptions of masculinity. Appearing on the Loose Women talkshow, Lancaster explained that while she “does agree with equal rights and if women want to go and work that’s fabulous”, she still believes that men who go “as far as cooking and putting the apron on, I think that, not belittles men, but takes the masculinity”.Considering Lancaster’s 1950s views you might think she has dinner ready for Rod every night when he gets home, but in the same interview she explained the couple instead employ a personal chef. “I do still go to the supermarket because I like to stay connected to reality,” she said.

Mujtaba Rahman, of Eurasia Group, said: “It’s simply inconceivable that the EU will hand the UK the right to exit the backstop at a time of the UK’s choosing.”A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Cabinet members had been urged to rise up and rebel against the prime minister’s Brexit strategy by the former Brexit secretary David Davis over the weekend.Cabinet members including Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, have privately said the UK should insist on a firm date for ending the backstop.Similar concerns were voiced by Conservative Brexiters in the Commons on Monday, when May updated MPs on the status of the Brexit negotiations, with the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith asking the prime minister: “How long does she think this temporary arrangement might last and, most importantly, who would make the final decision on when it ends?”A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free-trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. May has suggested to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate that proposal.As a result, the EU is continuing to insist on having its own backstop, which would mean Northern Ireland remaining in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free-trade agreement, prompting fierce objections from Tory hard Brexiters and the Democratic Unionist party, which props up her government.The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: “It is simply extraordinary that the cabinet can’t agree what its plan for Brexit is. If the cabinet can’t make a decision on Brexit, then what on earth is the point of it? Theresa May is in office, not in power.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b1cffb72e72346e45bd816b41a984ebe0e0bb68/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76ecefb2928a18faf8535575e9fcf5dd","title":"divided britain study finds huge chasm in attitudes","story":"Far-right and anti-Islam ideas taking root in post-industrial towns, says Hope Not Hate Britain is hugely ided across cultural, age and education lines, a major study of national attitudes has concluded, warning of a potential rise in far-right and anti-Islam sentiments unless politicians tackle long-standing disaffections behind the Brexit vote.There is a particular chasm between people living in affluent, multicultural cities and those from struggling post-industrial towns, according to the report from Hope Not Hate, based on six years of polling and focus groups.The study by the anti-fascism advocacy group uncovers the often glaring extent of geographic splits between people of varying attitudes, with opposition to immigration and multiculturalism correlating closely with socio-economic deprivation.It found that of the 100 areas where people were most likely to oppose immigration, all were in towns or on the outskirts of cities, with 93 of them in the Midlands or north of England.Another key finding of the 60-page report, which links Hope Not Hate’s years of polling 43,000 people with data from other organisations, is that while overall attitudes to multiculturalism are softening, the opposite is happening with Islam.On attitudes specifically to Islam, however, the report found that while these softened between 2011 and 2016, this process then reversed, something it put down the series of terror attacks in the UK in 2017 and media coverage of sexual grooming gangs in places such as Rotherham.An attempt to locate centres of strongly anti-Muslim or far-right sentiment, done by mapping the locations of people who signed an online petition seeking the release from prison of the anti-Islam activist known as Tommy Robinson, found a strong link to the deprived towns associated with Brexit and more general opposition to immigration.Conversely, the study concluded, areas where people feel more in control of own lives and optimistic about their futures “become more resilient to hateful narratives and to political manifestations of this hatred”.It found that such isions closely correlate with people’s votes over Brexit, noting that opposition to the EU and prejudice towards Islam “are clearly interlinked issues for many”.But, it warned, departure from the EU alone is extremely unlikely to tackle the reasons why people in such poorer towns and city suburbs tend to be wary of change and hostile to immigration.In particular, it found, reducing immigration levels alone will not alleviate anxiety about new arrivals, not least since those most likely to express those views are based predominantly in areas where few immigrants actually live.The report concluded that people in deprived communities often saw immigration as part of “a broader story about dissatisfaction with their own lives”, repeating stories from the media about immigrants supposedly receiving preferential treatment from public services.“Immigration has become a totemic emblem for the many grievances people feel in modern Britain,” said Nick Lowles, the chief executive of Hope Not Hate, in an introduction to the report.“The strong view in many of these communities is that they have been abandoned and left to rot by the political establishment in preference to addressing the needs and wishes of new arrivals in the cities.”The only way to tackle such views would be to rebuild such neglected communities, Lowles said, “equipping their young people with the skills that will enable them to compete more effectively in the modern global world and, fundamentally, giving them a sense of hope in the future”.Another key ide, also strongly manifested in the Brexit vote, is age, with younger people found to be notably less likely to see immigration as a significant national problem or to worry about Islamist terrorism.While affluent people in cities tended to be more optimistic about the future than those in deprived towns, this process was reversed when it came to one thing: Brexit.Hope Not Hate identify two places as a study in contrasts: East Marsh in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, and the Castle area of Cambridge. They are, the report says “each one of two Englands, emerging as the most hostile and most confidently multicultural places on our heatmap”.Grimsby as a whole is marked by deprivation and decline, caused by a diminished industrial base and fishing trade, as well as low skill levels.Interviews in the area for the report uncovered a sense of loss at the decline in fishing and the associated prosperity and worries about immigration.One interviewee complained the immigrants were “just coming in and taking our resources”. They added: “I’ve got to wait until I’m 67 instead of retiring at 60 now to get my pension.”In contrast, the study highlights Castle as emblematic of the urban-based, university-linked areas most commonly associated with the so-called “confident multiculturals”, those at ease with a changing UK.A central area of Cambridge, Castle covers St John’s College and the surrounding, prosperous residential area. Its levels of income, employment and adult skills are among the country’s highest.The report says: “Many of its residents are employees of Cambridge university and many more are students residing in and around the grounds of the impressive, elite colleges. The area is both pretty and prosperous, where few of its residents are dependent children or retirees. Economic concerns are uncommon in areas such as this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79f315f1b427a44369339e876644a922eae92b80/0_316_4548_2729/master/4548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58ae200c4d99eb9309a7bc19d30452a8","title":"research finds link between time online and obesity in children","story":"Heavy use of the internet and watching commercial TV increase desire for junk foodYoung children who spend a lot of time online or watching commercial television are much more likely to be obese and ask their parents to buy them junk food, a new survey has found.Children who use the internet for more than half an hour a day are almost twice as likely as those who do not, to pester their parents for chocolate, crisps, sugary drinks and takeaways, according to research by Cancer Research UK.Primary school aged children who spend more than three hours a day online are more likely to spend their pocket money on such products than those who are online for less than 30 minutes.The findings, from CRUK’s cancer policy research centre and academics from Liverpool University are based on a survey of almost 2,500 children aged between seven and 11 and their parents about food intake and viewing habits.“Parents are all too familiar with being nagged for sweets and fizzy drinks in the supermarket or corner shop. Our research shows that this behaviour can be linked to the amount of time children spend in front of a screen and as a result the increased number of enticing adverts they see for these sorts of products,” said Emma Boyland, a lead researcher from Liverpool University.Overall, children are typically online for 16 hours a week and spend 22 hours a week watching television. Children who watch the most commercial TV are most likely to want their parents to buy them food they have seen advertised, with every extra hour of TV increasing the chances of that happening.“Children see as many as nine junk food adverts during one 30-minute episode of their favourite TV shows, so it’s not surprising this leads them to pester for, buy and eat more unhealthy foods”, said Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance, a group of medical bodies and health charities.Ministers recently published plans to tackle the growing childhood obesity epidemic by ending “buy one get one free” offers on sweet treats, banning junk food ads before the 9pm watershed and other measures.

I don’t like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I’m concerned,” Trump said.However, Erdoğan has made the international defence of Saudi Arabia harder by revealing that some areas at the Saudi consulate where Khashoggi was last seen alive had been repainted and that toxic materials had been found by police. Turkish sources allege the body was transported to the consul general’s house nearby and disposed of.Mohammad al-Otaibi, the consul general, has not been seen in public since the scandal erupted. Turkish television and semi-official Anadolu news agency said on Tuesday evening that he left Turkey on a commercial flight hours before his residence was expected to be searched.Pompeo is to meet Erdoğan and his foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Wednesday morning, state department officials said. The initial plan was to meet in Ankara but the latest report from journalists travelling with Pompeo was that the meeting would take place at Istanbul airport.Earlier, the secretary of state described his day of meetings in Riyadh, with King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, as “incredibly successful” because they had each promised to carry out a “thorough, complete and transparent investigation”.“They made a commitment they would show the entire world the result of their investigation. They also indicated they would get this done quickly,” Pompeo told reporters as he boarded his plane for Turkey. “They made a commitment to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.”Asked if that might include a member of the royal family, the secretary of state replied: “They made no exceptions to who they would hold accountable.”Trump’s latest remarks were his most robust defence yet of the Saudis, a US ally he has made central to his Middle East agenda. They put the president at odds with other key allies and with some leaders in his Republican party who have condemned the Saudi leadership for what they say is an obvious role in the case. Trump appeared willing to resist the pressure to follow suit, accepting Saudi denials and their pledge to investigate.The Oval Office interview came not long after Trump spoke on Tuesday to the Saudi crown prince. He spoke by phone a day earlier with Bin Salman’s father, King Salman, and he said both deny any knowledge of what happened to Khashoggi.After speaking to the king, Trump floated the idea that “rogue killers” may have been responsible for the disappearance. The president told the Associated Press on Tuesday that that description was informed by his “feeling” from his conversation with Salman, and that the king did not use the term.Earlier, Erdoğan said: “My hope is that we can reach conclusions that will give us a reasonable opinion as soon as possible, because the investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over,” he said.As police vans pulled up outside the consul general’s residence on Tuesday, Pompeo, met for crisis talks in Riyadh with Bin Salman and his father.At their afternoon meeting at the Royal Palace, Pompeo and the crown prince exchanged smiles and pleasantries about whether the secretary of state was feeling jetlag. Before reporters were ushered out, the prince said: “We are strong and old allies. We face our challenges together.”After a second session of talks with the crown prince over dinner, Pompeo declared himself satisfied the Saudi monarchy was making a serious effort to find out what happened in the Istanbul consulate.“During each of today’s meetings, the Saudi leadership strongly denied any knowledge of what took place in their consulate in Istanbul,” the secretary of state said in a written statement. “My assessment from these meetings is that there is serious commitment to determine all the facts and ensure accountability, including accountability for Saudi Arabia’s senior leaders or senior officials.”Later on Tuesday, the New York Times reported that four of the Saudi suspects had links to the security detail of the crown prince, citing social media profiles, leaked records and use of facial recognition software.Saudi cooperation is critical to three Trump foreign policy goals: isolating Iran, defeating Islamic State and being able to claim Arab support for a planned Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.While US media had been reporting that the Saudis were poised to acknowledge that the missing journalist had died as part of a botched rendition attempt, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said on Tuesday that Riyadh had not offered any explanation to Turkey.Last week, Trump threatened “severe punishment” if it emerged that Khashoggi had been assassinated.However, the US president said on Monday, without offering evidence, that Khashoggi could have been murdered by “rogue killers”, prompting speculation that the White House may be willing to protect the House of Saud.But Senator Lindsey Graham, an influential Republican ally of Trump, described the crown prince, known by his initials as MBS, as “toxic” and accused him of ordering Khashoggi’s death. “Nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without MBS knowing it,” he told Fox News, warning that Congress would “sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia” over Khashoggi’s disappearance.Turkish officials continued to leak to news outlets on Tuesday that police found evidence in the nearby consulate building during Monday’s search that proved Khashoggi was killed there.Of particular interest to the forensics team in the new search is the garden, where it is believed the journalist’s remains could have been buried, and a garage under the house, where cars with diplomatic plates spent several hours after driving from the consulate building on the day he vanished. At least four diplomatic vehicles are included in the investigation.Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, relocated from Saudi Arabia to the US last year, where he wrote for the Washington Post. He visited the Saudi consulate building in Istanbul on 2 October for an appointment to pick up documents for his forthcoming marriage.Turkish officials allege they have video and audio evidence that proves Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered by a 15-man hit squad sent from Riyadh. Saudi Arabia says the claims are false, although it has offered no alternative version of events.On Tuesday, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, urged Ankara and Riyadh to waive diplomatic immunity in the case and “reveal everything they know about the disappearance and possible extrajudicial killing” of Khashoggi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9499f08e89d2c34cac272a459006f0dee29d0b36/0_344_5157_3094/master/5157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b102cf3f9032dab47142a201fabfc02","title":"there is hope here fukushima turns to tourism after nuclear meltdown","story":"The region may forever be associated with catastrophe, but some residents want the world to know that life goes onEven now, almost eight years after a deadly earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the disaster’s physical legacy is impossible to avoid.The shells of gutted homes stand in barren rice paddies that lay in the path of waves that killed more than 18,000 people across three prefectures in north-east Japan – including 1,600 in Fukushima – on the afternoon of 11 March 2011.The Fukushima brand may forever be associated with nuclear catastrophe, but some residents, angered by persistent rumours about the dangers of even making brief visits to the area, are turning to tourism to show the world that, for some, life in Fukushima goes on.“The people around here aren’t happy with the idea they live in a ‘dark” place,” says Shuzo Sasaki, a prefectural government official who also works as a guide for Real Fukushima, one of several organisations offering tours to small groups of visitors.“The idea that because this is Fukushima it must be dangerous is completely wrong,” adds Sasaki, who has guided students from the Georgia Institute of Technology and will host a group of Danish high school pupils next year.The challenge facing residents desperate to change the Fukushima narrative was highlighted this summer with the release of “Dark Tourist”, a Netflix series hosted by the New Zealand journalist David Farrier.In one episode, Farrier and several foreign tourists were shown glued to their Geiger counters as they were driven around the area in a minibus, with some becoming visibly distressed when radiation readings spiked.When they reluctantly ate lunch at a restaurant, Farrier speculated that his meal might be contaminated, even though the official threshold for radioactive substances in food from Fukushima is much lower than those in the European Union and the US.In some decontaminated parts of Fukushima, radiation levels have fallen to the government target of 0.23 microsieverts an hour, or 1 millisievert a year assuming that an inidual spends eight hours outdoors and 16 hours indoors each day. By comparison, the global average exposure of humans to ionizing radiation is between 2.4 and 3 millisieverts a year.Karin Taira, a Real Fukushima guide who runs the Lantern House, a guesthouse in the Odaka district, claims the Netflix documentary overstated the risk posed by radiation and painted an unrelentingly negative picture of the area. “It gave the impression that this place is hopeless,” she says. “But there is hope here.”But there are also reminders of the devastation unleashed by the tsunami and the nuclear meltdown.On a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a memorial lists the names of 182 people who were swept away to their deaths in the town of Namie. Inland, just beyond the tsunami’s destructive reach, is evidence of a different kind of tragedy. At Kumamachi primary school, just two kilometres from the wrecked nuclear plant, classrooms appear frozen in time, with books, bags and other possessions abandoned when the order to evacuate was given. Outside, wild grass and weeds are reclaiming streets where wild boar and raccoons roam, untroubled by humans.Only a small number of the 150,000 people evacuated after the triple meltdown have returned to areas deemed safe by the government. Some parents are concerned about their children’s long-term exposure to radiation, amid evidence that in some areas levels are higher than the government claims. Others have built new lives elsewhere and see no compelling reason to return to areas whose economies were ruined by the disaster.But a semblance of civic life is returning to some towns and villages, which before the tsunami were known for their farm produce and seafood. This summer, a beach 40km north of Fukushima Daichi reopened after seven years. Farmers are replanting rice and other crops, and fishermen have returned to the sea. Solar plants have been built in abandoned fields, although they are dwarfed by the estimated 16m bags containing radioactive topsoil removed from the region during a huge decontamination effort.Fukushima City will host baseball and football matches during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and J Village, commandeered in the aftermath of the meltdown to host thousands of workers and their equipment, has been restored to its original role as a football coaching centre.In the town of Okuma, local official Shuyo Shiga and his colleagues are preparing for the opening next April of a new town office, apartments and shops following the partial lifting of the evacuation order. There are also loose plans to refurbish traditional Japanese houses and advertise them though Airbnb.“Visitors who come for the first time are amazed that there are people actually living here,” Shiga says.Takahiro Kanno has seen his hotel, located by the coast in the city of Minamisoma, transform from lodgings for power plant and decontamination workers into a destination for tourists and parties of schoolchildren.“It’s still difficult to encourage people to come, but those who do are amazed to see that people living so close to the nuclear power plant are leading normal lives again.”Nora Redmond, an Australian who was touring the area with her husband Billy and their daughter Ciara, said they had “done their homework” on the risks posed by radiation and had no concerns for their health during the several hours they spent in areas close to Fukushima Daiichi.“We heard that the region was suffering from depopulation so we thought it would be a good idea to spend some time and money up here,” Redmond says.“I didn’t realise the scale of the devastation, that people’s whole history has gone. We must have seen 20 houses being pulled down as we were driving around. You could see the beautiful wooden interiors … and they were being reduced to rubble. That was what struck me most.”Fukushima residents balk at the suggestion that they are victims – a label that ignores the pockets of economic activity sprouting up in communities where radiation levels have been brought down to government-set targets. In Europe, average natural background exposure ranges from below 2 millisieverts a year in Britain to more than 7 millisieverts in Finland, according to the pro-nuclear lobby group the World Nuclear Association.“It will take years for this and other neighbourhoods to look like they did before the disaster,” Kanno concedes. “In the meantime, we want tourists to come and see for themselves and to learn what life is really like here. But this is just a start.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b1cffb72e72346e45bd816b41a984ebe0e0bb68/0_101_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373ca27fe6f00ad80f080fe8b130403c","title":"wednesday briefing britains better vs worse off divide on immigration","story":"Stark contrast between affluent city dwellers and those in deprived areas … PM in Brussels for more Brexit talks … and China’s ‘broken porcelain’ tacticsHello – Warren Murray at your elbow as you metaphorically dip your toe into the waters of news.British attitudes on immigration are hugely ided across cultural, age and education lines, with big gaps between people in affluent, multicultural cities and those from struggling and deprived areas, a major study concludes.

It warns of a potential rise in far-right and anti-Islam sentiments unless politicians tackle disaffections behind the vote for Brexit.The 100 areas where people are most likely to oppose immigration are in towns or on the outskirts of cities, with 93 of them in the Midlands or north of England. “The strong view in many of these communities is that they have been abandoned and left to rot by the political establishment in preference to addressing the needs and wishes of new arrivals in the cities,” said Nick Lowles, the chief executive of Hope Not Hate.‘Golden passport’ revelations – Europe’s security is being put at risk by states selling citizenship or residency to potentially dangerous iniduals, the EU justice commissioner Věra Jourová has warned. Malta and Cyprus are named in an OECD blacklist of 21 nations operating such schemes. They have sold citizenship to hundreds of iniduals from Russia, China and the Middle East. “If in one country a dangerous person gets citizenship, he gets citizenship for the whole of Europe,” said Jourová, who is due to issue a report recommending much tighter controls. A Swiss businessman named Christian Kälin has become known as the “passport king” having made millions fostering the trade in small countries. Jourová was speaking to mark the first anniversary of the death of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed in a car bomb attack in Malta.Khashoggi crisis – Turkey’s president has said parts of the Saudi consulate were freshly painted, possibly to hide “toxic materials”, after US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared from there. Donald Trump has pushed a softened line overnight, calling for the Saudis not to be treated as “guilty until proven innocent … We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh”. The remarks stand at odds with condemnation both internationally and from senior figures within Trump’s own Republican party who say the culpability of the Saudi leadership is obvious. Mike Pompeo has visited Saudi Arabia for talks with the de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and his father, King Salman. After declaring those talks a success, the US secretary of state has moved on to Turkey to meet President Erdoğan.– Theresa May will urge EU leaders in Brussels today to keep the door open in Brexit negotiations.

It is “incredibly original”, according to the Booker’s chair of judges, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, who called it “challenging, but in the way a walk up Snowdon is challenging. It is definitely worth it because the view is terrific when you get to the top.”Slippery when wet – Scientists say they have developed a self-lubricating condom aimed at making safe sex go more smoothly. Boston University researchers, led by Prof Mark Grinstaff, treated latex with a water-loving polymer and there is really no tasteful way for the Briefing to explain further so close to breakfast time.Earlier this month a journalist from state-owned China Central Television shouted down a speech about Hong Kong during the Tory conference in Birmingham. She was asked to leave – and slapped a party activist on her way out. The Chinese embassy in London demanded an apology. Last month, in Sweden, a group of Chinese people had to be evicted from a hotel after demanding to sleep in the lobby. A video emerged online of them screaming and throwing themselves on the pavement. It was accompanied by criticism from the Chinese foreign ministry of this “brutal treatment”.David Bandurski, from the University of Hong-Kong’s China Media Project, says both incidents follow a familiar pattern from Chinese authorities of pengci, or “porcelain bumping”: manufacturing a drama to obtain a desired outcome. China’s state press is practised at publishing shrill denunciations that garner press coverage in the west. When the video came out, the Communist party’s arch-nemesis the Dalai Lama happened to have just visited Sweden, while Beijing and Stockholm remain at odds over the disappearance of Hong Kong-based bookseller Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen. “The danger,” writes Bandurski, “is that such histrionics could make European governments, universities, scholars and journalists … retreat from issues likely to prompt an outburst. Europe must send a message that it welcomes free, open and calm discussion of all issues, and that it will not suspend its values or the rights of its citizens to appease China’s official bouts of anger.”Ryan Giggs had challenged his young team to prove they could cope without Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey Harry Wilson duly offered evidence with a superb free-kick as Wales intensified the pressure on Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill with a 1-0 Nations League win.

Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But such is the magnitude of his lead, and the lack of penetration by any of his rivals, that only Higgins could beat himself now. And while that may be possible, it is extremely unlikely, to put it mildly.Whatever its other merits, Higgins’s strategy of campaigning on his own terms has so far a canny political judgment. He has shipped criticism from many political commentators, desperate for a competition, and has been accused of treating his opponents, and the process, with contempt.They are understandable charges, and Higgins’s answer – that he is unselfishly protecting the office of the presidency to his own cost as a candidate – takes some neck. He has brushed aside questions about spending in the Áras, promising more information once the election is over. He has glided through respectful interrogations ever watchful for lese-majeste.There’s no sign that the public cares one whit. Who knows: they may be grateful to Higgins for the lack of fuss.They are certainly unenthused, to put it mildly, by Higgins’s slate of challengers. Higgins dominates not only because he is so popular, but because the non-Higgins vote is dispersed between five candidates – none of whom have managed to get a head of steam.Seán Gallagher at 12 per cent and Liadh Ní Riada at 11 per cent are the only ones who have registered with the public at all. Gallagher’s campaign is a pale shadow of his 2011 performance which had him on course to take the presidency until his spectacular flameout in the final days. Why is this? Likely because Gallagher’s pitch hasn’t changed, and the country has.Ní Riada’s anaemic numbers might give her party pause for thought. Yesterday’s poll showed that the Sinn Féin brand has never been stronger. But Ní Riada’s United Ireland message has flopped. That must be unsettling for Sinn Féin.The remaining candidates – Gavin Duffy, Peter Casey and Joan Freeman – seem set for little return for a lot of money and effort. Duffy’s campaign especially has mystified observers who have watched and heard a reputed communications expert make such a mess of his communications.Presidential campaigns have tended to get sharper and dirtier as polling day approaches. Perhaps his opponents will throw everything they have at Michael D perhaps they will decide turning negative isn’t worth it at this stage.

Photograph: ©INPHOBryan KeaneMichael D Higgins commands a huge lead over his rivals and is almost certain to be re-elected President of Ireland for another seven years when voters go to the polls next week.With just over a week of campaigning to go, the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll finds Mr Higgins’s lead is of near-unassailable proportions, and it would take an electoral earthquake to defeat him at this stage.Despite criticisms of Mr Higgins for failing to engage in some debates, none of Mr Higgins’s rivals have made a significant impression with voters, with only two of the five challengers to the incumbent registering support in double figures.The support for the candidates among respondents who expressed a preference is as follows: Michael D Higgins 66 per cent Sean Gallagher 12 per cent Liadh Ni Riada 11 per cent Joan Freeman 5 per cent Gavin Duffy 4 per cent and Peter Casey 2 per cent. The poll was conducted on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week among a representative sample of 1,200 voters aged 18 and over in face-to-face interviews at 120 sampling points in all constituencies. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.8 per cent.If anything like the figures in today’s poll were repeated on election day, Mr Higgins would be re-elected on the first count, with no distribution of second preferences. He could lose significant support between now and polling day and still win on the first count. The poll puts Mr Higgins on twice as many votes as all his opponents combined.Support for Mr Higgins is highest in Dublin and in Munster, where he enjoys 71 per cent of first preferences, according to the poll. He is at 60 per cent in both Munster and Connacht-Ulster. Better-off voters, farmers and voters in urban areas are most likely to support Mr Higgins, but he will win votes in large numbers across all ages, classes and geographical areas.In the referendum on removing references to blasphemy in the Constitution, a bare majority of voters (51 per cent) favour removal, as advocated by the Government.Just under one in five voters (19 per cent) favour the retention of the article, while a quarter (25 per cent) say that they don’t know. This suggests that the referendum is on course to pass – though a combination of a low turnout on the day and a swing to the No side in the final weeks, which often happens in such referendums, could undermine the certainty of that outcome. Support for the referendum proposals is highest in Dublin, among younger voters and among better-off voters.

But strangely, for the first part of the presidential campaign, Liadh Ní Riada went off-radar. She had next to zero national visibility. Given that her national profile wasn’t exactly high wattage to begin with, it was an unusual strategy.That seemed to be borne out by the first opinion polls that put her support levels at single digits, and suggested more Sinn Féin supporters would be backing Michael D Higgins than her.So where was she and what was she up to? Well, it seems she was focusing on a “ground war” in local media and communities.“I hope the next polls are different and with the national debates hopefully people will see the cut of my jib,” she responds.Ní Riada certainly has her work cut out in the capital. We walk down Grafton Street following the exactly same route Michael D Higgins had taken a week before. He was mobbed. For part of her journey, Ní Riada could be just another midday browser, such is the inattention.Ní Riada (50) is as close as you could get to the image Sinn Féin wants to project right now. She is a post-conflict politician, female, modern, articulate, cultured and a native Irish speaker. She is personable and even in temperament. But even a modern Sinn Féiner, politically, is in a state of original sin. She has spent a lot of time in this campaign justifying events and actions that predated her own interest in politics.It is a Tuesday morning and we travel on Ní Riada’s impressive bus (featuring huge images of her, Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill) from RTÉ to the city centre. The main canvass is a walk through the shopping districts of Dublin 2.It is not as if Ní Riada is ignored. Some do approach having seen her on TV in the past week. A woman asks here how she thought she did on Frontline. She responds that she did okay but regrets “taking a pop” at Joan Freeman over her donor, saying she did not mean to phrase it in that way. A few others say they will support her.Ní Riada’s own life has had its share of sadness. She was an infant, the youngest of seven, when her father, composer Seán Ó Riada died. “My dad died in 1971. He was only 40. It struck me how much he achieved. I’m 10 years older than that now and I think, crikey, he left an enormous legacy.“It made us very close as a family, particularly when my mother died when I was 10.“It was tough as a teenager growing up without the influence of a parent . . . It was a noisy enough household, seven kids left to their own devices. It was a bit of a railway station, we had lots of people coming in and out. We had great neighbours.”There was little income in the house, mostly intermittent royalties from their father’s music but they got by. She spoke no English until she went to school.“I remember my first word in English which was dog. I thought everybody in Ireland spoke Irish. I remember going into a shop with my sister in Kenmare when I was quite young which is only over the mountain from us and the shopkeeper said, are you foreigners?“I thought it was extraordinary that she did not know we were speaking our native tongue.”Her first husband, Fiachra, died from malignant melanoma, a year after they married. She was 29, he younger. It was beyond sad.“Even though we both knew he had cancer, we had this thing of love will conquer everything and we will get through . . . He went very fast in the end.“It’s not something you ever get over. It’s something you get through,” she reflects.Later, she met and married Nicky Forde - “He is just a tremendous support” – and the couple have three daughters.Having been a TV director for over a decade, she entered Sinn Féin as Irish language officer, never having been involved with politics or a party. She says that move wakened a nascent republicanism within her.But how did she reconcile that with all the egregious actions of the IRA during the conflict? Is there anything, past or present, that made her uncomfortable?No, is her response. “Maybe it has to do with my own background. You accept and acknowledge the good and the ugly of the past but you don’t let it define what you do in the future.“For me, it’s about the future and ensuring generations to come will not be bogged down in this but it’s always important to acknowledge those awful dark days.”But isn’t the Máiría Cahill case a good example of Sinn Féin generalising the response and muddying the waters by saying everybody was to blame?“I think what happened to Máiría Cahill was absolutely wrong. I condemn it in all its forms. Sinn Féin at the time did not have mandatory checks and they should have been in place. They are now in place. This would never happen again and it should not have happened,” she responds.Last month Ms Cahill rejected an apology from Sinn Féin as “woefully inadequate” after Ms McDonald expressed regret for how it handled her allegation of rape. Ms Cahill claimed she had been raped by an IRA member and said she was later subjected to an IRA “kangaroo court” investigation.Ms Ní Riada has shipped criticism for her pay (which is well above the average industrial wage which Sinn Féin representatives are supposedly pegged to) and over her comments on the HPV vaccine which protects against cervical cancer.She steadfastly refuses to say if her daughters were vaccinated against HPV, on the grounds of their right to privacy. It leaves her open to criticism that she publicly supports the vaccine, but privately harbours doubt.“Let me be so clear. Privately, publicly, anyway I am completely in favour of the vaccine. I was never against it. The only thing I will guard fiercely is the privacy of my children.“I made the mistake of not guarding it two years ago and I have been paying for it since. It would be easier for me to say, you know, to give the information out but I won’t betray the confidence and trust of my kids.”Key planks of her campaign include the Irish language, conversations on a united Ireland, and social justice. A lot of that is overtly political. Won’t she have to press the mute button on all that if she become president?In particular, is not her intention to visit Palestine a political act, given some Irish people would disagree with her stance? She points, in response, to Oireachtas recognition for the state of Palestine.“It’s on a peacekeeping level you are going trying to show some solidarity to the people, that that would be the context. The atrocities being committed are horrendous. Naturally I would need permission from the Government. It would do nothing but help peace.”And would she visit Israel?“If I had to, I would yes. It’s about having uncomfortable conversations. I am not going to shy away from visiting or meeting anybody who is completely unwholesome.“You have to be balanced. I think it would be right to put that in the schedule.”Like other candidates, she thinks the media and political establishment have given Michael D Higgins too soft and too easy a time.“His level of activities has gone down and he has not addressed the Houses of the Oireachtas.“He has not made his mark. One term is enough for anybody.The Áras should not be some kind of winding-down gift to somebody who has had a long career in politics,” she claims.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":null,"title":"michael d higgins 54 points ahead in position that looks unassailable","story":"Michael D Higgins is streets ahead of all other candidates in the race to become the next President of Ireland. Today’s poll registers first preference voting intention for the incumbent at 66 per cent when undecided voters are excluded.The latest Ipsos MRBI poll gives Higgins an impressive 54-point lead with less than two weeks of the campaign to run. With five other candidates on the ballot the remainder of votes is highly fragmented, which is to the incumbent’s advantage.Today’s Ipsos MRBI poll was conducted between Wednesday and Friday of last week among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 eligible voters. Each voter was shown a ballot paper and asked to choose their first and second preference voting intention.This latest poll confirms strong support for Higgins across all age groups, ranging from 62 per cent among the youngest voter cohort (18-24 years) to 64 per cent among those aged over 50 years. Higgins is popular with both male voters (on 67 per cent) and female voters (on 65 per cent). Voters from the professional classes (ABs) are especially supportive (on 74 per cent), as too are those from farming backgrounds (on 71 per cent).Support for Higgins only dips below 60 per cent among working class (DE) voters, where he registers 57 per cent support.Ní Riada is the only candidate running under a party banner. While she is supported by 36 per cent of Sinn Féin voters, Higgins is even more popular (on 42 per cent) among this group.The current President is running as an Independent and this is reflected in the high level of support (above 70 per cent) he receives from supporters of all parties, bar Sinn Féin.Four counts were required to determine the final outcome of the 2011 presidential election. Should more than one count be required this time around, transfers will come into play.If Higgins is not elected on the first count, the likelihood is that he will be elected on transfers. The incumbent receives the highest level of second preferences from all candidates except for Peter Casey.Presidential elections have changed in recent times, becoming more about personality and less about party politics. The first political poll conducted by Ipsos MRBI was commissioned by Fine Gael to measure support for the candidates in the 1973 presidential election. At that time there were only two candidates running, Fianna Fáil’s Erskine Childers and Fine Gael’s Tom O’Higgins.Presidential elections nowadays are less predictable because the anchor of party allegiance has been largely removed. Consequently, we have come to expect a degree of volatility in presidential election polling. That said, Higgins’s lead is of such magnitude that an eruption of volcanic proportions is needed to prevent a second term."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3665302.1539725162!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit barnier open to extending uk transition period report","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May has urged the European Union not to allow a stand-off over the so-called Irish backstop to derail the Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal was achievable. Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            British prime minister Theresa May has so far shown little sign of moving away from her Chequers plan. Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is open to extending Britain’s Brexit transition period by another year, according to reports. Mr Barnier has said he is open to the possibility of a one-year extension to Britain’s Brexit transition in return for British prime minister heresa May accepting a “two-tier” backstop to avoid a border in Northern Ireland, according to EU diplomats.On the eve of a Brexit summit in Brussels on Wednesday night, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator told ministers from the 27 member states that Brussels was ready to propose fresh ideas to reach a deal by next month, the Financial Times said.The plan, informally suggested to the UK in talks last week, involves including a one-year extension clause for the 21-month transition period, which ends in December 2020. This would grant more time to agree a new UK-EU trade relationship and avoid special arrangements for Northern Ireland. Britain, however, objected to significant elements of the plan for Northern Ireland, effectively suspending talks until after the summit of EU leaders this week.According to the Financial Times, Mr Barnier told EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg of his vision for a “two tier” backstop that could be included in the withdrawal agreement to ensure an open border was always maintained between Northern Ireland and the State.\u0026nbspThis would include both a backstop for Northern Ireland alone, keeping it within the EU customs union and single market for goods, and alternative references to a UK-wide customs union.Any separate UK-EU customs arrangements would, however, have to take the form of a new treaty to be negotiated and agreed in full after Brexit. “The extension and two-tier backstop arrangement would only be offered if all other parts of the Withdrawal Agreement are reached,” said one official in the room.The FT quoted another diplomat, who said: “The extension is an example of how we could be flexible to help the British side if they want it.”\u0026nbspMr Barnier’s comments come as Mrs May prepares to address leaders of the EU27 on Wednesday evening in Brussels. She will then leave them to discuss the next steps on Brexit over dinner in her absence.Mr Barnier said the Brexit process must be “orderly for everyone and in all subjects – including Ireland”.Meanwhile, Germany’s Europe minister Michael Roth has urged Ms May to “take responsibility” for Brexit.“The situation is very serious . . . All involved must now look into whether the compromises made have been sufficient. For us, it is clear, we want a fair deal with the GB. But it must be a deal that preserves the integrity of the single market,” he said.Mr Roth said his message to Mrs May is, “take responsibility and be constructive”.While the UK was demanding “flexibility” from Brussels, the EU was limited in its room for manoeuvre because of the need to keep the Irish Border open, he said.“We can have either a smooth Brexit or rocky one,” said France’s EU affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau. “We all prefer a smooth one but we have to stand ready if there is no deal.”EU leaders have scrapped plans to discuss and publish a draft declaration this week on the bloc’s future trade deal with the UK after the derailment of the talks over the Border, in a blow to Ms May. An outline of an agreement was due to be “on the table” at a summit dinner of leaders on Wednesday night. When Brexit secretary Dominic Raab refused to sign off on an agreement on the Border have carefully choreographed plans came to a halt.Mrs May briefed her senior ministers in an extended session of cabinet ahead of Wednesday’s crunch meeting.There was strong support from cabinet ministers for Mrs May’s insistence that any Brexit deal must maintain the integrity of the union and cannot keep the UK indefinitely in a backstop customs arrangement, said Mrs May’s spokesman.Mr Barnier said he hopes a deal with Britain is possible “in the coming weeks”.With no likelihood of a deal this week, a special Brexit summit is expected to be scheduled for November. But it remains unclear whether this will be framed as a final opportunity to reach agreement or as a chance for the 27 to make preparations for a disorderly no-deal withdrawal.The prime minister told the House of Commons on Monday that an exit agreement is still “achievable”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said because the UK is “determined to leave the customs union and the single market, because the UK says it wants bilateral trade deals” the Government must insist on the backstop.This is “to protect the island of Ireland and the two jurisdictions on it, ensuring . . . normality between communities trading with each other, that that isn’t undermined as an unintended consequence of Brexit,” he said.Speaking ahead of a private meeting on Tuesday in Luxembourg with Mr Barnier, the Tánaiste said he is confident that the Barnier taskforce, and Mr Barnier himself, “will deliver a deal that is consistent with what’s already been committed to in these negotiations, which is not an unreasonable ask”.Mr Coveney is meeting with Mr Barnier to discuss the current state of play in negotiations. And in particular talks on the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop on avoiding a hard border.“Our bottom line on this is that we must have a backstop in the withdrawal treaty,” said Mr Coveney. “That backstop cannot be time limited in terms of an end date. It needs to be there unless and until something better is negotiated and agreed.” – Additional reporting agencies.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

While on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves make more than eight times more than the have-nots. Photograph: GettyBulgarians and visitors to their capital Sofia were offered a dazzling show of ancient and modern wealth earlier this year. The country’s national gallery, housed in an elegant former royal palace, displayed 62 glittering treasures dating back to 1,000BC in an exhibition called “The Golden Fleece. The Quest of the Argonauts”.It included 16 pieces that were on show for the first time, having resided in the well-guarded storehouses of the Thrace Foundation, a creation of multi-millionaire businessman Vassil Bojkov. The exhibition brought some cultural sparkle to Bulgaria’s six-month presidency of the EU, and may also have added a little lustre to Bojkov’s shadowy reputation.Established in 2004, the Thrace Foundation says it funds research and improves access to museums and protection of cultural heritage while caring for its founder’s collection of more than 3,000 precious artefacts.Bojkov, whose name is sometimes spelled Vasil Bozhkov, is thought to be Bulgaria’s richest man, with an empire ning construction to gambling operations that he built during his nation’s chaotic and sometimes bloody switch from communism to capitalism in the 1990s. With the Thrace Foundation perhaps the tycoon nicknamed “The Skull” is trying to give something back to the poorest and most unequal country in the EU.Some 11 years after Bulgaria joined the EU – raising hopes for a swift rise in prosperity, a more robust democracy and broader social justice – data from Eurostat in Brussels now make for bleak reading.Bulgaria has the lowest average salary in the EU (€575), the lowest minimum wage (€260) and the smallest average pension (€190).The upshot is that more than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are now at risk of poverty and social exclusion – twice the proportion of Germans who find themselves in the same predicament.In addition, while on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves\u0026nbspmake more than eight times more than the have-nots – without accounting for undeclared wealth.“There are three Bulgarian realities,” says Daniel Kaddik, the Sofia-based director of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in southeast Europe.“People with an average salary don’t live a good life here, with prices for food, energy and other things that are comparable with elsewhere in Europe.”“Then there is a relatively small middle class who have their own bubble, and work in start-ups or international companies, and live in some areas of Sofia that are comparable with parts of Berlin, for example.”“Then there’s the upper class, which is detached from everything else. They have very fancy cars and private members’ clubs, and there is very often an overlap with shady business.”“I lived in Berlin and I never saw a Maybach,” he adds. “In Sofia I’ve already seen three.”The economy is growing at around 3.5 per cent, but the World Bank says it needs to expand “by at least 4 per cent per year over the next 25 years for Bulgaria to catch up with average EU income levels and thus boost shared prosperity”.Bulgaria leads the EU when it comes to one unpalatable indicator – the prevalence of corruption, and graft is draining the economy, scaring away foreign investors and serving to keep people poor.The country was the EU’s most corrupt nation in the latest Transparency International index, ranking in 71st place alongside South Africa and Vanuatu.Just as alarmingly, an EU survey found last year that only one-quarter of Bulgarians would trust the police to deal with a corruption complaint, and police and customs officers are seen as the public servants most likely to take bribes.The European Parliament estimates that corruption costs Bulgaria about 15 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and graft reaches into every facet of life – from rigged tenders, opaque contracts and kickbacks in multimillion-euro deals to the need for ordinary citizens to pay bribes to smooth their path through the country’s health and education systems and its Byzantine bureaucracy.All these backhanders, big and small, feed a grey economy in Bulgaria that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found last year was equivalent to 29.6 per cent of its GDP, the largest such share in the EU.The result is a debilitating cycle of tax evasion and capital flight, depleted revenues for the government, sub-standard services for the public, and a grinding sense of injustice, grievance and mistrust towards officials and state institutions.An EU survey last year found that when it came to achieving success in life, more than twice as many Bulgarians believe that “knowing the right people” is a bigger factor than having a good education.This feeling that the game is rigged in favour of those with connections, and that poverty is permanent, is writ large in Bulgarian demographics - young people are leaving, couples are having fewer children and the population is falling fast.The UN says Bulgaria is actually the world’s fastest shrinking nation, with its current population of about 7 million people expected to dwindle to 5.4 million by 2050 and 3.9 million by the end of the century.Bulgaria has already lost almost 2 million people from a peak of nearly 9 million in 1989, revealing the massive and long-term impact of the transition from communism to capitalism on eastern Europe - where eight other countries are also expected to suffer a population decline of more than 15 per cent by 2050.The EU’s highest mortality rate, coupled with one of the bloc’s lowest birth rate and the emigration of tens of thousands of workers each year, leave Bulgaria with a headache over how to fund pensions and healthcare for an ageing population.It is no surprise that tens of thousands of Bulgarians seek jobs abroad each year, with Germany, Britain and Spain their favoured destinations, creating a chronic shortage of staff in country’s health service, schools and other major sectors.“There are now places where you don’t have doctor within radius of 50km. You have to bring own toilet paper to the hospital and these kinds of things. It’s a climate that lots of people just don’t want to live in anymore,” says Kaddik.While young professionals are leaving home in search of higher wages, better working conditions and a less corrupt environment, many Bulgarians do not even wait until graduation to start looking abroad for opportunities.About 17 per cent of Bulgarian students went to a foreign university last year, and some of the country’s top universities are now trying to fill hundreds of empty places for the new term.A glimmer of good news for people returning from abroad is that they will probably find the family home waiting. About 84 per cent of Bulgarians own the place where they live, compared to just 53 per cent in Germany.“People were given the apartments where they were living (when communism collapsed) and they are lucky to own their homes, otherwise they simply could not afford their housing,” says Kaddik.“A lot of Bulgarians, especially the elderly, rely on food grown on a little family plot outside the city. The family bond is strong here, and among friends and relatives there is a lot of exchange of small services and helping each other out – but it’s out of necessity because of a lack of good services.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Republican Sentaor Lindsey Graham rails against \u0026lsquorogue prince\u0026rsquo Mohammed bin SalmanSaudi Arabia denies leaks that Khashoggi was killed at the consulateLabor Party, the Greens and crossbenchers combine to vote down the statementUS president takes phone call from King Salman and appears to accept Saudi denialsUS will inflict \u0026lsquosevere punishment\u0026rsquo if the kingdom is found to be responsibleNot even royals are exempt from being \u0026lsquodisappeared\u0026rsquo by despotic Wahhabist regimeInvestigators tell US counterparts recordings prove journalist was killed in Saudi embassyBritain seeking \u0026lsquourgent answers\u0026rsquo following disappearance of Jamal KhashoggiDate set by Russia and Turkey aiming to impose lasting ceasefire in Syrian provinceOfficials believe the missing Jamal Khashoggi was killed in the consulateJamal Khashoggi has not been seen since entering Istanbul building several days agoNuzha secondary school in Jordan faced closure due to US withdrawal of $300m fundsUnrwa will have to launch a supreme effort to make up for the lack of US fundsUS president puts pressure on King Salman over rising oil pricesFormer beauty queen Tara al-Fares was shot while sitting in car in BaghdadStrike took place at 2am and targeted bases of \u0026lsquotakfiri terrorists\u0026rsquo backed by AmericaBoys were hit by sniper fire near perimeter fence surrounding Gaza as protests escalateMahmoud Abbas tells assembly Trump has reneged on all previous US commitmentsMoscow and Ankara seek demilitarised buffer zone in Syrian province to avert disasterMoscow says it will supply advanced S-300 system after one of its planes was downed"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3665848.1539716385!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may calls for government unity ahead of eu summit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British prime minister Theresa May: The cabinet expressed support for her  approach ahead of Wednesday’s summit in Brussels. Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May has called for unity within her government ahead of an EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday, telling ministers that she can still achieve a good deal on Brexit. Ms May told her cabinet that she would never support a deal that creates a customs border in the Irish Sea or leaves Britain trapped indefinitely in a backstop arrangement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe said that, despite the failure of negotiators to reach agreement on the backstop ahead of the summit, there had been significant progress.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“If we as a government stand together and stand firm, we can achieve this,” she said.The prime minister’s official spokesman said that all ministers contributed to a discussion on Brexit which took up two thirds of the 2½ hour meeting. He said they agreed that Britain cannot be kept in the backstop indefinitely and discussed “the need for a mechanism to clearly define how that backstop will end”.Ireland’s Ambassador to London Adrian O’Neill has expressed concerns about British “backsliding” over the Northern Ireland backstop by demanding that it should be time-limited. Mr O’Neill said Britain had agreed last December and again in March that there should be a backstop that would operate unless and until a permanent solution was found to keep the Border open.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“There seems to be some degree of backsliding on those insofar as this demand for a time-limited version of the backstop is not consistent with what was agreed in December and March. We are concerned by that. A backstop that has a time limit on it ceases to be a backstop,” he said.Downing Street said the prime minister does not resile from any commitments she made in December or March but pointed out that when Britain proposed its UK-wide customs backstop last June, it said it should be time-limited.Although the prime minister told MPs on Monday that the backstop should be temporary, she declined to say if it should have a specific end date. Her official spokesman said on Tuesday that a mechanism to determine how the backstop should end would have the same effect as making it time-limited.Eight cabinet ministers met for pizza on Monday evening in the office of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom in what was perceived in advance as a Brexiteer caucus plotting tactics ahead of the cabinet meeting. Former Brexit secretary David Davis called on Sunday for Brexiteer ministers to rise up against Mrs May’s Brexit strategy but no ministers threatened to resign on Tuesday and the cabinet expressed support for the prime minister’s approach ahead of Wednesday’s summit in Brussels.\u0026nbsp“The cabinet strongly supported the prime minister on the importance of maintaining the integrity of the union,” the spokesman said.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds warned ahead of the cabinet meeting that if his party is unhappy with the backstop, it could disrupt the government’s business without triggering a general election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act there are a lot of things that we can not support in terms of the government’s domestic and financial and welfare agenda which does not trigger the possibility of Jeremy Corbyn coming into No 10,” he told the BBC.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Reuters Frank AugsteinAs Theresa May prepares to address EU leaders before dinner at Wednesday’s summit in Brussels, both sides are determined that there should be no repeat of the rancorous displays at Salzburg last month. Michel Barnier said on Tuesday that the Brexit negotiations needed more time while May told her cabinet that negotiators had made significant progress and that a deal was achievable.Still unresolved, however, is the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop, which Donald Tusk on Tuesday compared to the Gordian Knot unravelled by Alexander the Great.“It looks like a new version of the Gordian Knot,” Tusk said. “Unfortunately, I can’t see a new version of Alexander the Great. It’s not so easy to find this kind of creative leader.”Britain wants a customs backstop covering the whole of the UK to be included in the legally binding withdrawal agreement and it wants that backstop to be time-limited. The EU says a time limit would rob the backstop of its effectiveness as an insurance policy, and insists that customs arrangements for the whole of the UK are part of the future relationship outlined in a non-binding political declaration.Britain argues that, if the EU can make an exception for Northern Ireland by allowing its customs relationship with the EU to be in the withdrawal agreement, it can do the same for the rest of the UK. The EU’s response is that, under article 50, the withdrawal agreement can cover issues concerned only with Britain’s orderly withdrawal from the EU.The threat of violence and political disorder in Northern Ireland would threaten that orderly withdrawal. But the withdrawal agreement also covers such issues as geographical indicators for food products such as Parma ham and champagne.Although Britain continues to insist that the backstop should be time-limited, the cabinet on Tuesday discussed a “mechanism” that would bring it to an end. This suggests that London could accept some kind of escape clause which gives neither side a veto on ending the backstop but sets out a series of steps that should bring it to an end.The Gordian Knot was a labyrinthine tangle remarkable for its complexity and for the fact that it left no loose ends visible, which Alexander simply sliced through with his sword – an option that is not available where the backstop is concerned.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It’s a simple process that helps retailers meet the requirements of regulators worldwide.”  Yoti declined to say which supermarkets will use the technology initially, but said its software will been seen with major retailers very soon. Tesco, Morrisons and Asda did not comment before time of publishing. The system does not require shoppers to register their identity in advance and does not retain any visual information about users after they have made a purchase.The tills are currently used by many UK retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Boots, and WHSmith.Regular customers will also be able to speed up the process by using a smartphone app to prove their age at the till. The app, also made by Yoti, does however require a customer to register their ID document and face with the company beforehand. Yoti previously told The Daily  that two of the big four supermarkets, which are Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda, will be piloting its technology this year, although the company could not disclose which ones. However, a Sainsbury’s spokesperson said it was not going to be trialing the software, leaving Tesco, Morrisons and Asda as the likely candidates to use the technology. Tesco’s have previously used face-scanning cameras at tills in petrol stations to target advertisements at customers depending on their age and approximate age, which was made by Lord Alan Sugar\u0027s company Amscreen.NCR’s new facial recognition technology aims to cut down the length of queues, because age verification can make up for more than half of interventions by staff at at self-checkouts, according to its company’s research.NCR, who are based in Atlanta, Georgia, will also being introducing the camera technology with retailers in the US.Theresa May expected to reject Seoul’s request to relax sanctions on North KoreaMy Dinner with Hervé: Peter Dinklage on the true story behind a Hollywood tragedyComment: Contactless may be quicker, but life is richer when we use real moneyComment: It\u0026#39s \u0026#39deal or disaster\u0026#39 time for Mrs May, but purist Brexiteers won\u0026#39t get what they want either wayDuchess of Sussex \u0026#39running on adrenaline\u0026#39 as busy Australia tour takes its tollRomance scam victims lose £5,000 in more than a third of casesPrince Charles to be guest editor of Country Life - and commissions Camilla to write for the magazineChildren\u0026#39s Commissioner: 50,000 babies and toddlers living in \u0026#39toxic trio\u0026#39 households of domestic violence, substance abuse and mental ill-healthHundreds of children abused or harmed by charity workers, watchdog revealsOwners of aggressive dogs should take speed-awareness style courses to make them take more responsibilitySchools that kick out unruly pupils to boost league table position face crack down, Education Secretary warnsEvery hour kids spend online increases chance of buying junk food by a fifthDonald Trump likens condemnation of Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi affair to criticism of Brett KavanaughThere She Goes, episode 1 review: this sucker-punching sitcom nails the experience of raising a child with learning disabilitiesGive workers standing desks and make them get to their feet in meetings, Health Secretary urges  Booker prize awarded to \u0026#39challenging\u0026#39 novel, as judges recommend waiting for the audiobookOnline live streaming a \u0026#39magnet for paedophiles\u0026#39, police and NSPCC warnFalling asleep in university lectures could be treated as sign of a mental disorderWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000177458172_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1TJOa7BZ2Re4vzncv8bVr5IJUf7Hyxq67IAaSz0vTU0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"khashoggi case troubling must not burn bridges saudi allies","story":"People protest outside the Embassy of Saudi ArabiaHad events taken a different course, the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi would be in Washington this week, appearing as guest speaker at a high-profile conference on the future of the Middle East.

She navigated complex identities and has so much resonance in the world we live in today.”A Muslim Sufi pacifist, who began her career as a children’s writer living in Paris with her family, Ms Inayat Khan was perhaps an unlikely candidate to spy for Britain against the Nazis.However, after escaping to Britain following the fall of France, she trained for the Women’s Auxiliary Airforce and was later recruited as a secret agent for the Special Operations Executive (SOE). She became the first female radio operator sent into Nazi-occupied France in 1943 - aged just 29.A statue of Noor Inayat Khan, a British spy captured and killed by the Nazis during World War II, is unveiled by Princess Anne in central London in 2012The spy, born to an American mother and a father of Indian royal descent, ran the Prosper network of resistance communications in Paris, which was commissioned by Winston Churchill to set Europe ablaze.She was shot and killed by the SS at Dachau concentration camp after being betrayed by a French woman and suffering 10 months of starvation and torture at the hands of the Gestapo. For her bravery, Ms Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross in 1949.Baroness Warsi told The : “Often what\u0027s been spoken about is the forgotten heroes of the First and Second World Wars, many people from around the world who served in the British Army including the British Indian Army, as both my grandfathers did.“In Britain which seems to be fractured along the lines of racial differences, here is someone who symbolises everything great about Britain - a young Muslim woman who gave up her life for her country. What could be better than putting a woman of colour who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our nation, who gave up her life for our nation, on the £50 note?“I am often asked \u0027are you Muslim first or British first\u0027 - and I say there is no conflict - she was a great example of someone who was very patriotic and also identified as Muslim. She is an example of how those identities can come together.”Some have likened the spy to a “female 007”, with Tom Tugendhat MP adding that “a national hero who reflects what we value most should be on the new £50, Noor Inayat Khan GC does that.She was murdered in Dachau concentration camp and posthumously awarded the George Cross for her extraordinary courage fighting evil.She must be pretty unusual if not absolutely unique - it\u0027s nothing to do with her race, religion or sex - this is a woman who had everything, who came from a life of great privilege.Her heritage would have made it very easy for her not to step up to the call of duty. She could have lived a very comfortable life, but put everything on the line before being murdered in Dachau.”BBC Presenter Dan Snow told The  “She was the first radio operator dropped into occupied France during World War Two. She was captured by the Gestapo. She escaped. Was recaptured. Then she was tortured and never gave anyone up.“She is a hero for our times.”The Bank of England said it was not limiting its pool of potential historical figures to women or people of colour, and added that it was up to the public to nominate suitable people.Other contenders put forward for the note include Margaret Thatcher and Clement Attlee.Bank of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyTheresa May expected to reject Seoul’s request to relax sanctions on North KoreaMy Dinner with Hervé: Peter Dinklage on the true story behind a Hollywood tragedyComment: Contactless may be quicker, but life is richer when we use real moneyComment: It\u0026#39s \u0026#39deal or disaster\u0026#39 time for Mrs May, but purist Brexiteers won\u0026#39t get what they want either wayDuchess of Sussex \u0026#39running on adrenaline\u0026#39 as busy Australia tour takes its tollRomance scam victims lose £5,000 in more than a third of casesPrince Charles to be guest editor of Country Life -

pulled out Google, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered have all pulled out of a technology and business conference in Saudi Arabia as pressure mounts on the Gulf kingdom to explain the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Billed as “Davos in the Desert”, the lavish Future Investment Initiative (FII) summit is meant to showcase Saudi Arabia’s modernising drive under Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman.\u0026nbspBut the build-up has been calamitous for the de facto Saudi ruler as a string of big-name sponsors, speakers and partners have dropped out after Mr Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October and never re-emerged.Mike Pompeo visits Saudi Arabia to discuss Jamal Khashoggi caseJust days ago, the attendee\u0027s list read like a who’s

from a dependence on oil towards a more broad-based, high-tech economy.Alongside sweeping economic reforms, the Crown Prince, often referred to by his initials MBS, has been keen to trumpet a liberalisation of social values in the conservative kingdom.\u0026nbspBut the withdrawal of vast dozens of the world’s leading media outlets\u0026nbspand companies from the high-profile event suggests that his Saudi rebrand has already been badly, perhaps fatally, damaged by events in Istanbul.Allegations that senior Saudi officials ordered the murder of a journalist and prominent critic will, if proved correct, pile further pressure on firms to distance themselves from the country and its billions.Dozens of Turkish and Saudi officials entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Monday to begin a joint investigation into the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi.That came after claims that the Saudis may be ready to admit the dissident journalist was killed during an interrogation that went wrong.CNN cited an unnamed source as saying the Saudis would claim the operation was carried out “without clearance or transparency” and that those involved would be punished – although another source cautioned that Riyadh could change its version of events.Hours before the 60-year-old’s scheduled consular visit, 15 Saudis – some of whom were later identified as security officials – arrived in Istanbul, leaving the country shortly after he disappeared, according to information published by Turkish media close to the government.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

intended to showcase modernisation of Gulf kingdomClick to followThe IndependentThe build-up has been calamitous for de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman as a host of big names have pulled out Google, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered have all pulled out of a technology and business conference in Saudi Arabia as pressure mounts on the Gulf kingdom to explain the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Billed as “Davos in the Desert”, the lavish Future Investment Initiative (FII) summit is meant to showcase Saudi Arabia’s modernising drive under Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman.\u0026nbspBut the build-up has been calamitous for the de facto Saudi ruler as a string of big-name sponsors, speakers and partners have dropped out after Mr Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October and never re-emerged.Mike Pompeo visits Saudi Arabia to discuss Jamal Khashoggi caseJust days ago, the attendee\u0027s list read like a who’s who of the corporate, media and technology worlds but on Monday the boss of Google’s cloud services business, Diane Greene, became the latest name\u0026nbspto be crossed out.\u0026nbspWhen the curtain is pulled up next week\u0026nbspthe conference will\u0026nbsplikely\u0026nbspbe somewhat more sparsely populated than Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince would have hoped.There will be no John Flint from HSBC, nor Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse or Bill Winters of Standard Chartered all three all pulled out on Tuesday.JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon said on Monday he would no longer attend while BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, Ford chairman Bill Ford and Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi are among others to have already pulled out as international pressure mounted on the Saudi regime.Disappearance of Saudi journalist exposes Trump\u0027s lack of ambassadorsRichard Branson pulls out of $1bn Saudi talks over missing journalistTurkey says it has audio and video proof Jamal Khashoggi was killedLindsey Graham says he\u0027s \u0027disturbed\u0027 by Jamal Khashoggi disappearanceSaudi Arabia\u0027s weakness is showing after a week of bad publicityThe PII is supposed to demonstrate Riyadh’s move away from a dependence on oil towards a more broad-based, high-tech economy.Alongside sweeping economic reforms, the Crown Prince, often referred to by his initials MBS, has been keen to trumpet a liberalisation of social values in the conservative kingdom.\u0026nbspBut the withdrawal of vast dozens of the world’s leading media outlets\u0026nbspand companies from the high-profile event suggests that his Saudi rebrand has already been badly, perhaps fatally, damaged by events in Istanbul.Allegations that senior Saudi officials ordered the murder of a journalist and prominent critic will, if proved correct, pile further pressure on firms to distance themselves from the country and its billions.Dozens of Turkish and Saudi officials entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Monday to begin a joint investigation into the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi.That came after claims that the Saudis may be ready to admit the dissident journalist was killed during an interrogation that went wrong.CNN cited an unnamed source as saying the Saudis would claim the operation was carried out “without clearance or transparency” and that those involved would be punished – although another source cautioned that Riyadh could change its version of events.Hours before the 60-year-old’s scheduled consular visit, 15 Saudis – some of whom were later identified as security officials – arrived in Istanbul, leaving the country shortly after he disappeared, according to information published by Turkish media close to the government.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

Huawei\u0027s timetable sees two main releases a year, with the bigger-screen Mate Series taking the autumn slot. So, what\u0027s new?Quite a lot actually, and while some manufacturers seem to offer incremental upgrades every six or 12 months, the Mate 20 Pro is stuffed to the gills with innovation, including a super-cool reverse wireless charging feature. But I\u0027m getting ahead of myself.The new phone is clearly related to the industrial design of the P20 Pro but has a significantly more elegant finish. Every corner and surface is gently curved, making for a phone that is far from small but still manages to fit the hand very comfortably.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

But to the flat of your finger it feels entirely smooth.Huawei says this should make the phone grippier and less prone to fingerprints and calls it a \u0027hyperoptical\u0027 pattern.The glass has been treated to have a shimmering, colour-changing effect depending on how you hold it. Most attractive of these is midnight blue which looks classy and businesslike without being dull. Emerald green has a similar shimmer and there\u0027s also pink gold and twilight black.The screen stretches almost to the bottom of the phone. It\u0027s not quite to the base but unlike the P20 Pro, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor at the base of the phone, which we\u0027ll come back to in a moment.There is a notch at the top of the display, with front-facing camera for facial recognition and, inevitably, for selfies.The rear of the phone is dominated by a three-camera set-up, like the P20 Pro. But, here, Huawei has placed the three cameras and flash in a square arrangement which is strikingly different from rivals. And the company has gone to a lot of trouble with the design here, too. The square in which the cameras sit is edged with four rounded corners which perfectly match the curved corners of the phone itself.The camera square is the only detail on the back of the phone, apart from the company name down towards the bottom. It means there\u0027s a spare, strong look to the design.And this phone is waterproof to a level of IP68, which means it can sit in 2 metres of water for half an hour safely.So, you\u0027ll have noticed there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor on the rear of the phone, nor at the base of the display. You can unlock the handset with facial recognition, which works reasonably quickly.But there\u0027s a much cooler way to do it.The Mate 20 Pro has a fingerprint sensor built right into the display, buried in the middle of the screen. When you lift the phone, the lock screen has a fingerprint icon which shows you where to press. Not only does it work well and very quickly, it\u0027s amazingly satisfying to use.Huawei has put this technology into a phone before, and rumours suggest other handsets will have it, and soon, but in any event, it\u0027s a great feature that could almost be enough to tempt you on its own.Which brings us to the coolest feature of all, and a genuine full-on innovation. This phone is capable of wireless charging, as many others are. A charging coil in the back of the phone receives the power from a wireless charging pad.But Huawei has somehow managed to create a phone which can give as well as take. If your phone is capable of wireless charging and you are running out of battery power, well, I can help. By pressing your phone against the back of mine, the Huawei charges your handset. A haptic buzz confirms the connection and it feels little short of magic.Because Qi wireless charging is an open standard, you\u0027re not restricted to other Huawei Mate 20s, when it comes to sharing your battery. I\u0027ve tested this against an iPhone XS Max and it works perfectly.Sure, it\u0027s not as fast as a plugged-in charger, but it\u0027s pretty amazing. It requires a flick of a setting to turn it on, and if you don\u0027t charge it, the feature switches off after three minutes.At best, this will lead to a future full of generous battery sharing and at worst, well, there must be a cheesy chat-up line or two to be had out of all this, no?The phone will charge fast through regular wireless charging, Huawei says, and very fast through a wired charge – the company says it will go from flat to 70 per cent in 30 minutes, an increase over the P20 Pro which would reach 58 per cent in the same time.The battery is big, by the way, clocking in at 4200mAh, so it should run a full day with ease.The Mate 20 Pro boasts a 7nm processor (nm means nanometre). This is quite an achievement. Apple has a 7nm processor in its latest phones but, Huawei points out, it was the first to announce it, even if the phone is coming to market a little later.The benefits of a 7nm processor? Well, it promises to be faster and more power-efficient.This was what set the P20 Pro apart from pretty much every other cameraphone. Leica\u0027s involvement was crucial to this. It included a sensor with a whopping 40MP resolution, a black-and-white sensor to grab detail quickly even in low light and a separate 8MP sensor which effectively offered 3x optical zoom.This time, the monochrome sensor has been replaced by an ultra-wide-angle 20MP colour one. Huawei says the sensors are now so fast, there\u0027s no need for the monochrome, though I suspect it means that if you want to shoot in black-and-white, you\u0027ll get images which are decent rather than, as before, outstanding. Mind you, black-and-white isn\u0027t a priority for most people.The 8MP sensor remains at a focal length which gives an effective 3x optical zoom and the Ultra-wide is a 20MP camera which is 0.6x the zoom of the wide-angle lens. This lens is also exceptional for close-up shots, Huawei says, allowing you to get as close as 2.5cm from your subject.All these make for a potentially very powerful camera, and that\u0027s before we\u0027ve talked about AI.Huawei Mate 10: An AI phone designed to think like a humanHuawei uses artificial intelligence heavily in its cameras, using scene settings to improve the photographic results. So, if it\u0027s a dog you’re photographing, it fluffs up Fido\u0027s fur, but if it\u0027s a cat, Tibbles\u0027 eyes will be enhanced.This use of AI should mean you can trust to the automatic settings of the camera and concentrate on capturing the moment and framing your shot.The front-facing camera is a 24MP model capable of wider selfies than some, so you can all squeeze in.There\u0027s a lot to like in the Mate 20 Pro, from the snazzy cameras to attention-grabbing features like the in-screen fingerprint sensor and the brilliant reverse wireless charging.Huawei\u0027s special version of Android software hasn\u0027t always met with positive reaction, though this version certainly looks better, and it remains to be seen how effective the AI turns out to be, beyond improving the photos, but there\u0027s no doubt this is an imaginative and innovative handset. The phone is out soon and costs £899.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Twitter and Google have taken the same approach as Apple and added some kind of filling to their bagels, for instance, but have kept them closed Microsoft and Samsung\u0027s bagels are both plain, but they are cut open like Apple\u0027s one.Emoji that vary can cause genuine problems when people use them for communication. A 2016 study found a significant discrepancy in what the different emoji seem to communicate, and warned that it could lead to serious confusion when people send them across various platforms.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.

Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.“It’s not a light read,” he said. “It’s challenging in the way a walk up Snowden is challenging it’s definitely worth it when you get to the summit.”\u0026nbspBurns’s victory was announced at London’s Guildhall, where she was presented with a trophy by Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall, and £50,000 prize money by Man Group chief executive\u0026nbspLuke Ellis. She also receives a specially designed version of her book and a further £2,500 for being shortlisted. The other shortlisted contestants also get £2,500 each.I\u0027d like to acknowledge all the great writers on the shortlist and longlist with me, the visibly emotional Burns told the audience.\u0026nbspTo all my dear friends, thank you. I think I\u0027d better stop. Thanks.Burns managed to beat stiff competition from\u0026nbspRichard Powers‘\u0026nbspThe Overstory, described as the “eco-epic\u0026nbspof the year​” and the bookies’ favourite, as well as the youngest ever nominee for the award, the 27-year-old Daisy Johnson, who was nominated for\u0026nbspEverything Under,\u0026nbspa book that details the struggles of a young woman who was abandoned by her mother at the age of 16.Other\u0026nbspshortlisted nominees included\u0026nbspRobin Robertson\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspThe Long Take, which centres on\u0026nbspa D-Day veteran living with post-traumatic stress disorder\u0026nbspRachel Kushner‘s\u0026nbspThe Mars Room, a\u0026nbspgritty story about a former lap-dancer serving two life sentences in a\u0026nbspwomen’s jail and\u0026nbspWashington Black by\u0026nbspEsi Edugyan, which focusses on a\u0026nbspyoung man who breaks free from the chains of slavery.\u0026nbspEdugyan was the only author to have previously appeared on the shortlist, for her\u0026nbsp2011 book\u0026nbspHalf-Blood Blues\u0026nbsp.British Booker prize novel sparks free speech row in Czech RepublicWriting for\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspabout the winning novel,\u0026nbspDaisy Buchanan noted that Milkman is “upsettingly, structurally strange, but blackly and undeniably funny,” saying that\u0026nbsp“Burns deftly immerses the reader in an adolescent world by minimising great pains and making what is seemingly small feel enormous”.Burns can expect to receive\u0026nbspinternational recognition for winning the Booker prize. Last year’s winner\u0026nbspGeorge Saunders saw sales of his\u0026nbspnovel Lincoln in the Bardo\u0026nbspincrease\u0026nbsp1227 per cent following the victory.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You may have seen a black laptop before, he says, with a disconcerting sincerity, but you\u0027ve never seen a black laptop like this before.Lifting the lid of the computer, he invites\u0026nbspme to touch it. Go ahead, he says. Stroke it. I do as I\u0027m\u0026nbsptold and run my fingers along the soft\u0026nbspsurface of the palm rest. That\u0027s Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth, he continues. Usually you\u0027d find it in luxury cars. It\u0027s absolutely stunning.Sure enough, it feels\u0026nbspmore suited to being something you\u0027d sit on than cover an electronic device\u0026nbspwith, and even the smell is more like a new car than a laptop. Researching it later I learnt Alcantara\u0026nbsphas been used in everything from Formula 1 race cars to space ships, and the fact Microsoft has decided to use it in its latest laptop is a supremely smooth statement of intent in a high-end hardware category typically dominated by Apple.Alcantara material on the palm rests is designed for \u0027maximised typing comfort\u0027 (The Independent)The man from Microsoft - Simon Lambert, devices category lead for Surface - takes 10 minutes just to talk me through the design decisions that went into creating the Surface Laptop 2. For starters, there are no visible screw on its exterior and no bumpers on the edge of the screen to protect it when you close it. (Why would you need them when you\u0027ve got Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth to cushion it?)For a high-performance laptop with an impressive 14.5-hour battery life, it is also absurdly thin. I\u0026nbspuse the smallest flagship smartphone on the market - the Sony Xperia\u0026nbspXZ1 - and at its thinnest point the Surface Laptop 2 is the same width: less than 1 cm thick. As it thickens out towards the base of the screen, it adds less than half a centimetre. Yet despite the slim\u0026nbspprofile, it feels incredibly sturdy and is able to offer a typing experience rarely found in the so-called Ultrabook category of laptops.The most obvious comparison in terms of size and design would be the now-ancient MacBook Air, but in terms of internal specs it would be more appropriate to put it up against this year\u0027s 13-inch MacBook Pro. It features the same 8GB\u0026nbspor 16GB\u0026nbspof RAM, together with an 8th-generation\u0026nbspIntel Core i5 or i7 -\u0026nbspdepending on the version you choose.Beyond specs, Microsoft is also able to put itself alongside both Apple and Google in combining their own hardware with their own software, meaning\u0026nbspthe Laptop 2 is built with Windows 10 in mind.The Surface Laptop 2 comes less than a year and a half after Microsoft unveiled the first Surface Laptop, which the Redmond-based firm described at the time as 50 per cent faster than the MacBook Pro. This time, Lambert tells me the Surface Laptop 2 is 85 per cent faster than its predecessor.Lambert explains that the attention to detail goes right down to the travel of the keys on the keyboard, which punch down 1.5mm - a full 1 mm more than the 13-inch MacBook Pro. For someone who types words for a living, this kind of thought is appreciated. With the Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth cushioning the heels of my hands, and the thick clunk of the keys making each letter from my fingertips feel purposeful, even writing these words for this review feels\u0026nbspgood.Backlit keys also help to improve the typing experience, but it is not just light that emanates\u0026nbspfrom the keyboard.\u0026nbspThe OmniSonic speakers mean sound plays straight out from between the keys, offering both a rich and loud sound that once again belies the delicate size of the Surface Laptop 2.The generous size of the palm rests means that there has inevitably been a compromise with the size of the trackpad. Moving the mouse around the screen felt cumbersome and took some getting used to - a burden that is addressed to some extent by the inclusion of a touchscreen. This proves particularly useful when flicking through Netflix or scrolling down webpages.If you\u0027re looking for further downsides, the other obvious one is the lack of ports. Beyond holes for a power cable\u0026nbspand a single USB drive, there is only a Mini Display Port, meaning anything else like an HDMI cable will require a dongle - proving that Microsoft is able to borrow both the bad and the good from Apple.But overall, the Surface Laptop 2 is a powerful combination of performance, design and battery life, that is able to fulfil even the most fawning of plaudits gushed by Lambert. With the best hardware combined with the best software, he tells me, with genuine adulation,\u0026nbspthis black laptop is the only black laptop that will let you do more, achieve more, and dream more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is a bright flash of radioactive\u0026nbspthat flings out huge quantities of important elements like silver, gold, platinum and uranium.The announcement comes after scientists announced last October that they had seen the first explosion of this kind. They spotted super dense stars smashing into each other 130 million light years away\u0026nbsp– wobbling the spacetime of the universe, and allowing them to be picked up by gravitational wave detectors at LIGO.At the time, that discovery was hailed as a new chapter in astrophysics and an unexpected discovery. It allowed scientists to understand the spectacular explosions of neutron stars, as well as answering questions about where gold comes from.Now, scientists have found what they think might be a related event, known as\u0026nbspGRB150101B – and one that suggests such spectacular explosions could be far more common than we had realised. The similarities between the two events have led researchers to suggest they might in fact be related.It\u0027s a big step to go from one detected object to two, said study lead author Eleonora Troja, a researcher at the University of Maryland and\u0026nbspNASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center. Our discovery tells us that events like GW170817 and GRB150101B could represent a whole new class of erupting objects that turn on and off – and might actually be relatively common.The two look very similar: both threw out a short gamma-ray burst and a flash of bright, blue optical light. They also seem to come from very similar galaxies. Together, that has led scientists to believe that they are related – and that therefore many more similar events might be happening throughout the universe.We have a case of cosmic lookalikes, said study co-author Geoffrey Ryan, a postdoctoral researcher in the UMD Department of Astronomy and a fellow of the Joint Space-Science Institute. They look the same, act the same and come from similar neighbourhoods, so the simplest explanation is that they are from the same family of objects.Scientists are able to learn less about the new collision\u0026nbspbecause, unlike in October, they did not pick up the gravitational wave that was thrown out by the explosion because the new one was so much further away. With that data, it is possible to work out the masses of the two objects that merged\u0026nbsp– but they hope to gather that kind of data\u0026nbspin the future.Surely it\u0027s only a matter of time before another event like GW170817 will provide both gravitational wave data and electromagnetic imagery. If the next such observation reveals a merger between a neutron star and a black hole, that would be truly groundbreaking, said study co-author Alexander Kutyrev, an associate research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy with a joint appointment at NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center. Our latest observations give us renewed hope that we\u0027ll see such an event before too long.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If such an event took place today it would likely disrupt much of the planet’s communication technology.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We do have the right to go over to Ireland, don\u0027t we?”Davidson hints she will quit if Northern Ireland given special terms Storm Callum: Thousands in Ireland without power as heavy winds hit ScTroubles probe should be dropped- ex-Northern Ireland secretariesHe added: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can\u0027t I?”The Irish Post said Mr Bridgen’s remarks displayed “astounding ignorance over Anglo-Irish relations and the border issue”.The terms of the 1999 Good Friday Agreement, which provides the basis for Northern Ireland’s devolved government, means anyone born in Northern Ireland is entitled to an Irish passport, which therefore confers EU citizenship because of the Republic’s membership of the EU.When BBC Radio Ulster host Stephen Nolan said to Mr Bridgen the Brexit negotiations had “nothing to do with your right as an English person to come over to Ireland”, the Conservative MP replied with another perplexing claim.He said: “We have a reciprocal agreement where I can go to Ireland and ask for an Irish passport, and someone from Ireland can come to the UK and ask for a British passport. We have that system. That\u0027s the system we have, isn\u0027t it?”There is no reciprocal system in place\u0026nbsp– Irish citizenship can be granted to British passport holders, but there are several criteria which must be met. Normally, a British citizen will obtain Irish citizenship through birth, descent or marriage.There is also no particular provision for Irish citizens who want to become British citizens. Irish citizens, in common with people living in the countries that make up the Commonwealth, would be required to apply for naturalisation as British citizens rather than registration after five years\u0027 residence in the UK.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

During her time there, she told The Independent of the restrictive and at times “inhumane” regime in the centre.The Botswanan national and her mother were informed last week by the Home Office that her latest immigration claim had been rejected. They are now pursuing an appeal over the decision.Woman who arrived in UK as a child reveals reality of UK deportationGovernment thwarted in new bid to deport woman brought to UK as childYarl\u0027s Wood: Inside the crisis-hit immigration detention centreWoman who arrived in UK as a child reveals reality of UK deportationSpeaking to The Independent on Tuesday, Ms Kgari said that although she sees herself as British, she feels unwanted\u0026nbspby the UK government.“I’ve been moulded into the woman I am today through the education system and the people who I hang out with all the time,” she said.“So for the government to then turn around and say you’re not British, you’re not part of our community, is a real blow.”The Home Office tried to remove Ms Kgari and her mother from the UK twice while they were in Yarl\u0027s Wood, but on both occasions the removal was thwarted following intervention from MPs and lawyers.Ms\u0026nbspKgari\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspwho, along with her mother, is now staying with a friend\u0026nbspin Stoke-on-Trent\u0026nbspand is still unable to work,\u0026nbspstudy or travel –\u0026nbspsaid the experience of detention and the removal attempts had affected her mental health.“I was made to feel like I’d done something so wrong –\u0026nbspto be\u0026nbspput in a restraint belt and into a van, separate from my mum, with six escorts around me. It’s ridiculous, really,” she said.“It was so hard, just not knowing what was happening. It was such a shock, and not knowing what would come next. The possibility of being deported to a place I have not been for such a long time.Woman who arrived in UK as a child reveals reality of UK deportation“After the injunction was put through I stayed in my room in Yarl\u0027s Wood for a few days. I didn’t speak to many people for a while.“Ms Kgari was first made aware that there was an issue with her status when she applied to university in 2010 and was rejected due to her immigration status.Without the right to work, she threw\u0026nbspherself into volunteering for charitable causes\u0026nbspuntil she and her mother were detained in Yarl\u0027s Wood last year.Now out of detention, but still with an unresolved immigration status, Ms Kgari said she was spending her time helping out with a crisis support organisation to “help make a difference to other people’s lives”.She said: “Getting the news that our claim had been refused last week was difficult, and knowing that with that there’s a chance I could get taken back to the detention centre and possibly worse. I’m living every day as though it’s my last.“I just hope that anyone who has seen or heard my story and is in a similar situation can rest assured that they are not alone. I hope my story will be able to help someone out there.”Asylum and ImmigrationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.“Tomorrow I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determine if a breakthrough is possible.”Unfortunately the report on the state of the negotiations that I got from Michel\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbsptoday, as well as yesterday’s debate in the House of Commons, gives me no grounds for optimismMr Tusk said European countries needed “to make sure that we are prepared in case an agreement is not possible or in case it is rejected” and said leaders would step up no-deal preparatory discussions tomorrow.The 27 EU leaders will not even consider a trade deal with Britain at the summit, following the collapse of the border talks this weekend.The shock revelation, confirmed by senior EU diplomats familiar with preparations for the meeting, shows the rising risk of a no-deal Brexit as Theresa May travels to the EU capital in a bid to save her project.\u0026nbspOver dinner on Wednesday night the heads of government will decide whether there is any point in holding a special Brexit summit in November or whether the horse has already bolted and they should step-up preparations for a no deal.But they will not be presented with any drafts of the “joint political declaration” on the future relationship – the outline of a possible trading relationship between the UK and EU. Brussels has long insisted a trade deal can only be considered once withdrawal issues like the Irish border are settled.“The agreement on the withdrawal agreement, the Irish backstop, would trigger the delivery of the outline of the joint political declaration. That outline was supposed to be drafted by the Commission and would form the basis of the discussion of the EU leaders tomorrow evening,” one senior EU diplomat said, speaking in Brussels ahead of the meeting.“Since there is no agreement on the withdrawal, including on the Irish backstop, there will not be an outline of the joint political declaration on the table on Wednesday evening. That’s the situation as it stands and it will not change before Wednesday.”The lack of discussion about the future relationship is a huge blow for the prime minister, who has said she needs detailed plans on trade to get any withdrawal agreement – including on the multi-billion pound orce bill – past MPs. Her Chequers proposals were rejected out of hand by EU leaders as unworkable last month in Salzburg, after months of hints by the European Commission that they would not fly.The diplomat added: “The truth is… we have clarity now, actually, more clarity than we had in Salzburg. What we have found out in the process leading to this meeting on Wednesday is that it is not going to be so easy to find a deal between the EU and the UK.”The prime minister will once again be barred from the main discussion of Brexit at the summit, and will have to address the 27 leaders ahead of their dinner in a separate room.Ms May will also have to share her platform with\u0026nbspAntonio Tajani, the European Parliament president, who has been given the opportunity to put the body’s views to leaders ahead of their decision. Officials familiar with preparations said it was likely that Mr Tajani would be allowed to speak before the prime minister.The 27 other leaders will then go into their dinner, where they will hear chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s recommendation and draw their “moment of truth” conclusions.\u0026nbspThe prime minister will have to find her own dinner. One EU source confirmed there would be “no food on the table” at the meeting with Ms May, and that the meeting afterwards would take the format of a dinner because it “will take place at the time when normally people have dinners”.One EU diplomat was confident that the 27 national leaders would be unlikely to overrule Mr Barnier.“They meet primarily to decide on the further steps in the Brexit negotiations on the basis of our report of our negotiator Michel Barnier,” the diplomat said.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It is universally acknowledged that British music is one of this country’s biggest success stories, with UK artists releasing a staggering one\u0026nbspin 8 albums bought anywhere in the world.For musicians – the protestors include Jarvis Cocker and members of The Chemical Brothers, Super Furry Animals, Mogwai and Pink Floyd, among others – “being in the EU” has played a major part.They point out that no less than 60 per cent of revenues paid to the UK come from the EU, fuelled by a free sharing of data which is now under threat, and that the astonishing vinyl revival is at risk from higher import fees.But, for musicians, it’s much bigger than that. Music is and must be “about embracing and respecting other cultures”, they say – while Brexit will, inevitably, see Britain “isolate ourselves”.“Our concern is that new musicians won’t have the privileges that we had,” says Mr Singh, whose catchy number-one single “Brimful of Asha” was a key soundtrack of the\u0026nbsplate 1990s.Older musicians have grim memories of needing special permission to “get into countries when there wasn’t free movement, but that was a long time ago”, he says.He explains: “Britain is used as a base for touring France and Germany, but artists need to be able to get equipment and people over to Europe and the fear is that will stop because it will be too expensive.”But, for Mr Singh, leaving the EU goes so much deeper than his love for music, because his opposition is an ethos, a state of mind. “Cornershop were anti-Brexit even before Brexit was here,” he says.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchGrowing up in Wolverhampton, memories were fresh of Enoch Powell’s racist “Rivers of Blood” speech\u0026nbspin 1968, which claimed\u0026nbspimmigration would lead to violence and did so much damage to race relations.It’s a controversial view, but Mr Singh insists racism was a “motivation” for some who voted for Brexit, but argues people were also angered by years of cuts – which means they will feel betrayed.“These people won’t be satisfied by what happens after Brexit, because there will be yet more cuts to services, the country will be hobbled by Brexit,” he warns.Here he also targets Jeremy Corbyn for “failing to provide leadership by opposing Brexit”, while echoing claims that EU immigration has lowered workers’ wages here.“Corbyn has gone down the same line and said a lot of the rot that the Conservatives put out – and even Ukip,” Mr Singh protests.“Coming out of the EU is not what’s best for workers and workers’ rights. I find it incredible that Labour doesn’t realise that.”Mr Singh will also be marching because, with a French wife, “we have woken up every morning consumed by Brexit since the referendum”.I’m a former soldier who voted for Brexit- but now I regret itCorbyn under fresh pressure to back a Final Say Brexit referendum10,000 young people to lead major demo calling for fresh Brexit voteWhy so many Tory MPs are privately keen on a Final Say referendumShe quickly applied for UK citizenship, which means she is “a lot more secure than others”, but millions of EU citizens here remain fearful about their future rights.“I wonder why many EU citizens even want to stay in the country when you think how badly they have treated,” the singer says. “It is pitiful that it has got to this.”But, with Theresa May still insisting there will be no Final Say referendum – and Mr Corbyn fighting Labour pressure to back one – can Saturday’s march really achieve its aim?“I think so,” he insists. “One year ago, people laughed at the idea of a People’s Vote happening, but, as the truth has come out, the rupee has dropped and people are understanding we must find out what the country feels now.“We now have much more information and people can take a better-informed view about whether we want to leave the EU or not.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hererivers of bloodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Jeremy campaigned for Remain and reform of the EU, travelling almost 3,000 miles during the course of the campaign to speak at events and rallies.”However, one pro-EU Labour MP said he wanted reassurance there was “no truth” in the claim, while Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said it explained why Labour had spent two years “waving through the Conservatives’ Brexit”.Corbyn faces calls to resign from Labour MPsThe podcast, to be broadcast on Wednesday, features an interview with Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave, who says he was told of Mr Corbyn’s comment by the person he said it to.“I understand that during the referendum, he came up to somebody from the Labour Leave campaign and basically said, ‘good on you, keep up the good work’,” Mr Elliott says.During the podcast made for the group UK in a Changing Europe, Mr Elliott is then asked if the comment was made to Kate Hoey, a prominent Labour Leave activist. He replies: “I’m not going to name names.”But he adds: “I think that, with both John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn, their voting records up to the point at which they became leaders of their party was a Eurosceptic voting record.“Also, I think, ideologically, they see the EU in a different way – they see it more as being perhaps a capitalist club.“They see it as being the bosses’ club, undermining workers’ rights and stopping things like nationalisations and all that sort of stuff.”Speaking to The Independent, Mr Elliott again declined to reveal his source, but said: “I was told directly by the Labour Leaver who\u0026nbspCorbyn had spoken to, and have no reason to disbelieve them.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Corbyn has been dogged by allegations that his office undermined Labour’s Remain campaign, made most powerfully by Alan Johnson, the former home secretary, who led it.Immediately after the shock 2016 referendum result, in a leaked letter to colleagues, Mr Johnson described his leader’s performance in the campaign as “risible”.“The lukewarm approach by Jeremy was bad enough but there is no doubt in my mind that at least three of his closest associates in the leader’s office were actively undermining the party’s efforts,” he wrote.“They wanted Leave to succeed and at best Jeremy could not control them at worst, he was sympathetic to their views.”Mr Johnson’s deputy, Labour MP Phil Wilson, echoed the criticism, saying: “Corbyn made only a smattering of campaign appearances, and they were lacklustre in delivery and critical of the EU in tone, resulting in Labour voters not knowing the party’s position or hearing our argument.”Just before Britain went to the polls, Mr Corbyn himself rated his support for remaining in the EU at about “seven, or seven and a half” out of 10.‘No grounds for optimism’ ahead of Brexit summit, says Donald TuskMPs ask police if Government wanted Vote Leave probe ‘soft-pedalled’Brexiteers accused of ‘sniping’ at PM’s Europe adviserEU leaders won’t even consider trade deal with UK at Brexit summitHowever, a year ago, he insisted he voted to stay in the EU and would do so again, saying: “I thought the best option was to remain, I haven’t changed my mind on that.”Chris Leslie, the prominent pro-EU MP, said: “Brexit is a disaster for the least well-off in our society and will usher in a further decade of austerity, which is why so many of us were urging Labour’s leadership to be more supportive of the Remain campaign at the time. I sincerely hope that there is no truth in this report.”And Sir Vince said: “We’ve always suspected that Corbyn wanted to leave the EU and this evidence is damning.“It explains why Corbyn and his acolytes have spent the last two years fudging their position in public while waving through the Conservatives’ Brexit in parliament.”The podcast was made last year but is only being broadcast now for reasons that are unclear.Mr Elliott – who also set up the low-tax Taxpayers’ Alliance pressure group – was being lined to work for Theresa May, but the idea came to nothing.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If it is a boy, both agreed any name would be lovely but “not Charles”. One woman said Americans fascination has to do with “the American and the British coming together and now they’re having a baby, it’s a big deal”. She said she thinks it will be a girl, but her friend said she hoped it would be a little boy. “A classic name, something like Catherine,” is what she wanted for a girl, but the other woman thought a baby boy will be named “Harry Jr” after his father. Several others out and about on a rainy morning were a bit ambivalent about the news, but one woman\u0026nbspcarting around her own toddler\u0026nbspsaid she thinks interest will peak when the duchess begins to debut her pregnancy fashion choices.

While the AfD haven’t gone away, Sunday’s Bavarian elections show that the story is more complicated.The main way conservatives across Europe have reacted to the rise of right-wing populism has been to steal its clothes. If this is what voters want, then they can have it, the centre right has said. And they can get it from us.Britain is the best successful example of this strategy, where Theresa May’s Tories have eaten Ukip by embracing Brexit, lambasting “citizens of nowhere” and swelling their poll share to one they have not enjoyed for decades.Brexit talks: What on earth just happened?But Bavaria is now the best example of where this approach has gone wrong. For months before the election the CSU, the regional conservative allies of Angela Merkel who have dominated politics in the state since 1949, banged on about immigration. They faced down the chancellor and forced changes in refugee policy at a national level. The goal was to show voters there was no need to vote AfD if they wanted to be mean to foreigners.When polling day came on Sunday, the CSU lost a good chunk of voters to the AfD, as expected. But it lost more, according to a polling analysis by Der Spiegel, to the Greens – swathes of its one-time supporters apparently horrified at the party’s increasingly xenophobic tenor.The Greens have been unambiguously pro-refugee and are on the rise across Germany, especially so in Bavaria. They took second place and denied the CSU a majority for only the second time since 1949 – in elections fought under a proportional system.The environmentalists, who are less radical than their UK-based counterparts but nonetheless left of centre, are now flying high in the national polls, with an increasing number of surveys showing them taking second place.They have done this before, a few years ago, when a row over nuclear power was making headlines in Germany. Merkel neutered them simply by adopting their policies and pledging to close down nuclear plants. The pragmatic chancellor may have less room for manoeuvre this time, however – with pressures both to her left and right on immigration.AfD says Islam is not welcomeThere are other strands to the story, too. The social democrats, who are in coalition with Merkel’s conservatives at a federal level, lost voters to basically everyone, sinking for fourth place. Once a force to be reckoned with, they are now in serious need of a rethink and recovery if they are to even survive. They yet show little sign of having the energy to reinvent themselves.Their story is common across Europe, from France to the Netherlands from Greece to Italy where once-powerful centre-left social democratic parties are being eviscerated. Germany’s SPD has taken a particular beating from having twice now signed up to work with the conservatives, with little to show for it. When the government does things wrong they get blamed, when it does things right, they get little credit.Whether the Greens will stay on the up is not certain. German politics for the last decade has been a bit of a carousel, with minor parties getting some time in the sun between general elections as voters search around for an alternative before losing interest. The Greens, the Left, even the Pirate Party, have all at various points had temporary surges – but the only force that has sustained increased support so far has been the far right.But what does look certain is that Germany’s conservative establishment is not immune from the rot that has been afflicting its social democratic one. The centre right in European countries – who across the continent have weathered challenges to their dominance with far more resilience than their left-of-centre counterparts– will be watching with an interested fear.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has potentially serious implications for the weaker UK regions.In the worst-case scenario, some of the most vulnerable regions could suffer a \u0027triple whammy\u0027 - a very significant loss of potential economic output, the loss of EU funding and third, unless fiscal transfers from stronger parts of the UK economy can be maintained at the same level to mitigate these impacts, the combined economic shock could be severe.

As we head towards the start of November, confidence is very low but there are signs it may turn more changeable again.\u0026ldquoTemperatures will probably be close to normal overall, but in more settled weather it is likely to be colder than average, especially overnight.Coronal holes are areas in the matter around the sun \u0026ndash its corona \u0026ndash which have a lower density compared to the rest of the corona and are therefore darker.They form part of the sun\u0026rsquos surface and are in constant motion changing and reshaping emitting solar particles at a varying rate.They are thought to exert an influence over space weather leading to disturbances and are also believed to be linked to patterns of weather on Earth.The current lowest UK temperature recorded during October is -11.7C (10.94F) recorded in 1948 in the Highlands of Scotland.

And try out the windbag oratory on the .million decent British democrats who voted to leave the European Union, and who have been told ever since that they are racist, ignorant ­bigots who should never be allowed near a polling booth.I like Bono. In person, he is a decent, thoughtful man. His band are not bad. But why do the former rebels of rock music always tug their forelocks to the European Union  Why does everyone in leather trousers act like the EU is an unalloyed good thing  Why does rock music have a blind spot when it comes to Brussels How can Bono, right, possibly mistake Jean-Claude Juncker for Joe Strummer   The EU is the ESTABLISHMENT, man! And the EU is the ­establishment at its most ­unaccountable, undemocratic, incompetent and corrupt.The EU is not a beautul thing, Bono. It is a crumbling ­expansionist empire, rotten to the core, merciless in its opposition to democracy.The EU is a gravy train, Bono, a trough for puffed-up political piggies, a sclerotic body of ­privileged old white men in suits with MEPs who do not have to provide receipts for their £,-a-month expenses. The EU really stinks, Bono.And the music that you and I grew up with — the music we loved, the music U and I were inspired by, the music we placed at the centre of our worlds — was meant to be against this kind of thing. Bono bent the knee to the bullies of Brussels in the same week that Bob Geldof sent a ­letter to Theresa May warning her that Brexit will be the day the music dies.“Imagine Britain without its music,” thundered Geldof’s letter, co-signed by musicians including Sting, Ed Sheeran, Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn. “If it’s hard for us, then it’s impossible for the rest of the world. Britain does rule the waves. The airwaves. But Brexit threatens, as it does so much , this vast voice.”But it is simply not true that our country owes its musical genius to the European Union. The golden years of British music were before we joined the EU — when it was still being touted to us as a common market — back in .The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin all somehow managed to make great music without Brussels. Now Geldof and his co-signatories seriously suggest that British music can’t survive outside the European Union.No doubt the Brexit-loathing Boomtown Rat believes this rubbish but everyone  who signed his Whinge Aid letter should have paused to think before signing. Because by claiming that Brexit will kill British music, Ed Sheeran, Sting and the rest just make themselves look like laughably out-of-touch luvvies. Not a good look for the wild boys of rock ’n’ roll.Geldof is right about one thing — British music has been brilliant for  years because our little country embraced the world.But John Lennon, Jimmy Page, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend opened their ears and their hearts to the sounds coming out of America.The glorious music that smashed down the walls between white music and black music was born in Chicago and Nashville and Detroit and Memphis.  Its roots were in the backwoods of the Deep South and the ­Mississippi Delta, and reached all the way back to Africa. Belgium never came into it, Bob.The Rolling Stones never needed a grant from the EU. They just needed one glimpse of Buddy Holly, one listen to Muddy Waters, one nod from Elvis Presley. British bands changed the world and they sure as hell did it without the help of the European Union. Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Bono. But no British musician in history was ever inspired by the mysterious rhythms coming out of Brussels.PETER JACKSON’S new film, They Shall Not Grow Old, shows painstakingly coloured images from World War One for the very first time.Because we have only experienced World War One in black and white footage and photos, there has always felt like a huge distance between our time and the unimaginable horrors of the trenches.Lord Of The Rings director Jackson has bridged that gap and the results, above, take your breath away. He says: “The war was a colour war. You’re seeing it as they saw it. And they saw it in colour.”World War One never felt closer. And the humour, humanity and courage of the men who fought it has never been more heartbreaking.BEST wishes for the future to Trevor Engelson and his bride Tracey Kurland, who were married in a low-key ceremony in Calornia last weekend.Andyou don’t recognise the names, that is because Mr Engelson has chosen to keep a discreet silence on the subject of his two-year marriage to Meghan Markle.And in an age where every broken relationship is ­dissected on social media, isn’t it refreshing to see a man who can keep a dignied silence “WE lost the match but won the battle,” claimed Conor McGregor after his beating in last weekend’s UFC .  What planet was that victory on then, Conor To the casual fan it looked like McGregor  followed up months of denigrating Khabib Nurmagomedov with a feeble performance in the octagon and a lack of grace in defeat.True, Khabib spoilt his victory by jumping into the crowd to continue the punch-up with McGregor’s corner.  But for the le of me I can’t see how Conor McGregor can claim anything other than unconditional surrender. Neither man brought credit to MMA.There is only one reason why mainstream sports fans have been paying interest to Mixed Martial Arts in recent years and that is Conor McGregor.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal was not right.Under such a deal, we would be required to follow EU laws under the EU rule book and we would still be subject to the European Court of Justice.We would be out of Europe, yet still run by Europe. Any proposal that is brought forward and put to Parliament needs to take back control of our laws and make sure the European Court has no say over us.  So what should Theresa May do  The answer, once again, is set out clearly in the  Conservative manesto.It says: “We will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement.”  That’s why the Prime Minister should move on from her Chequers proposal and seek an advanced free-trade deal with the EU. A comprehensive free-trade deal, like the EU’s free-trade deals with Canada and Japan, is what our manesto promises require.Such a deal would ensure we take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade. It would honour the referendum mandate. It would be in line with our manesto commitments. And it would work for the EU too. The Government’s objection to this is the supposed dficulty of keeping an open border in Northern Ireland.For this reason, Government figures claim we cannot seek a trade deal with the EU unless this problem is solved. This is nonsense.Clear proposals have been set out by two former Northern Ireland Secretaries as to how a frictionless border can be maintained under a free-trade agreement. These proposals have been endorsed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Good Friday Agreement architect Lord Trimble.Moreover, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has set out how we can build on the system of joint border controls at Dover to avoid delays or friction at the UK’s borders — including in Ireland. This would work for the EU’s rules and ensure a positive future relationship going forward.This approach is not simply a bad use of taxpayers’ money. It breaks another manesto pledge.For our  manesto says “it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within two years” of our serving notice to leave the EU. In other words, by the end of March next year.So it is wrong for the Government to agree withdrawal terms without sorting out the full detail of our future relationship. A temporary fix does not honour the referendum mandate, it does not keep our manesto promise and it certainly fails to look after our hard-earned money.Moreover, would this temporary fix really be temporary  Just ask the people of Norway how such a deal turned out for them. In  they signed the European Economic Area Agreement. They were told by the EU their sovereignty would be respected. Yet  years later, this “temporary” arrangement has become permanent.Meanwhile, the cost has increased ten-fold and nearly , EU directives and regulations have been implemented through Norway’s EEA agreement.Our Government should fear to tread such a dangerous path. Voters will not tolerate any “temporary” arrangement becoming permanent. They would see it as a betrayal. People voted to leave the EU because they wanted change. They believed in Britain and the land of opportunity we can build. They voted to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade.The Conservative manesto promised that we would leave the EU altogether. That we would seek a free-trade deal and a new national future.Now is the time for the Government to honour the referendum mandate and the Conservative manesto by seeking a free­-trade deal with the EU that enables Britain to become an economic powerhouse in the decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed. When it comes to terrorism, all roads lead back to Riyadh.A respectable MP, who does not joke about such matters, tells me the Saudi Embassy in London once had a torture chamber in the basement.I wonderit still does Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner.

Now ministers are set to use the time to fix problems in the system - but the programme wont be halted or scrapped.A series of documents revealed that a whole raft of new changes could be coming to make the transition easier for Brits -they are signed off by the Treasury.It comes after a revolt by Tory backbenchers who demanded that extra cash be put in to soften the blow for Brits on benefits.Plans have been drawn up to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to continue paying some benefits to claimants for two weeks after their new Universal Credit claim has been made.Housing benefit tenants can already get this two week space, after reports of Brits going into debt at last years Budget.The documents also revealed that more help would be given to the self employed, and that the advance payments will be spread out and paid back over a longer amount of time.Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said today the news was proof that the government have quietly accepted that their flagship social security programme isnt working.She went on: The Government must stop the roll out of Universal Credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about whats going on and what action the Government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.And ex-Labour MP Frank Field said the changes that could take place arent enough - and demanded benefits must continue until the new benefit is up and running into your bank account and that paying back advance payments more slowly should include other historic debts too.Dame Louise Casey said the design was flawed from the outset and it had pushed people further and further into debt because it tried to force people to be paid monthly.She told Radio : The poorest people are often paid weekly and fortnightly - those are the people we need to help... Civil servants are telling ministers this is a mess, and it needs fixing.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Even Philippa Stroud, who used to work for the DWP, added that more money needed to be pumped in to offset cuts: Universal Credit is the right mechanism for delivering welfare, but it needs the investment restored.Campaigners including Citizens Advice welcomed the proposed moves, but said that it wouldnt solve all of the problems.Universal Credit aims to roll six benefits into one monthly payment, but the controversial new programme has been hit by a string of problems.First announced in , it was meant to be fully up and running by  - this has now been pushed back to .The new system had also been attacked for taking weeks for claimants to get their first payment, and for stopping domestic abuse victims from leaving their partners as benefits are now only paid into one account per family.Analysis from Labour revealed yesterday that Universal Credit sanctions hit Brits under  the hardest.A Department for Work and Pensions statement said today that it would be putting back the rollout.A spokesperson said: We have long said that we will take a slow and measured approach to managed migration. This will not begin in January , but later in the year, after a period of preparation.For a further year we will then begin migration working with a maximum of , people, continuing with our ‘test and learn’ approach. This is to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptions as we go.We will publish full plans for the next stage of Universal Credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks.Claimants are able to get some cash within five days or on the same day they make a claim in emergency cases - rather than waiting weeks for their first Universal Credit payment.But the upfront payment is a loan which means youll have to pay it back.The repayments will be automatically deducted from your Universal Credit payments after youve taken the loan.You should ask for the advanceyou dont think youll have enough money to live on between when you apply and when youll get your first payment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442068552.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather forecast sunshine temperature","story":"A foggy start will give way to sunny skies and balmy temperatures across the South East as forecasters predicted business as usual in the coming months.Temperatures will climb to C in London, while Norwich and the South East could top C despite the time of year, with some rain possible later.Tomorrow the mercury will dip to around the mid teens across the UK and to C in Glasgow, with blustery showers possible in Scotland amid mainly sunny conditions.And dry sunshine is expected on Thursday across the country, with a cool C feeling considerably warmer.The fresh but sunny weather is set to continue into the weekend, with temperatures topping C from Belfast to London and only limited rain forecast for the coming week.Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill indicated the dramatic weather that has lashed the UK in the past weeks had come to an end.He told the Sun Online: The weather we can expect in the coming months is standard for this time of the year and were not expecting to see another Storm Callum.If anything for most parts of the UK temperatures are more likely to be higher than average -

Now ministers are set to use the time to fix problems in the system - but the programme wont be halted or scrapped.The documents also revealed that more help would be given to the self employed, and that the advance payments will be spread out and paid back over a longer amount of time.Last weekend ministers were forced to deny they were planning an emergency electionTheresa May’s deal fails to get passed in the Commons.Steven Saxby - Labour’s parliamentary candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster, told The Sun Online that he’s seen people in his area who are “terried” about going on to Universal Credit - and the issue could win Labour seats.“Universal Credit isn’t working for most people, it’s a slap in the face for poor and vulnerable working families in areas like Westminster,” he said.“It’s better to scrap it - people associate this toxic brand with something that’s cruel and harmful.”Ministers have insisted no one will be worse off going on to the new system when it’s rolled out for people who are on the old benefits next year.Those on housing benefit, child tax credits and job seekers’ allowance will be made to go onto Universal Credit in the coming months.If you are experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover it, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The new system aims to simply the Department for Work and Pensions, and give all claimants one single monthly payment.But Tory MPs are already rebelling about the rollout - after it emerged that millions could be £ a month worse off after the switch.The Government has promised £ billion worth of transitional protections, but it’s not known how long that cash will last.A group of MPs - led by architect of Universal Credit, Iain Duncan Smith, wants Philip Hammond to plough an extra £billion into the system in the upcoming Budget to offset the cuts introduced by George Osborne."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442070569.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit deal theresa may cabinet meeting","story":"The PM spent nearly three hours laying out her strategy to the rest of the Cabinet after rumours ministers were prepared to quit.And she served up bacon, sausage and egg sandwiches to the warring team - in a jokey reference to the pizza party eight ministers hosted last night.Mrs May told the Cabinet: Im convinced thatwe as a Government stand together and stand firm we can achieve this.A No spokesman insisted no ministers threatened to resign in protest against the PMs Brexit plans.But Mrs May is still fighting off a rebellion from her DUP allies - as they threaten to block her domestic agendashe doesnt accept their demands on Brexit.Tomorrow the PM will travel to Brussels where she will make the case for her Chequers plan in front of other EU leaders.Today senior Eurocrats Michel Barnier and Donald Tusk both said a deal is unlikely to be struck this week and called on the UK side to break the deadlock.Mr Barnier said: We must find a solution to ensure that there is no hard border in any circumstance on the island of Ireland. We are not there yet.Several subjects remain open, including Ireland. We need more time to find this global agreement and achieve the decisive progress we need to finalise this negotiation on Britains orderly withdrawal.We will take this time, calmly and seriously, to find this global agreement in the next weeks.And Mr Tusk added: Unfortunately, the report on the state of negotiations that I got from Michel Barnier today, as well as yesterdays debate in the House of Commons, give me no grounds for optimism before tomorrows European Council summit on Brexit.As I see it, the only grounds for hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides. However, for a breakthrough to take place we need more than goodwill, we need new facts.Tomorrow I am going to ask Prime Minister Mayshe has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determinea breakthrough is possible.Last night, a group of eight senior ministers met over spicy meat pizza to air their frustration about the PM.The ministers who gathered in Andrea Leadsoms office included Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Liz Truss.They reportedly agreed they should continue backing Mrs May as she battles to fight off Brussels attempts to carve off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary who attended the meeting, said today: No one is planning on resigning. We are all doing our jobs and we are trying to get the best deal for this country, and thats it.BREXITEERS will never be forgiven for making  promises to the British people, John Major claimed tonight.The former PM insisted the UKs vote to quit the EU was a colossal misjudgement - saying those who campaigned for it have much to answer for.And he blasted Boris Johnson for undermining Theresa Mays efforts to secure a Brexit deal.In a speech in London this evening, Sir John said: We know the post-Brexit world will be very dferent from now.It cannot be otherwise, because no form of Brexit will remotely match up to the promises made by the Leave campaign in the referendum - they were vote-gathering fantasies, not serious politics.It will damage our national and personal wealth, and may seriously hamper our future security. It may even, over time, break up our United Kingdom. It will most definitely limit the prospects of our young.And - once this becomes clear - I believe those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for. They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer.That will never be forgotten - nor forgiven.The former Tory leader is now campaigning for a second referendum on Brexit to overturn the result of the  vote.Labour MP Virendra Sharma, a backer of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, mocked the ministers for failing to launch a challenge to the PM.He said: After days of briefing about their plot we expected these Brexiteers to give the Prime Minister a pizza their mind. It seems like they folded quicker than a calzone.And Tory backbenchers have denied they want to force Mrs May out of office.Steve Baker, the Brexiteers shop steward, admitted: “There really isn’t time for a long leadership contest. And there aren’t the Eurosceptic numbers to change Prime Minister.”But Mrs May could face a tougher challenge from the DUP, which is propping up her majority in Parliament.Nigel Dodds, the partys leader in Westminster, said thatshe tries to put a border in the Irish Sea the DUP will say: How can we continue implement your domestic agenda, your budgets and everything  He added: Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act there are a lot of things that we can not support in terms of the government’s domestic and financial and welfare agenda which does not trigger the possibility of Jeremy Corbyn coming into No.”This week European leaders warned that No Deal is closer than ever after talks between officials broke down on Sunday night.But Mrs Mays ministers have insisted that eventhere isnt a Brexit deal this week, one could be struck at a special summit next month.The respected peer called on the PM to start building lorry parks and drawing up customs forms so that Britain is ready for disruption at our borders.Lord Hague also said Mrs May should consider ripping up the blueprint for Brexit negotiations - and consider signing up to the European Economic Area for the next three years.He warned the Tories are at breaking point as MPs row over whether or not to back the PM as she heads to Brussels for talks with European leaders.The former Foreign Secretary said: It is now essential to turn up to full throttle the preparations for leaving without a deal.Yes, that sadly means everything from printing customs forms to building lorry parks in Kent.A No Deal Brexit is extremely undesirable, and might be prevented by Parliament, but since it could happen it has to be prepared for psychologically and politically, not just logistically.He added that fresh thinking - which could include adopting an EEA solution to give the Government more time to negotiate a deal - could help Mrs May shore up her position."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442069844.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"new photos sunken british tanks d day","story":"The war tanks sunk during Operation Smash - a huge training exercise held on a Dorset beach in April , just weeks ahead of the Normandy landings.Six lives were lost during the drill - but a lesson was learnt so that, on D-Day, British and Canadian tanks were launched in shallow water.Nick Reed from The Isle of Purbeck Sub Aqua Club, which has launched a project to map the history of the seven sunken tanks, said the six soldiers lost did not die in vain.Everybody says that Operation Smash was an absolute, complete disaster, said Nick.Well,  tanks were launched and seven sank, so that means  got to shore in this exercise and from that the British learnt a lesson.So when the British and Canadians launched their tanks on D-Day, they didnt launch theirs offshore because it was too rough.Whereas the Americans launched theirs five kilometres offshore.The result of the American decision is well-known - just two of the  tanks initially deployed to storm Omaha beach made it ashore.Omaha would be the bloodiest of the D-Day beaches.If we hadnt got armoured support ashore on D-Day, our troops may not have established a beach head, said Mr Reed.So in many ways the sacrice of those six guys may have changed the course of World War Two - thats the way we like to think of it.Their sacrice wasnt in vain, things were learnt from it and maybe that contributed to the success of D-Day.Conditions at the e site off Studland Beach are notoriously changeable, making the sunken tanks a challenge to photograph.The new images of them are thought to be the clearest ever taken.Paul Pettitt, who photographed the wrecks with his we Alison, said: Its rough as you like.Those pictures were done over the course of a whole summer. Some days we went down and werent able to get anything.The worst problem is the wind direction which kicks up the silt and sand on the bottom, and makes it go very gloomy down there.But we got a lucky break one day when we got some really clear visibility and were able to get these pictures.The tanks have also taken on new lives as articial reefs.Theyre absolutely full of wildle, said Mr Reed.There are several big conger eels living in one of the main tanks, theres crabs, theres lobsters, theres big shoals of fish that swim around them.Thats almost like a commemoration of the men themselves - men died on these tanks but these tanks now are providing le to the marine animals around the area.The Duplex Drive Valentine tanks were equipped with a buoyant canvas screen which could be raised up around the tank and sat above the water line.But soon after the tanks were launched the wind changed and water started to sweep over the top of the screens.They were launched in suitable conditions but the wind blew up just after they were launched, said Mr Reed.The skirts, which provided the buoyancy, were only about a metre above the water - and obviously what keeps water out will keep water in.So I think most of them were swamped and sank.Earlier this year, a man believed to be the last-surviving soldier from Operation Smash - who is also a crew member from one of the doomed tanks - was located.Albert Price, , is now living in the West Midlands.Its hoped hell be able to attend a  year commemoration of Operation Smash next year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442115238.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"terrified mum posts 50 an hour job ad for someone to take her kids trick or treating on halloween","story":"The single mother, who suffers from severe social anxiety, is offering £-an-hour to look after her three young children.She said that she gets “very scared at Halloween because of the costumes and speaking to strangers to ask for sweets for the kids.”She posted the ad on on Childcare, a site connecting parents with nannies, tutors and babysitters with more than . million users nationwide.Her post, which was submitted last week, is a last resort as she has been unable to find anyone  to treat her kids.But the mum won’t let that stop her three children, aged nine, seven and three, having a great time.The ad calls for a professional to help the children into their costumes and lead them trick or treating from pm to pm on October .The founder of Childchare, Richard Conway, said: “When I saw this advert put onto the website, I wanted to help the woman instantly.“She’s clearly trying to do the best for her children and is more than happy to pay someone to perform this service.“I got in touch with her to ask how I could help, and promoting this advert seemed like the best way I could help her.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442144753.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pippa middleton birth baby boy","story":"The -year-old socialite delivered the lb and oz baby on Monday and he will be cousin to Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said they were thrilled.Just days earlier, Pippa showed off her ample bump at Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbanks star-studded St Georges Chapel wedding.A spokeswoman for Pippa and her husband said: Everyone is delighted and mother and baby are doing well.James, , was spotted running into hospital yesterday morning apparently in the same clothes he arrived in the day before.He was clutching a duffle bag likely containing much needed supplies to help the young family prepare for their second night as parents.Pippa gave birth on the same private £,-a-night Lindo Wing of St Marys Hospital where her sister had George, Charlotte and Louis.Kensington Palace said in a short statement: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are thrilled for Pippa and James.Pippa and James arrived hours after the announcement that Meghan Markle is pregnant and expecting a baby with Prince Harry in the Spring.The new parents joined the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Cambridges at Princess Eugenies Windsor Castle bash on Friday.Pippa already visited the exclusive Lindo Wing, where sister Kate gave birth to all three of her children.The Duchess of Cambridge posed on the steps of the ward with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, shortly after each of their births.The pricey ward is popular with royals, with Princess Diana having both of her children there, and she also stood for photos on the steps with Princes William and Harry.Pippa and James were spotted visiting the wing, in St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, which is a stone’s throw from their £ million mansion in Cha earlier on in her pregnancy.The exclusive wing provides a premium service for expectant and new mothers, with all patients given a private room with an en suite, which comes with phones and fridges.Deluxe rooms or suites are also available for anyone willing to fork out – and it’s thought Kate gave birth in one of these.There are in-room services for new mums including massages, and there’s also a supervised nursery so you drop off your new-born while you indulge.The wing also offers satellite TV with major international channels as well as radio, WiFi and newspapers.They have extensive menus and can cater for any dietary requirement, and there’s also a wine list – with champagne – to accompany it.If you’re still hungry, there’s also an afternoon tea service.Prices start at £,-per-night for a standard room, while a deluxe will set you back £,.A suite, where Kate is thought to have stayed, costs £,-per-night, and it’s thought Pippa may also go for this option.The wing is known for catering for a range of famous and wealthy women, and many high-profile parents are willing to pay for their discretion.Pippa, who tied the knot last May, announced she was pregnant in June.And Pippa Middleton will also be copying Kate when it comes to another royal baby tradition.Plus here’s everything you need to know about Pippa Middleton and James Matthews’ baby.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh, and Brexit’s one of the craziest moves he’s heard of. “I’m depressed because I’m sleeping on a futon in a damp country with warm beer and a public that wants to leave Europe, when there would be no Europe without you,” propounds the outspoken filmmaker. “Twice in the past century you offered up hundreds of thousands of lives so that there would be a Europe. “You know, you don’t get to leave. It’s only there because of your sacrice and out of gratitude the rest of Europe said your language will be the language of Europe. Sorry French. “Europe looks up to Britain, is grateful to Britain for saving Europe, then you just wake up one day and say, ‘we’re leaving’. What was so wrong ”  Moore, half an hour late and looking ashe’s just climbed out of that futon, rants about the many reasons there could be for Brexit, from fishing quotas to controlling our borders. “Just say, we’re f***ing Britain... for Christ’s sake. We only have one cuisine and it’s fish and chips...” is his negotiating stance on quotas. Ruling out taxation as a reason to go, Moore explodes rhetorically again. “And don’t say it’s immigration because you had a f***ing empire and you’ve had people of colour and people from other countries throughout your entire Commonwealth,” he screams. “If you don’t like it, get rid of the Commonwealth and stop playing those stupid games every two or four years.” Picking the bones out of his shystatements on British politics is trickier than dissecting his US positions. Moore hates Trump, absolutely detests the President. Can he think of a single good thing to say about the Oval Office’s orange resident  “No.”  Trump and Brexit are twin outrages he brackets together. “You have a dumbed-down public – and you can say the same thing about this country too,” is his stinging verdict. The Oscar winner’s new movie about his nemesis, Fahrenheit   – that date taken from the November day after Trump’s shock victory over Hillary Clinton in  – is brutal. This isn’t just the cinema case for Trump’s prosecution. Moore’s the judge and jury who finds the President guilty of crimes against the American people. “He only believes in Donald J Trump. His whole ideology is Trump, so a malignant narcissist is the most dangerous person to have as the leader of any country because everything goes through the filter of ‘how does this affect me, is it good for me ’, not is it good for the people of this country.” Moore also effectively accuses the President of incestuous paedophile tendencies over uncomfortable past behaviour with daughter Ivanka – now a White House aide. “I feel bad for her... evennothing happened, it’s a form of child sexual abuse to go on TV and say the thing you have most in common with your daughter is sex or thatshe weren’t my daughter I’d be dating her,” snorts Moore. “Or he says ‘hi’ to a -year-old and then when she’s out of earshot he says, ‘I’m going to be dating her in  years’.”  The Left-wing crusader argues, correctly, that almost any other figure in public le would be out of a job and probably in courtthey said half the sleazy comments uttered by Trump. “The law says a teacher must reporta child, a student, comes to them and says my dad keeps sayingI wasn’t his daughter he would be dating me, my dad says the thing we most have in common is sex. Here’s a picture of my dad making me sit on his lap and kissing him,” Moore states. “If you showed that to a teacher,a -year-old girl showed that to a teacher, the teacher’s required by law to report that particular inidual to child-protection services. Andyou do not, you could be arrested, as a teacher, on felony charges.” Trump’s speeches lip-synced over Hitler is central to a warning from Moore that the US constitution may no more protect Americans from a tyrannical president than Germany’s saved them from the Nazi leader. “I don’t say Trump was Hitler, I implied Hitler could’ve been Trump –it’s Trump’s voice coming out of Hitler’s mouth, not the other way around,” he says. “I didn’t paint a little moustache on Trump. I took Hitler and defamed him by having Trump coming out of his mouth.” The attack is intensied by accusing an increasingly authoritarian President of fascism. “The fascism of the st Century will not come with concentration camps and swastikas. It will come with a smiley face and a TV show,” Moore says, drawing on the study Friendly Fascism by US professor Bertram Gross.  He invests almost supernatural powers in how well Trump knows his support base. “The whole Stormy Daniels thing, he leaked it. Here’s how smart he is. “His approval ratings had gone down to the low s. Sixty Minutes [an influential US TV show] does the story on Stormy Daniels and, since then, his approval ratings have gone up. He knows his base, he knows that % of white men who voted for him, when they hear he got to have sex with a porn star, doesn’t think that’s a bad thing – that’s a good thing!” The Apprentice  “The beauty of that show and why people liked Trump is that, every week, he got to fire the jerk that you work with at the Daily Mirror. “Everybody works with that jerk and so the fantasy of that show is shyimaginingsomebody could just say to that person, ‘you’re fired’. “That’s why people liked that show– because they know that person. That person’s working down the hall or in the next cubicle.” Moore’s previous films challenged official views: Fahrenheit   on terrorism, Sicko about medical care, while Bowling for Columbine explored how the US gun culture murders tshyhousands of Americans.  He’s aware moaning about the futon and the hotel are first-world problems – genuine anger spiced with a little teasing. In the new film, Moore is hopeful a new generation of grassroots campaigners will defeat Trump. Yesterday, however, he was morose, defeatist. “Hoping for impeachment, hoping for the special prosecutor to indict him – stop hoping, it isn’t going to happen. “If you haven’t figured it out by now, that this guy out-smarted everybody and got into the White House,” admits Moore, . And he confesses: “I’m not in a hopeful place right now, but that’s only because I recognise the seriousness of the situation, how dire our situation is.” The fight is still there, but Moore, the crumpled crusader, recognises this war is far from won.

The former Tory Prime Minister said Brexiteers “persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer”. And he warned: “That will never be forgotten - or forgiven.”Sir John suggested leaving front line politics allowed him to look at Brexit without ambition, party loyalty or his constituents’ views clouding his judgement.His intervention comes just hours before Theresa May jets off to Brussels for a crucial summit with the remaining  EU leaders. Delivering the Michael Quinlan Lecture in Central London, he said: “I have made no  promises about Brexit that I must pretend can still be honoured, even though – in my heart – I know they cannot. “I am free to say absolutely and precisely what I believe about Brexit. And it is this: “I understand the motives of those who voted to leave the European Union: it can – as I well know – be very frustrating. He added: “Nonetheless, after weighing its frustrations and opportunities, there is no doubt in my own mind that our decision is a colossal misjudgement that will diminish both the UK and the EU. “It will damage our national and personal wealth, and may seriously hamper our future security. It may even, over time, break up our United Kingdom. It will most definitely limit the prospects of our young. “And – once this becomes clear – I believe those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for. They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer. “That will never be forgotten – nor forgiven.” Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: John Major is right.The snake oil salesmen of Boris and Gove, the duo who sold the country a pup will never be forgiven. People trusted them and they betrayed that trust and Boris just stormed when it got dficult. He is now off in a huff to ruffle his hair in a corner.Now the Prime Minister is trying to get a deal, even a bad deal, through the ERG and DUP. She is now stuck between a rock and the ERG. John Major is correct, the public are being taken a ride for a few peoples ideological dream. This is the biggest disaster to befall Britain since Suez. Heres Sir John Majors lecture in full  When Mary Quinlan invited me to deliver this lecture I was flattered – and fearful flattered by the opportunity, and fearful about whether I could do justice to such a remarkable man. I first met Michael over  years ago and he left me with two over-riding impressions. First, he was an easy man to like and second, he was even easier to admire. He had a distinguished career as a civil servant, and – to me – exemplied the ideal of public service. It was my experience in Government that, taken as a whole, the best of the Civil Service was the equal of talent in every other sphere of activity and, in Michael’s case, he was not only a public servant – in the true sense of that term – he was also a world-class authority on his subject. Public service matters because, without it, Government is paralysed. Its efficiency is as relevant to public wellbeing as policy itself. This is not universally understood, but it should be: those who use “bureaucrat” as a term of abuse simply don’t understand the wider role of public servants. I hope to speak of this more fully at a later date but, for now, let me observe merely that the State needs its fair share of our brightest and best talent, and it is important we continue to attract them. Michael Quinlan is an exemplar of who and what we need. And, at this moment, our country is in need of all the expertise it can get. We live in a world of flux. Power structures are changing. Allegiances are changing. Little is as it was: even less will remain as it is.  For many millions, the financial crash of a decade ago destroyed their faith in the political and financial world. I am not surprised. The innocent were hurt. Since then, the global market, the on-rush of science, of medicine, and all forms of technological advance, continues to move the world on at an ever–faster pace. Government is a serious and complex business. It is far more important than the trivia of who is “up” and who is “down” in the political stakes – intriguing and newsworthy though that may be. Government is about enhancing our status in the world. Our security. Our economic wellbeing. Our national reputation. Our future prospects. It is about selecting priorities between Government programmes between business and civil society between rich and poor. It involves choices between competition and compassion between young and old or between the component parts of ourUnited Kingdom. Sometimes, the choices are straightforward but, all too often, they can be hideously complex. What Government is not about is cheap grandstanding. It’s not about deceiving the electorate with slogans, or soundbites, or untruths or half-truths. It’s not about windy oratory that says nothing. It’s not about simplistic solutions to intricate problems. It’s not about scapegoating one part of our population to earn the plaudits of another. And – most emphatically – it’s not about princelings fighting for the political crown of Premiership. Coded messages that shriek “I’m the One” are about as subtle as a punch on the nose. Such self-interest is politics at its least attractive. It does not deliver sound government. It destabilises Government. As a general rule, those whose focus is on self-advancement are rarely the most suitable to be entrusted with power. Talk of power moves me on to the post-Brexit role of diplomacy and the Foreign Office. Here – in the Locarno Room – I feel a little inhibited. I recall Harold Wilson speaking in the  Election and asking, as he moved to his peroration: “ … and why do I talk about the Royal Navy ” to be told by a heckler: “Because you’re in Chatham.”.  But I plead “Not Guilty” to that charge. I talk of diplomacy because it is vital to our national interests and, once we leave the EU, we will need to become ever more forceful in pressing those interests. The blunt truth is that – as a nation of  million – our voice is going to be less resonant than as a leading member of a Union of  million. We need, therefore, to compensate – as far as we can – by increasing our foreign policy capability. That must mean more proactive diplomacy. If we retreat solely to our own interests to Fortress Britain to our own national boundaries to the role of on-looker and not innovator – then greater isolation will surely lead to greater irrelevance. But being proactive requires an expansion of our Foreign Service capacity. As an internationalist, I believe such a posture is desirable in all circumstances. Post-Brexit, it will be essential. For decades, our foreign policy has been bolstered by our membership of the EU, and our closeness to the US. Now, we are on the verge of leaving the EU, while the US continues to move towards Asia-Pacic – and away from Europe and the UK. Until now, every US President I have known has considered our relevance to America to be enhanced by our membership of the European Union. Yet very soon – on our current course – we will no longer be able to argue from within the EU for Anglo-American beliefs in free trade open markets and strong defence. Our value – as an ally of America – will decline. Our friends, the Americans, are hard-headed about power. It is romantic folly to think otherwise. Be in no doubt –the UK can no longer serve America’s interests in Europe, she will look where for someone who can. Of course, our relationship won’t collapse: ties of blood, trade and security will remain. But the UK will be even more clearly America’s subordinate and dependent junior partner. No “s”, no “buts”: we will be less relevant. No-one should be bedazzled by folksy talk of our “special relationship”: it is becoming less “special” year by year. At this moment our country needs to focus on policy, not personality on substance, not show on the national interest, not ideology. Because decisions that must soon be taken will shape the futures of our children and grandchildren for many years to come. You will assume that I am referring to Brexit – and I am. But my concern runs far wider than that. However, first Brexit … For centuries, our State schemed and plotted to prevent all Europe uniting against us. Our Monarchs even married off their children and bribed our foreign adversaries in order to maintain alliances. Now, we have chosen to turn our back on all Europe. A long line of former Statesmen will be turning in their graves. Europe gone ….. America going.  We are told our future aim is to be “Global Britain”: that is certainly the right policy, but it is hardly new. It has been the reality for  years. What is new is that much of the world will now perceive Britain to be a middle-sized, middle-ranking nation that is no longer super-charged by its alliances. Suddenly, the world will be a little chillier. If the art of negotiation is to obtain what you seek, then the intention must be to give a little togain a lot more. Such a negotiation is dficult. It benefits from a trusting relationship. From goodwill. It is most likely to succeedrespect is evident on both sides. I cannot know how the Government has conducted negotiations in private with the European Union: very possibly they have met the tenets I have set out. But, eventhey have , belligerent noises-off – on a daily basis – have built up ill-will, and made the Prime Minister’s task even more dficult. We know the post-Brexit world will be very dferent from now. It cannot be otherwise, because no form of Brexit will remotely match up to the promises made by the Leave Campaign in the referendum: they were vote-gathering fantasies, not serious politics.

Meghan and Harry arrived in Dubbo looking every inch the loved-up newlyweds as they held hands hand gazed into each others eyes. Down-to-earth Meghan has been credited with helping the monarchy break away from its restrained, uptight stereotype with her warm, touchy-feely approach to royal duties. The pair, who are expecting their first baby in spring, stepped off the plane to an incredibly warm welcome as they kicked off day two of their Royal Tour.

Meghan and Harrys Royal Tour so far in pictures as Duke and Duchess begin day two in Australia Meghan is wearing Aussie label Outlander jeans, a shirt by Maison Kitsune, boots by J Crew, a jacket from the Serena Williams collection and an Aussie label Natalie Martin necklace. Their first engagement of the day will see them meet representatives of the Royal Flying Doctors Service- who travel across Australia delivering vital and often urgent medical care to those living in remote parts of the country. The Duke and Duchess will attend the naming dedication and unveiling of a new aircraft in the RFDS fleet as part of celebrations for  years of delivering healthcare to those in need. During their walk through the hangar they will have an opportunity to meet with local RFDS health workers and community members who have benefited from the important work.  The Australian RFDS was the world’s first flying doctors service. Day two of the Royal Tour comes as Australia remains gripped by Royal baby fever, according to local media. Meghan and Harry made the pregnancy announcement shortly after landing in Australia to begin their first oversees tour as a married couple. In a tweet sent out by Kensignton Palace, the announcement read: Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of .  Speaking yesterday morning , a senior Palace source said: “Everyone is hugely excited about the news. The whole of the family are very happy they were all able to congratulate the couple in person before they left for their first major overseas tour. Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland , who lives in Los Angeles, Calornia, is said to very happy about this lovely news - while Thomas Markle reportedly found out from his ex-we as opposed to hearing the news from Meghan. A Palace spokesperson added that the proud mother is looking forward to welcoming her first grandchild. The Royal Tour includes  days of around  engagements - some of which have been carefully tailored with Meghans pregnancy in mind. Parts of the tour include a visit to Fiji and Tonga - areas affected by Zika, a virus which is harmful to pregnant woman and can cause borth deformities.  Despite this, the Duchess of Sussex will travel to Fiji - but is is under strict orders to stay away from rainforests and jungles on Pacic islands. The virus is a “moderate” risk on both islands. A palace source said: “They sought out top medical advice.” Zika is transmitted by mosquitoes, which feed between dusk and dawn. Official advice states: “Pregnant women should consider postponing non-essential travel until after the pregnancy.” But we can reveal organisers have created an itinerary that will let Meghan forgo outside events at the crucial times and stay away from more prevalent areas, such as rural environments.

Talk about great timing. There’s nothing like a royal baby to put everyone – well, most people – in a good mood, evenit is just for a day or two. It gets people talking to each other, something we don’t do enough of these days as we rush about with our busy lives. Inevitably, some commentators have made much of the fact the baby will be the first mixed-race child to have “royal blood”. To hear them speak you’d think they were discussing an episode of Game of Thrones.  In the two years the couple have been together they’ve done so much to reposition the image of monarchy that the idea of a royal baby born with an African-American grandmother doesn’t seem as far-fetched as it would have been years ago. I asked most of my black friends and family what they thought about the announcement. All were excited about the news, even the men. One even declared “the fairlytale continues”. What did they think about the fact the baby will be of mixed race heritage  Not one of them cared. They were more excited about Prince Harry becoming a dad. If May’s royal wedding showed us anything, it was that this is a thoroughly modern couple who embrace all aspects of each other’s backgrounds. Andanyone’s worried about the new arrival being cut off from his or her cultural background, just remember the little one will be doted on by graceful grannie Doria Ragland. If she is able to pass on to her grandchild some of the values she instilled in Meghan when raising her, she’ll have done a great job. Of course, the trolls have come out in force – some of the comments and tweets are just ridiculous.

Her novel Milkman, tells the story of an -year-old girls encounters with sex, sectarianism and social coercion in an unnamed province. Burns is the first UK-born winner of the prize since Hilary Mantel in  and the th woman to win in the Man Bookers -year history. Welcomed as a novel that will help people think about Me Too, it has also been praised for a unique first-person voice rich in the conversational language of Northern Ireland and its handling of universal problems facing women and outsiders. Judges have said they did not consider the current prominence of Northern Ireland or the gender equality debate in their deliberations, nor was the accessibility of the book to average readers on the Tube. Milkman has been hailed as a book that will last by the chairman of the  of judges, philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, who said the novel was as useful for thinking about fractured societies in Lebanon and Syria as it was for the current gender debate in the West.  The chairman said he was resigned to the novel being linked to the Me Too movement, but said the work was more universal. Appiah said at a ceremony at the Guildhall in London: It speaks to the future. I think its going to last. I think this will help people to think about Me Too. Its not just about something that is going on in this moment. This is about the way in which men and women put pressure on a young girl to do things sexually that she doesnt want to do. It had to do with a masculine environment. This is particular, but its brilliantly universal. Its in the context of a sectarian, ided society. Milkman charts the course of a young girl with an ambivalent attitude to the paramilitary violence around her, struggling to combat unwanted sexual advances and the pernicious power of gossip.  Belfast-born Burns fourth novel uses a first-person voice rich in the conversational language of Northern Ireland, although the setting is never made explicit in the work. Lack of paragraphing adds a challenge for the reader. Questioned on whether the work was too challenging for the average reader, Appiah defended the choice saying: I have never thought that being readable on the Tube was an important feature of a novel. Crime writer Val McDermid, critic Leo Robson, writer and critic Jacqueline Rose and graphic novelist Leanne Shapton were the other judges for this years prize. Issues of Brexits impact on Northern Ireland and the cultural awareness of gender issues did not play a role in their choice of winner, the chair has confirmed. Appiah said: I would not have said guyswe dont pick a woman were going to get in trouble for this. Samewe were drting towards picking a man. We were not thinking about it. I really think this is a very original novel. We had never read anything like this before.  Its written in an amazing voice. This is a book about more than one thing. It is about many things. Its quite amazing. Appiah said the s deliberations had been friendly and the decision entirely unanimous, adding that there was no need for a vote and the choice was clear for the judges. Milkman was selected from a shortlist including youngest shortlisted writer, Daisy Johnson with Everything Under, Richard Powers The Overstory, Esi Edugyans Washington Black, Rachel Kushners The Mars Rooms and Robin Robertsons The Long Take.

Brutal.Another said: The only thing I will say about the announcement about Harry and Meghans imminent baby is that it seems a little horrid that they told the family at Eugenies wedding on Friday. Talk about raining on her parade! However, it seems that those reports were unfounded and most of the major royals actually knew about the pregnancy before the wedding - including the happy couple.According to Bazaar , a source said that Harry and Meghan did not break the news to their family at the wedding.The Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, and Eugenie and Jack all knew about Meghans pregnancy before the wedding, but hadnt seen the Sussexes in person until Friday - making the wedding the first time these members of the royal family could congratulate the couple in person.  It is not known whether Prince William and Kate Middleton knew about the pregnancy ahead of time, but given how close the couple are to Harry and his we, it is likely they would have shared the news. Its thought the rest of the royal family were not aware of the pregnancy before Eugenies wedding. This pregnancy revelation explains the story behind several photographs and videos from the wedding of Harry and Meghan chatting to his relatives, who would likely be congratulating them for the first time.

The royal couple were visiting Dubbo Senior College to see the work of the Clontarf Foundationand the Girls’ Academy, nationwide programmes that improves the educational outcomes of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The students said how inspirational it was to meet “role model” Meghan. Kieasha Ross, , said: “Us being Aboriginal girls and her being of a dferent race and being accepted into the royal family shows us anyone can be accepted. “It’s great that someone who’s bi-racial and American can do this [marry into the Royal Family]. “It makes her a role model.”  As Harry and Meghan arrived, the heavens opened. They were first given a traditional “Acknowledgement of Country” greeting by Tiarnie McBride, , and John Hill, , whose grandfather is one of the most respected Aboriginal elders in Dubbo. Then the couple ided their time, with Harry meeting the boys of the Clontarf Academy, which uses sport to encourage kids to stay at school longer, while Meghan went to meet the girls in one of their classrooms. As she entered, all the girls giggled nervously and said: “Oh she’s so beautul!” “I’m very happy to be here” beamed Meghan.  Student Shakira McGrath-Nolan, , showed Meghan a photo wall with the girls on ious trips and doing sport. Then she showed her the girls’ attendance chart for the year with every girls’ name on the board and their attendance record. Shakira got slightly nervous and stumbled over her words, so the Duchess reassured her with a pat and rub of her back. “You’re doing great, keep going” she said softly.  Later Shakira said: “I was so nervous but she told me ‘You’ll be alright’ and that made me feel better. “She’ll be a great mum. “She’s so pretty!”. Another student showed her the Girls’ Academy logo ‘Develop a girl, Change a Community’. Meghan laughed: “That’s speaking my language” she said. She then sat down with six of the teenagers to chat about their hopes and aspirations. One asked her: “Did you like your flight ” Slightly surprised, the Duchess said: “Yes it was great, long, and we’re very happy to be here.”  Afterwards Kieasha said: “We were talking about the Girls’ Academy and its values. “She asked us what we wanted to do when we left school and our dreams and desires. “We asked her about her impression of Australia and she said she loved it. “She inspired us. “Some of the girls want to go into social work and she said how her mum did it and it was very rewarding. “And she and Harry brought the rain! “Everyone has been praying for rain and it comes today of all days.” The couple were meant to meet the girls’ netball team and boys’ rugby teams on the school pitches but the torrential rain forced everyone under cover. The couple were mobbed by excited teens, all wanting to shake their hands, give them flowers and take pictures. The school principal tried to restore some kind of order to no avail. As more and more kids pressed in, Harry and Meghan made their escape through the school hall.  Harry told pupils at the academy, which aims to improve the le skills, self-esteem, and employment prospects of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young men, about the importance of talking to friends about personal problems. The duke, who has spoken in the past about his own mental issues, said: There is a stigma still attached from our parents and grandparents time not to talk about mental health. And he encouraged the youngsters to talk about their mental health issues with each other. Earlier in the day Meghan and Harry were greeted by children who met them from the plane with open arms in an incredibly warm welcome to Dubbo. Harry and Meghan dished out hugs for an excited welcoming party of  flag-waving local schoolchildren at the town’s airport. They included five-year-old Luke Vincent, who rushed up to cuddle the pair prompting beaming smiles from the royal visitors. The cheeky youngster who told teachers his “favourite person” is Father Christmas began playfully stroking Harry’s beard. The little boy, a kindergarten pupil at Buningyong Public School, was transfixed by the Duke’s facial hair, according to the school’sPrincipal Anne Van Dartel.“He got a hug from Meghan and then Harry bent down to speak to him and Luke didn’t give him any choice!” she said. “Luke’s favourite person in the world is Santa Claus, who has a beard. So he rubbed Harry’s beard. “It’s been a wonderful experience for these little country kids to meet people they’ve only ever seen on TV.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle harry hands feeding","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry get hands-on feeding cows at drought-hit Dubbo farm on first Royal TourThe Duke and Duchess met to diccuss the impact of drought on their lives- and how rural workers manage with changing environmental conditionsShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video harry-meghan-hands-dirty-feed-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry got hands-on feeding cows at a drought-hit Dubbo farm.

The whole of the family are very happy they were all able to congratulate the couple in person before they left for their first major overseas tour.

A Palace spokesperson added that the proud mother is looking forward to welcoming her first grandchild. The Royal Tour includes  days of around  engagements - some of which have been carefully tailored with Meghans pregnancy in mind. Parts of the tour include a visit to Fiji and Tonga - areas affected by Zika, a virus which is harmful to pregnant woman and can cause borth deformities.  Despite this, the Duchess of Sussex will travel to Fiji - but is is under strict orders to stay away from rainforests and jungles on Pacic islands. The virus is a “moderate” risk on both islands. A palace source said: “They sought out top medical advice.” Zika is transmitted by mosquitoes, which feed between dusk and dawn. Official advice states: “Pregnant women should consider postponing non-essential travel until after the pregnancy.” But we can reveal organisers have created an itinerary that will let Meghan forgo outside events at the crucial times and stay away from more prevalent areas, such as rural environments.

Stephanie Lynn had a skull and roses inked on her left arm seven years ago but wanted the tattoo removed before her wedding next year. The -year-old booked a tattoo removal appointment with cosmetics company Fresh Faced in Glasgow. But the mum-of-two claims that after two visits to their clinic in the city’s Royston Dental Practice, her arm was “fried” and became severely infected.Now she claims she may have to postpone her wedding because her permanent scars have ruined her confidence, the Daily Record reported . Stephanie, who had the laser removal surgery in July and September, said: “When I got the tattoo I was just young and stupid. “I went to get it removed and had a patch test which went fine. I put numbing cream on a couple of hours before it and when I got my first lasering I really didn’t notice much. “But the second time, it was just horric. I knew something wasn’t right.  “The girl who was doing it left me in so much pain. It felt like she was burning my arm. She put soothing gel over the top but after two days, my arm got swollen. It was like four times its size. “I couldn’t straighten it. I know it’s normal to have swelling but not like this. “It’s like an electric shock went through my arm. It looked like flesh-eating bugs had attacked it – it looked horrible.”  Stephanie, of Parkhead, Glasgow, claims that when she reported the infection to Fresh Faced, she was told to go to their pharmacy.

Benita Woodley, , one of the fth generation of the family on the farm, said: “She saidyou go to someone’s house you always bring something, so she did.  “She said she was worried about the bananas, that she’d put too many bananas in it.

The breeding cattle have suffered particularly in the drought, with hay and feed being imported from other parts of Australia to keep them going.

US gossip website Radar Online claimed a source said the announcement angered Eugenie, who was already dealing with stress of criticism over her pricey wedding.

The -year-old daughter of the Duke of York has now released five beautul images from her big day. But a body language expert has noted one key dference between her official portraits and those of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - and it paints a rather sad picture. After all, it would be dficult to stop yourself drawing comparisons between the two weddings, which took place just five months apart in the exact same chapel in Windsor Castle.  Judi James, a body language expert who frequently writes forand has made numerous TV appearances, told OK about the similarities in the images. She noted that both couples stood in the centre of their family units looking radiant and happy. But there was one big dference between the photos she spotted - and its all to do with the spacing between the couples and their relatives. In Harry and Meghans portrait with their families, everyone is tightly packed together and Meghans mum Doria stands close by her side - so close, in fact, that the two women are touching.  On the other side, Harrys father Prince Charles stands close to his son alongside we Camilla, with the Queen and Prince Philip sitting on chairs in front of them. However, in Eugenies snap there is an enormous gap between the bride and her parents, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew. In fact, there is a lot of empty space in the photo on Eugenies side, with a gap between her and her sister, Princess Beatrice.  On Jacks half of the image, his mother, father and brother stand close by his side. Judi told OK : Sadly Eugenies mother Sarah was put at the outer edge of the line-up, with Beatrice filling the huge gap between mother, father and daughter. The distance between Eugenie and her parents means her father is at the very far end of the line-up, which makes Eugenies closest family members look rather distant. Its Jacks parents that supply the support here, standing alongside their son and holding one anothers hands to show unity – especially with their other son beside Jacks mother. It could be that Sarah Ferguson has been moved to the right of the photo thanks to her rocky history with the royal family.  She famously caused one of the familys biggest scandals in  when photographs of her financial advisor sucking her toe were published in the media just months after her split from Prince Andrew. It has been reported that Prince Philip has had a rocky relationship with the Duchess of York ever since.

The eminent scientist tackled some of les biggest mysteries in his book Brief Answers To The Big Questions. In it he said the human race will learn to transcend the Earth - but he had a word of warning about articial intelligence. Prof Hawking was convinced that computers could outstrip human intelligence within  years - meaning they could be dangeroustheir goals start to dfer.  Here are some of the key questions that he answered in his final text:Is there a God We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation: there is probably no heaven and afterle either.Will humans live in space We will transcend the Earth and learn to exist in space.Is it possible to travel through time Travel back in time cant be ruled out according to our present understanding. Should we be worried about articial intelligence We may face an intelligence explosion that ultimately results in machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails. When that happens, we will need to ensure that the computers have goals aligned with ours. Its tempting to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere science fiction, but this would be a mistake — and potentially our worst mistake ever.Should genetic engineering be used to create superhumans Laws will probably be passed against genetic engineering with humans. But some people wont be able to resist the temptation to improve human characteristics, such as size of memory, resistance to disease andof le. Once such superhumans appear, there are going to be major political problems with the unimproved humans who wont be able to compete.Is Brexit a good thing Unfortunately we cannot go back in time. With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.

Omaha would be the bloodiest of the D-Day beaches. “If we hadn’t got armoured support ashore on D-Day, our troops may not have established a beach head,” said Mr Reed. “So in many ways the sacrice of those six guys may have changed the course of World War Two – that’s the way we like to think of it. “Their sacrice wasn’t in vain, things were learnt from it and maybe that contributed to the success of D-Day.” Conditions at the e site off Studland Beach are notoriously changeable, making the sunken tanks a challenge to photograph. Worthless cowards decapitate World War I soldier memorial leaving it damaged beyond repairThe new images of them are thought to be the clearest ever taken. Paul Pettitt, who photographed the wrecks with his we Alison, said: “It’s rough as you like. “Those pictures were done over the course of a whole summer. Some days we went down and weren’t able to get anything. “The worst problem is the wind direction which kicks up the silt and sand on the bottom, and makes it go very gloomy down there. “But we got a lucky break one day when we got some really clear visibility and were able to get these pictures.” The tanks have also taken on new lives as articial reefs. “They’re absolutely full of wildle,” said Mr Reed. “There are several big conger eels living in one of the main tanks, there’s crabs, there’s lobsters, there’s big shoals of fish that swim around them. “That’s almost like a commemoration of the men themselves – men died on these tanks but these tanks now are providing le to the marine animals around the area.” The Duplex Drive Valentine tanks were equipped with a buoyant canvas screen which could be raised up around the tank and sat above the water line.  But soon after the tanks were launched the wind changed and water started to sweep over the top of the screens. “They were launched in suitable conditions but the wind blew up just after they were launched,” said Mr Reed. “The skirts, which provided the buoyancy, were only about a metre above the water – and obviously what keeps water out will keep water in. “So I think most of them were swamped and sank.” Earlier this year, a man believed to be the last-surviving soldier from Operation Smash – who is also a crew member from one of the doomed tanks – was located. Albert Price, , is now living in the West Midlands. It’s hoped he’ll be able to attend a  year commemoration of Operation Smash next year.

Lots of people were taken by surprise by the announcement that Harry and Meghans first child is due in spring , despite ongoing speculation since they tied the knot. This is all thanks to the very clever ways Meghan has hid her pregnancy from the world until the time was right to share the news. These are the clues that, in hindsight, could have given the game away.  Secret solo trip to Canada Meghan took a solo flight to Canada on the down-low in August to visit her best pal Jessica Mulroney - which could have been a sign that she had big news to share. According to Us Weekly , Meghan confided in Jessica when she visited her in Toronto this past August. With the benefit of hindsight, we now know this must have been around the time the baby was conceived, given that its due in the spring time. She may have been asking her best mate for tips - as Jessica has kids of her own.  Diversion tactics at Hamilton Everyone was wowed by Meghans long, slender legs that she showed off in a mini tuxedo dress when she arrived to see Hamilton in London in August. This may have been a clever way to take the focus off her tummy - although she wont have been showing too much at this point. She was incredibly careful not to reveal the news from a very early stage in her pregnancy.  Clever clutches At the Wellchild Awards in early September, Meghan wore a black suit with satin camisole and smartly kept her clutch close to her midrf to ensure she doesnt display any signs of an emerging bump. She also opted for black - which is an unusual choice for royals - but its also slimming.  Sleek up-dos Meghan has not been wearing her hair down in her signature waves as much recently - instead opting for a low messy bun. This could be because Meghan uses keratin smoothing treatments on her hair - which are not advised during pregnancy because some contain harsh chemicals like formaldehyde. We may see Meghanto her naturally curly locks through her pregnancy.  Billowing dresses Meghan looked amazing in a rather roomy Jason Wu dress for a gala concert in September - that left plenty of space for a blossoming baby bump. The billowing dress looked lovely on Meghan, and its perfect because there was no real way of ascertaining what the bump situation was - particularly when royal fans across the world have been eagerly awaiting the smallest sign.  Peplum tops Peplum tops are really the perfect choiceyou want to disguise a baby bump. The tops flare out in exactly the right places, and Meghan wore one to a sports demonstration at Loughborough University in late September.  Unbuttoned coat Just days before the happy news was announced, Meghans outfit at Princess Eugenie’s wedding should really have aroused more suspicion. Meghan wore an A-line singlebreasted coat by Givenchy that was left open across her tummy, with only two buttons done up. While keeping a coat on at an event is not unusual for royals, having it partially unbuttoned is not often seen.  Pointless folders Meghan arrived in Sydney for the start of the royal tour holding FOLDERS in front of her tummy . Youd think that the royals could easily get staff to help carry items like that, so it has all the signs of a last minute attempt to disguise her pregnancy before the official announcement took place.  Kensington Palace revealed Prince Harry and Meghans first child is due next spring, on the eve of their first overseas tour together. Meghan said of the pregnancy: Were ready.

Little Luke Vincent, five, rushed up to cuddle Meghan and Harry as the royal couple arrived in Dubbo, rural New South Wales. And the five-year-old, who has Down syndrome, stole the show as he left onlookers beaming and melted hearts as he playfully rubbed the princes beard.He also gave pregnant Meghan a beautul bunch of posies.The youngster told teachers his “favourite person” is Father Christmas.  Luke, a kindergarten pupil at Buningyong Public School, was transfixed by the Duke’s facial hair, according to the school’s Principal Anne Van Dartel. “He got a hug from Meghan and then Harry bent down to speak to him and Luke didn’t give him any choice!” she said. “Luke’s favourite person in the world is Santa Claus, who has a beard. And now his next favourite is Prince Harry. “It’s been a wonderful experience for these little country kids to meet people they’ve only ever seen on TV.” She said of the royal couple’s visit to Dubbo, whose farming community has been hit by a devastating drought in recent months, “This is a real morale boost.”  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex also dished out hugs for an excited welcoming party of  flag-waving local schoolchildren at the town’s airport. They spent around  minutes shaking hands, hugging youngsters and in Meghan’s case, accepting posies of flowers. James Fogg, , from Eumungerie Public School, which has just nine pupils, told Harry he wanted to be a helicopter pilot. “Good choice, good man,” the Duke replied. James said: “This is so exciting for Dubbo. It’s a once in a letime opportunity to meet them.” Five-year-old Lyra Rose, of Dubbo South Public School, said: “It’s the first time I have met a princess and I will remember it forever.”  School captain Mali Hopkins-Davies, , said: “Harry asked us when we had had rain. They seemed to know a lot about the drought.” Millie Sutclfe, , from Dubbo South Public School, hugged both royals. “My wish came true. I said congratulations on the baby and they thanked me. I said ‘I love you guys’ and I got a hug, she said. “They said ‘thank you for coming to meet us, you guys are awesome’.” Lachlan Eddy and Tyson Salt, both , from Dubbo West Public School, had Meghan in stitches as they performed some energetic dance moves.” “She said it was very funny,” said Lachlan.  They were greeted by youngsters aged from four to  - brought in from nine dferent schools - as they arrived on a Royal Australian Air Force flight into Dubbo, which is situated on the Macquarie River about km northwest of Sydney. They were met on the tarmac by regional mayor Councillor Ben Shields and Indigenous Elder Aubrey Grace Toomey. Also in the line up was Troy Grant MP, minister for police and emergency services, and his we Toni. Previous royal visitors to the town have included Edward, Prince of Wales in , the Queen in  and  and Prince Edward in . Meghan was wearing Aussie label Outlander jeans, shirt by Maison Kitsune, boots by J Crew, a jacket from the Serena Williams collection, and her necklace is Aussie label Natalie Martin.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"new eaterie chip 25 new","story":"NewsNew eaterie will chip in with  new jobs in PerthInvestment for the cityShareByDouglas Dickie:,  OCT NewsAlessandra Vareseat the Blue Lagoon in Ayr - this will soon be a familiar sight in Perth\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe opening of an iconic fish and chip restaurant in Perth city centre could create around  jobs for the city, the PA can reveal. Alessandro Varese, owner of the Blue Lagoon chippy, believes a proposed outlet on High Street will open up a number of job opportunities for residents. Planning permission for the shop was granted last month, with the new -seat restaurant set to open sometime in the spring. The project represents a pound, investment for the city centre. Mr Varese told the PA: “Trespass is due to move out in February and that’s when we will get the keys. “It will take six weeks to fit the shop out so we are looking at an opening date of April . That’s what we are aiming for. “Between the property and the cost of the fit, we are talking about an investment or three-quarters of a million pounds, so it is a big project for us. “This is the furthest north we have been and we are looking at employing around - local people.” The Blue Lagoon already has both takeaways and restaurants in Glasgow, as well as in places like Ayr, Largs and Stirling. The business was set up by Mr Varese’s grandfather over  years ago. In recent years, their Glasgow chip shops have become a favourite with celebrities, with the likes of Justin Bieber and Nigella Lawson enjoying its food. Mr Varese said the Perth restaurant, which will cover  square feet, will promise something dferent. He said: “It will be similar in size to out Stirling restaurant but the shop itself will be a bit dferent. We are adopting a Blue Lagoon beach theme with sand and palm trees.” Planning chiefs said the plan would bring “vitality and viability” to Perth city centre.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPerthshirePerthshire NewsPerthPerth NewsFoodJustin BieberNigella LawsonGlasgowStirlingAyrLargs"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September .

It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

and refurbishment works were required.Engineers arrived at Galafoot on August  to begin the scheduled  weeks of work.But by early September it emerged the scale of deterioration in both the concrete sections and steel reinforcements beneath the surface was much greater than initially anticipated.Amey announced that full night-time closures would be required to finish the deck repairs, waterproofing and resurfacing by the scheduled October .But with just over a week until the planned completion date they have extended the timescales through to November.And bosses have also announced that engineers willto complete the extensive repairs in February.Ameys bridges manager Stuart Wallace said: ldquoThese refurbishment works were originally intended to prevent the further deterioration of the bridge structure by repairing defects at an early stage.\"This work has subsequently uncovered several previously hidden defects that far exceeded expectations and this is the reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than continue with repairs to Galafoot over the festive period and into the new year, Amey has opted to finish on November  andthree months later.Mr Wallace added: ldquoThe local community has shown incredible patience and understanding with the repair programme to date.\"Having listened to their concerns, we consider it prudent to avoid further disruption over the busy holiday season.\"This strategy will also mitigate against the possible impact that winter weather might have on this workldquoOnce again, we want to thank road users, businesses and residents for their goodwill, and we will continue to consult with local stakeholders and provide updates on this scheme .Exact dates for the  works will be announced in the coming weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-of-buble-in-galashiels","story":"THE magic of

Ms Viguier and a team of Edinburgh stitchers crafted a complete replica of the Marian hangings which can be seen at Edinburgh Castle.The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh tapestry will take the form of a series of embroideries hung on velvet which, it is hoped, will find a permanent home at The Brunton in Musselburgh.The Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group has already secured pound, from the Musselburgh Common Good Fund, which will pay for the first phase of the tapestry.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

A major report from the UN intergovernmental  on climate change concluded that by  temperatures are on course to rise . degrees above pre-industrial levels, the maximum increase before catastrophic consequences ndash extreme floods and heat, mass displacement and poverty ndash are unleashed upon the planet.Wow. Twelve years. Letrsquos face it, unless yoursquore a teenager thatrsquos not long the sort of time frame two old friends could catch up on in an afternoon, a marriage that would be considered relatively short.And yet I didnrsquot honestly hear folk discussing, let alone panicking about, this perilous situation.

Despite how far we have evolved psychologically over the centuries, our ability to ignore serious issues because we donrsquot like the solutions remains remarkably strong.Living less mobile and connected lives, drastically reducing or giving up the conveniences that define our age ndash the dirty, gas-guzzling cars, the power-hungry gadgets, the cheap air travel, meat-heavy foods that fill our diets, the non-recyclable plastic ndash seems awful and impossible, so we ignore the whole thing.Even those of us already suffering the consequences of environmental destruction ndash those with breathing dficulties, for example ndash struggle to change their own behaviour because our brains are pre-conditioned to focus primarily on the short-term, and probably for very good reason.Human psychology has not evolved to point where it can handle the enormity of a challenge on this scale, evenscience can provide many of the intellectual and theoretical solutions. In other words, our tiny minds doom us to failure.And I include politicians in this ldquoour.

In doing so, he discovers new insights into how decisions were made about land far from Edinburgh and London.HIGHER LEARNINGMore than  years ago, the last Conservative Secretary of State to rule Scotland before devolution made one of the most important announcements about the future of the Highlands and Islands. The region, Michael Forsyth, said would get its own university. No longer would all students have to go south to learn after school.Mr Forsyth was speaking at a  meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee of MPs in Inverness. But he was not,- Mr Ross has discovered, saying things that Scotlandrsquos senior civil servants and all its established universities wanted to hear.Mr Ross wrote: ldquoI received a phone call from a Scottish Office civil servant after the meeting askingI had notes of what exactly Mr Forsyth had said onthe subject, as he and his colleagueshad no detail.ldquoWe later learnt Mr Forsyth had asked an opposition MP to ask a question about the university.For his book, Mr Ross went back to Mr Forsyth, now Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. ldquoOn the University of the Highlands and Islands, I just couldnrsquot get anywhere. The universities were all lobbying against it, the officials were against it. I could just see the whole thing disappearing into a three-year review. I thought we will just announce we are doing it, then they will have to get on with it. So thatrsquos what I did.David Ross on his Herald beatNow the institution has  colleges, with more than  local learning centres and thousands of students. The old Scottish Office as recently as  had described a campaign for a Highland university as ldquopremature and prejudicial.BRAVEHEART, CULLODEN AND THE TORIESHe was the Scottish secretary who ed the Stone of Destiny to Edinburgh. But, Mr Ross reveals, Lord Forsyth had another huge fight with civil servants over how to remember the last great battle on British soil and one of events which defined the Highlands of today: Culloden.In Highland Herald, Mr Ross describes how the then Mr Forsyth wanted to commemorate the battlersquos th anniversary in  as part of a civil war. But, the politician told Mr Ross, officials were ldquodesperate to keep it as low key as possible, because they thought it was sensitive.Lord Forsyth added: ldquoAnd I had to cope with the film Braveheart as well. It became apparent that people confused the Wars of Scottish Independence in the th Century with Culloden in the th Century, and had no understanding as to what this was all about.Mel GibsonThis was the era of high polling for Scottish independence and even higher support for a new parliament in Edinburgh, a body that was to materialise three years later.THE LAND QUESTIONConservatives may have been seen as the party of the lairds but Lord Forsyth told Mr Ross a dferent story. ldquoWe have had some horrendous examples of horrible landlords, he said, ldquomainly from outside Scotland.Community buy-outs became one of the biggest stories Mr Ross told about the Highlands over  years. In his book, he hears from a senior official that development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprisehad been initially dubious about supporting the Assynt Croftersrsquo historic and ultimately successful campaign to win their land  years ago.Andrew Thin, who was Chief Executive of Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise and today is Chairman of the Scottish Land Commission, recalls the early HIE approach was: ldquoQuiet moral support behind the scenes perhaps, but not a suitable use of public funds.However, an article in The Daily , he had been told, heralded an instruction from a high level in Whitehall that Assynt was exactly the sort of demonstration of local initiative and enterprise that should be supported.

As well as offering a home for nature, bogs play a key role in water quality and flow and in a healthy state, peat is an essential weapon in the fight against climate change, acting as a massive sink for greenhouse gases.But when damaged they can release huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Now a further , hectares of damaged peatlands are starting on the road to recovery after the pound million in extra funding from the Scottish Government for the national Peatland Action scheme.It will be spent on conservation measures including landscaping to reduce exposed peat and the installation of peat dams to restore water levels in blanket bogs, which are vital to carbon capture and provide habitats for many important Scottish species.Work will involve blocking gullies to prevent the earth from drying out and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.Eroded areas of bare peat will also be re-planted to stabilise the surface.These measures will improve mountain vegetation, which will in turn benefit native wildle and birds such as the snipe, skylark and greenshank.Andrew McBride, Project Manager of the Peatland ACTION project said: ldquoPeat covers over % of Scotlandrsquos land area and it is estimated that over % of this is in a degraded condition.\"The SNH Peatland ACTION team works with land managers across Scotland and in partnership with other organisations to restore degraded peatlands ndash to date we have started the process of restoration on nearly ,ha of peatlands.\"Most of our work involves advising on ditch blocking, stabilising eroded areas, and re-establishing vegetation ndash most notably by the bog building plant sphagnum moss.ldquoNot only are peatlands part of our landscape and cultural heritage, providing a unique habitat for species such as large heath butterflies and sundew plants, they are important for our environment. Peat stores carbon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\"Peatbogs retain and filter water, reducing the impact of drought or flooding and keeping our burns clean for fishing and drinking.Across the world, large-scale degradation is causing serious environmental and social impact, with annual emissions estimated at around two gigatonnes of carbon dioxide -  per cent of all global emissions.Rewetting damaged peatlands can bring them back to good condition.Scots are being urged to avoid using peat-based compost in their gardens to help preserve resources.Conservationists say the current reliance on the ancient material for growing certain plants is \"totally unacceptable and unsustainable\", and people should turn to alternatives that are just as effective and readily available.Nearly a quarter of Scotlands entire land area - around two million hectares - is made up of peat bogs, which are estimated to contain around , million tonnes of carbon.The habitat also plays a crucial role in helping guard against flooding, purying water and supporting rare native wildle such as adders, golden plovers, dragonflies and carnivorous sundew plants.Extraction of peat destroys peatlands, which take thousands of years to form - laying down just mm per year. Some of Scotlands mires began forming in the Bronze age.The UK government has committed to abolishing the use of peat in amateur gardening by  and ending extraction of peat for the horticulture industry by .However, despite a signicant rise in uptake of alternative composts, peat use by gardeners has also been increasing.Industry figures show more than half of material used in bagged composts is peat, amounting to two million cubic metres every year.Around a third of all peat used for gardening in the UK comes from bogs in this country, while the remainder comes from Ireland and where in Europe.Conservation charity Plantle, which owns Munsary nature reserve in the internationally recognised Flow Country in Caithness - one of Europes most extensive areas of peatland - is working with organisations such as the Royal Horticultural Society, the Scottish Wildle Trust and the National Trust for Scotland to end use of peat in gardening and revitalise peatlands.Plantles Dr Trevor Dines said: \"For the love of peat, the time to wean ourselves off this precious, threatened natural resource is now.\"Our use of peat is simply unsustainable, hugely damaging to our peatlands - some of our best natural treasures - and simply not relevant in todays climate.\"We all have the opportunity to do the right thing by our gardens and countryside and demand a peat-free future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-power-to-use-100-wind-power-after-selling-off-last-coal-and-gas-stations","story":"The Spanish-owned giant has become the first major UK energy supplier to refocus entirely on renewable sources such as wind and solar.Its move comes a week after the International Panel on Climate Changewarned the world was \"off track\" in efforts to limit environmentally catastrophic global warming.IPCC scientists warned \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" were required.Scottish Power on Tuesday said it had sold its remaining conventional electricity generation business to a subsidiary of Drax Group for poundm.And it said it would invest pound.bn in UK to more than double existing  gigawatt capacity for renewable energy over the next four years.Ignacio Galaacuten, Chairman and Chief Executive of Iberdrola, Scottish Powers parent, said: \"Energy companies must be part of the solution to climate change.\"Iberdrola is acting now to cut carbon emissions  per cent by  and be carbon neutral by .

These include the design of stealth drones advocated by defence companies such as BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin.The discovery, which confirms the common plant among the natural worldrsquos best fliers, shows movement of air around and within its ldquoparachute-shaped bundle of bristles often enables seeds to travel half a mile or more, kept afloat entirely by windpower.Gardeners generally dislike dandelions as they are viewed as weeds which have huge taproots that break easily when being removed.It can also regenerate from the tiniest piece to four times the size of what gardeners were trying to remove in the first place.The featherweight seeds carry on the lightest breeze and lodge themselves into every crack in the ground and every millimetre of bare soil.:Drone ban for children proposedDandelion pollen is not particularly nutritious, compared with that of clover and vetches, but it is available when little  is about.From March to November it offers a reliable source of food for all species of bees, beetles, butterflies and hoverflies.Now researchers from Edinburgh University have carried out experiments to understand why dandelion seeds fly so well, despite their parachute structure being largely made up of empty space.The findings show the seeds could be used in helping design under-the-radar technology such as drones for spy missions by the security services.The study revealed that a ring-shaped air bubble forms as air moves through the bristles.This enhances the drag that slows each seedrsquos descent to the ground.The newly found form of air bubble, which scientists have named the separated vortex ring, is physically detached from the bristles and stabilised by air flowing through it.Researchers found that the amount of air is critical for keeping the bubble stable and directly above the seed in flight, and is precisely controlled by the spacing of the bristles.The flight mechanism of the bristly parachute underpins the seedsrsquo steady flight and is four times more efficient than a conventional parachute.Scientists say the dandelionrsquos porous parachute may inspire the development of small-scale drones that require little or no power.Such drones could also be useful for remote sensing or air pollution monitoring.:New dandelion find on St Kilda#They hope their findings can be used to help engineering and sustainable technology fields.Dr Cathal Cummins, of the universityrsquos Schools of Biological Sciences and Engineering, who led the study, said: ldquoTaking a closer look at the ingenious structures in nature, like the dandelionrsquos parachute, can reveal novel insights.BAE Systems recently unveiled an aircraft design that is viewed as a major advance in stealth technology.The Magma drone does away with aircraft control surfaces, which has resulted in an aircraft whose shape remains constant throughout its flight.The small demonstration aircraft, which has completed a successful first flight, uses blown air to change direction instead of complex mechanical controls.Most aeroplanes look unmoving in flight, like a wing hanging off a giant tube flying through the sky.But conventional aircraft use a system of elevators, rudders and ailerons to control their direction in the pitch and roll directions.:Drone photography poses risk to wildle - expertsThese mechanical devices are usually in the shape of control surfaces attached to the rear of the wing, horizontal and vertical stabilisers and are controlled by the pilot ndash or sometimes an onboard flight computer.Control surfaces have been an instrumental part of aircraft since the early th century. These mechanisms can and do fail, limiting an aeroplanersquos manoeuvrability.But among a new generation of stealth warplanes, control surfaces can also affect an airplanersquos carefully shaped stealth profile, as the fin-like device moves upward or downward, momentarily making the aircraft slightly more visible to radar.Now the Edinburgh University researchers are hopeful that the dandelion seeds can help advance the technology further.The study, published in science journal Nature, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Royal Society."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-a-smacking-ban-would-truly-make-us-a-civilised-nation","story":"So why would it be any dferent for a child  When parents chastise their children with a smack or a slap, it is far worse than hitting an adult.

It will be a historic day, a signal that we are among the most civilised of nations, committed to caring for those who canrsquot protect themselves.When you look at the levels of anger and violence in our own society, let alone the world, this change of culture canrsquot come soon enough. Yet the prospect of the ban has caused protests. Less than a thirdof respondents to a survey support it, and more than halfbelieve smacking should still be allowed.Their main worry, it seems, is not the welfare of children but the potential for so-called respectable adults to be criminalised for raising their offspring as they see fit. For some, as for their own parents and countless generations before them, teaching right from wrong involves tough love. How  can a toddler be prevented from running into the road  Surely a short, sharp lesson will make the point and potentially save their lives Well, perhaps. But to judge by the number of times Irsquove watched little ones yanked by the arm, thumped on the bottom or the back of the legs and even on one occasion slapped hard on the face ndash all without modying their behaviour ndash it would seem the message isnrsquot getting through. Pain and humiliation do not result in obedience and docility. When used too often, or fiercely, smacking causes resentment, rebellion and fear. A woman thwacking her spaniel to bring it to heel would be universally viewed with horror. Some might even dare to remonstrate. But when itrsquos a child, we are schooled to walk on, since itrsquos none of our business.In previous ages, when people were less educated, families large and money tight, physical punishment was deemed perfectly acceptable. Now, however, it looks uncomfortably like brutality. Since time immemorial the British attitude to children has been punitive, telling them to keep quiet, and allowing them to become the butt of unfeeling or sadistic schoolteachers as well as parents. Yet a teacher today who clipped a pupil over the ear or brought a ruler down on the back of their hands would be queuing up at the JobCentre before nightfall. Such acts were outlawed decades ago. By introducing a smacking ban, government will thus be calling time on the harsh treatment inflicted on children at home, where privacy no longer hides them from the reach of the law.Most parents will admit that smacking is not a sign that they are in charge, but that they have lost control. The signal it sends to youngsters is that aggression is a normal response to a situation. To the old argument that ldquoit never did me any harm, take a look at the levels of depression, addiction and anxiety around us. Coming under physical attack from the people who love you most is deeply and sometimes permanently scarring. It can lead to self-harming, to abusive relationships in adulthood and, since they have experienced it from infancy, to lashing out when under duress.Itrsquos half a century since Bob Dylan wrote his prophetic song in which he tells mothers and fathers: ldquoYour sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is Rapidly aginrsquo. Please get out of the new one If you canrsquot lend your hand  For the times they are a-changinrsquo.They are indeed changing, and for the better. Rethinking how to educate and control children requires time, effort, and bottomless reserves of patience and self-restraint. It involves talking to youngsters, and reasoning with them, once they are old enough to understand, and drawing lines beyond which there will be consequences ndash but none of them violent.I know several young mums with demanding families, one with four boys below eight. She and her husband have acquired the sort of negotiating skills that could win us a brilliant Brexit deal. Explaining, being firm but kind, finding distractions, and never losing it are the new rules. Indeed,countries and international diplomacy were run on the same principles the world, like our children, would be in a better and happier place."},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie saved from a96 dual plans","story":"The option to create a dual carriageway through the Bennachie area has been scrapped by the Scottish Government.It has been removed following initial design and assessment work, and also feedback from the public.Initial options removed include the existing A Inverurie Bypass and the offline southern route between east of Huntly and Blackburn, which passes through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area.Local communities and road users in the Inverurie area have the chance to see and comment on the options being taken forward for further design as the Scottish government looks to identy a preferred route option next year.Public exhibitions will be held at Inverurie Town Hall todayand tomorrow , and residents in Huntly will get to have their say on Wednesdayat Stewarts Hall.

This includes those near Bennachie and those through Inverurie on the existing A.”The removal of the plan to upgrade the A through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area has been welcomed by Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin.Last month, Ms Martin welcomed campaigners from the Save Bennachie group to meet with new Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to discuss their concerns.The group also previously met with then Economy Minister Keith Brown earlier this year to discuss their opposition to the plans.Ms Martin MSP said: “I am thrilled Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has confirmed the route passing Bennachie has now been dropped.“The Save Bennachie group have tirelessly campaigned and shown true passion and dedication for their cause.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of the Kemnay Academy Rock Challenge Team accept the donation from Lynn Murphy of Tesco\"  Bags of Help cash for pupils viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“I commend them all for a campaign which has been time-consuming and, those who were a part of it, for their commitment and determination.“They managed to achieve cross-party support and I know MSPs from all parties shared a collective admiration for them.“I would like to thank the Transport Minister and Transport Scotland for all their work to date and for taking the time to meet with myself, other MSPs and the Save Bennachie team to listen to their views.

Sands helpline operates from .am to .pm Monday to Friday and pm to pm Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Sands is leading a coalition of more than  charities working to prevent baby deaths and pregnancy loss. Jointly, they are urging all NHS Trusts and Boards to improve bereavement care for parents across the UK.The call comes during Baby Loss Awareness Week, which runs from October  to October .The week also marks the roll-out of the National Bereavement Care Pathway , a partnership between the charities, governments and the NHS.The pathway sets out standards for providing excellent care to anyone affected by pregnancy and baby loss.This year is also Sands’ th anniversary, providing support to parents who have suffered a bereavement.While there have been many improvements since , unfortunately, inconsistencies still remain across the UK.Marc Harder, the NBCP project lead for Sands, said: “Standards of care across the country right now are very much inconsistent.“We want those in power to ensure that bereaved parents get the best possible care, wherever they live and wherever they present themselves – whether that be AE, a maternity unit or early pregnancy unit.“Sadly, health care professionals don’t always have the training they need to speak to bereaved parents.“In an audit we carried out last year, only  per cent of Trusts with maternity units provided mandatory bereavement training.“And of those  per cent,  per cent of them only provided their staff with one hour or less of bereavement training each year.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local politicians have responded to Kirkcaldy Foodbanks urgent plea for help.

Marc added: “In the next  months, we have the opportunity to really make a dference in Scotland.“We have come a long, long way since  but we’ve still got a way to go.“We long for a world in which there is no baby loss. “Until then we’ll continue to work to ensure parents receive the best possible care they can during their bereavement journey.”Scottish Government funding lays pathway to improvementsIn April this year, the National Bereavement Care Pathwayfor pregnancy and baby loss was extended to Scotland, thanks to £, in funding from the Scottish Government. Sands is working with the Scottish Government, a number of baby loss charities and other health care partners in Scotland to develop the approach over the next two years, with the plan to pilot, implement and embed the NBCP across Scotland by March .Five experiences of pregnancy or baby loss are included in the NBCP including miscarriage, termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death and the sudden unexpected death of an infant up to the age of  months.Health Secretary Shona Robison said: “The funding will allow implementation of the National Bereavement Care Pathway in pilot sites across Scotland and ensure all bereaved parents are offered high quality, sensitive bereavement care.”The development of the NBCP in Scotland is being overseen by a Scottish steering group.Kate Mulley, director of research, education and policy at Sands, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support of the Scottish Government and Sands support groups in Scotland who have contributed to the funding of this vital project which will make such a dference to so many families.” Forty years ago, two bereaved mothers, Bel Mooney and Hazelanne Lewis, found there was no support available. So they founded Sands in .At that time, most parents were not allowed to see, hold or bury their babies and they could not put their babies’ names on the stillbirth certicate.Sands is now the leading stillbirth and neonatal death charity in the UK. It works to reduce baby deaths through promoting better maternity care and funding research. The charity offers training and comprehensive bereavement support, both nationally through its helpline –    or via email at helpline@sands.org.uk – and locally via some  regional support groups.Further information can be found at www.sands.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie makes most beautiful shortlist","story":"Inverurie has been shortlisted for Scotland#s Most Beautul High Street competition run by Scotland#s Towns Partnership , Keep Scotland Beautul, and the Herald on Sunday.The STP seeks to celebrate towns, cities and villages that take pride in where they live, and highlight the groups who come together and work to change their communities for the better: making local places clean, attractive, accessible, sustainable, vibrant and inclusive for all to enjoy.Entries will be judged on factors including horticultural achievement, public realm, environmental responsibility, community participation and accessibility and inclusivity.Inverurie Environmental ImprovementGroup chairman, John Glover, said: “IEI is delighted that Inverurie Town Centre has been shortlisted for Scotland’s Most Beautul High Street.\"The Town Centre has looked exceptionally well with the floral displays this year.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting. Unfortunately, Highland Council appears not to have.\"As a result, I have written to them to ask them to give further consideration to this approach, especially when the committee has heard how well this works in other areas.\"She added: \"While the Highland Council representative did note that there was engagement with the third sector, communities and citizen  for budgeting in the past, I am concerned that engagement, dialogue and meaningful consultation did not happen in the run-up to the budget process for this financial year.\"Im concerned that we are now close to the budget being presented to council and meaningful engagement has still not taken place.\"Highland Council plans to close  of its  public toilets to save pound, a year but opponents claim the move could lead to a visitor boycott.Campaigners delivered a ,-signature petition to Highland Council last month and claimed the proposal has already impacted the tourism sector.

A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed.

Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical. Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"11 greenwell gott ","story":"Offers over £,This exclusive development comprises thirteen houses grouped around a large communal park which provides a great play area for children being on a no-through road.

However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/STROMEFERRY-ROAD-TO-RAIL-4.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8670219.1539681264!/image/image.jpg","title":"airport hosts jobs fair","story":"Nine companies have more than  new jobs on offer at a major airport Jobs Fair set to be held this week in the Templeton Hotel, Templepatrick.The job fair will be held on Wednesday, October  and gets underway at pm and lasts until pm.

I was booked into try their Interstellar Relaxation Experience with the package tailored to leave the senses ‘other worldly’.A warm welcome was extended at the spa entrance as my battered Converse were taken away to be swtly replaced with a cosy pair of slippers. After changing I met with my therapist for the afternoon, Leanne, who explained that the experience would entail a pressure point foot massage, hot stone back, neck and shoulder massage, regenerating jasmine infused facial with warming Space Mask and to finish a chance to sip over a glass of flora jasmine tea.Having an almost -month- year-old son, bag, baggage, pram, and the everyday ‘essentials’ to cover that role, my back and shoulders were in dire need of a serious overhaul and I was more than happy to let Leanne knead, massage and crack away at the numerous knots accumulated over the past two years.Having chose a detoxying body oil for the duration of the treatment, Leanne explained that the ingredients would still be working their magic  hours after, so Monday could be faced head on. Combining the very finest in the Spa’s renowned ESPA range, Leanne used the Optimal Skin Procleanser which acts as a cleaner, exfoliator and mask for visibly radiant skin, hydrating cleansing milk and from their age-defying range – which I was all for – the Tri-Active Advanced Instant Facial with the Regenerating Face Treatment Oil and Lt and Firm Mask. The treatment was further complimented with a pressure point foot massage and application of the very latest in beauty utopia, the self heating Spacemask, which works to relieve tiredness, eye strain and many other ‘earthly tensions’.ESPA’s Pink Hair and Scalp Mask was then applied to enhance the Tibetan scalp massage.

Brexit showdown: Big risksDUP removes its influence at Westminster  Why are Fosters pro-Remain critics never called out for not believing Brussels either   Boris Johnson’s father slammed for ‘Irish will shoot each other’ slur on daytime TV In London, Mrs May has had hardline Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party threatening to force a no confidence vote in her leadershipministers didnt persuade her to drop her Chequers Brexit plan.And in Belfast, DUP leader Arlene Foster, who has also been under pressure on other issues, dismissed suggestions that she didnt enjoy the confidence of her party.Mrs May will address the other  EU national leaders at a summit before they sit down to dinner without her.Officials said they expected the EU leaders to tell her they have little more to offer since talks stalled on Sunday and they will step up preparations for Britain to drop out of the bloc with no deal.The EU leaders will decide at dinner on whether to firm up a tentative plan to hold a special Brexit summit in mid-November.But Mr Tusk said they would need to believe that a deal was nearly done - and without some new move from Mrs May today, that belief seems unlikely to come this week.The key sticking point is the so-called backstop to avoid a hard border in Ireland even in the case of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.Last night Mr Tusk warned that the risk of a \"no deal\" dumping Britain out of the bloc and into legal limbo and border chaos on March  was now greater than ever. He put the onus on Mrs May to bring a \"creative\" solution to break the impasse over the border and said she needed to put forward \"concrete proposals\"she wanted to avoid no deal.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said more time is needed to reach an agreement.The BBC reported that Mrs May told a Cabinet meeting yesterday that she cant agree to any deal that would create a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. She also said she couldnt accept an agreement that locked the UK into some form of customs union with the EU indefinitely.Downing Street told the BBC that none of the ministers threatened to quit at the Cabinet meeting yesterday and insisted Mrs May had strong support.Mrs May also faces the challenge of securing a deal that placates the DUP whose support she relies on to make up the numbers in the House of Commons. The DUP is vehemently opposed to any backstop that would see Northern Ireland treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Asked by the BBCshe and the party could trust the Prime Minister, DUP leader Arlene Foster said they just wanted a \"sensible\" Brexit deal.\"Its not a case of trust. Its a case of elucidating what our position is,\" she said.\"I firmly believe Theresa May is a unionist and her instincts are very good in relation of the Union. All we are saying is she should listen to her instincts and not be pulled away from those instincts.\"The Fermanagh MLA was askedher party would vote for the budget at the end of the month. She said the situation was \"very fluid\" adding: \"We shouldnt jump ahead of ourselves. We are waiting to see the text that comes forward.\"There has also been rumours of a potential challenge to Mrs Fosters leadership. However, the former First Minister dismissed those reports, saying she was \"confident\" of the support of her party. \"There is no truth in that,\" she said.Speaking in the Dail ahead of his departure for Brussels, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the gaps between the UK and EU positions are \"signicant\" and time is running out for a Brexit deal to be in place by the time the UK leaves at the end of next March.Mr Varadkar insisted that he still believes a \"positive outcome\" is possible and that a no-deal scenario is \"unlikely\".But he also said the Irish Government has been stepping up preparations for that possibility.And following talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney made clear that Dublin would not accept a time-limited backstop. Mr Coveney said: \"We cannot sign up to - and I dont believe Michel Barnier would ever ask European countries to sign up to - a backstop for Ireland that isnt there unless and until something better is agreed.\"If you set a date in the future when a backstop falls, then it is not a backstop at all, unless something is there to replace it which has been negotiated and agreed.\"Asked whether he expected a special Brexit summit to be called for November, the Tanaiste said: \"I expect what will be needed is an acceptance that more time is needed for negotiating teams to re-engage.\"I think there is going to have to be a signal from the negotiating teams that a new summit is necessary before it will be called.\"Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann MLA yesterday rejected comments by the Taoiseach, who was reported to have told Virgin Media: \"Whats on the table now is a special status for Northern Ireland which could be an advantageous position\".Mr Swann said: \"Despite numerous meetings with his government, despite the principle of consent being embedded at the heart of the Belfast Agreement and despite my colleagues and I cautioning them to be mindful of the rhetoric they use, it is clear that the Irish Government see these Brexit negotiations as an opportunity to attempt to weaken or change Northern Irelands current status as an integral part of the United Kingdom.\"His comments will be interpreted by unionists as an attack on the sovereignty of Northern Ireland.\"In the Dail, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald TD said Mrs Mays time limited backstop \"means, in reality, no backstop at all\". \"I met with the British Prime Minister yesterday and put that to her bluntly,\" she said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic updates latest disruption and delays on the roads","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

It aims to develop positive relationships between people of dferent community backgrounds, and to enhance skills to help participants contribute to improving the attitudes of people within their local areas.Through a series of interactive workshops, community leaders will explore the Holocaust, how it happened, why it happened and how the lessons learned from it can be used to address key issues in today’s society – including sectarianism, racism and the refugee crisis. It is hoped that the programme will equip community leaders with the tools to challenge prejudice, bigotry and intolerance in their own communities and in doing so become champions of Local Community Planning. This programme will also provide an excellent opportunity to critically evaluate one of the most horric events of the th century and to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive.The programme incorporates two elements: training sessions and a study visit which will take a total of  days.Training Days: Tuesday th November Tuesday th Novembergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh Tuesday th November Wednesday th January Study Trip: Thursday th January – Sunday th January  Final Day: Date to be agreed with participating groupParticipants are required to take part in the entire Challenging Prejudice Leadership Development Programme and have a valid passport for travel in order to be considered.There are currently  places available.

campaign","story":"A Derry project aimed at helping young people with disabilities to form friendships and explore social opportunities is currently the star of UK wide advertising campaign for a high profile charity.The ‘Bud Club’ at the Play Trail features in the BBC Children in Need advert which has been played in cinemas and in prime time TV slots.The  second clip took  hours to shoot and features Bud Club members enjoying themselves and developing their social and communication skills.Gavin Melly, Inclusion Officer at the Play Trail, said the club was established five years ago to help young people with disabilities to enjoy a social le.The club, which is based in Northside Shopping Centre, meets twice a week and focuses on the personal development of its members.“Young people with disabilities are at a greater risk of social exclusion, marginalisation and isolation because they feel they are not being listened to, have no friends, no social le, find it dficult to do things other young people their own age participate in such as, shopping, going to the bowling alley, cinema and attending local youth clubs,” explained Mr Melly.The  members all have dferent needs but they all share the same desire to socialise like other young people.“Bud Club members needs range from wheelchair users, to young people with autism, young people with a learning and physical disabilities, young people with no verbal communication, young people with visual impairments and young people with complex medical needs,” said Mr Melly.“These young people with disabilities are made feel they have no contribution to make, and may feel unsafe, bullied, harassed and excluded and have limited choice of services and are not being involved in decision making relating to their own needs.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe Bud Club is user led and plans its activities I response to the needs of its members.“Whatever they come up with we will do,” said Mr Melly.“We want to provide these young people with the same opportunities as any other young person.“When the club started we asked the young people about their lives they said we go to school on a yellow bus and come home on a yellow bus and that is it.”“In some cases their parents’ fears become a barrier to leaving them with someone .Having little or no social interaction with young people without disabilities within a youth work setting also isolates a lot of young people with disabilities from mainstream services.So the Bud Club works to alleviate this helping its members get the support they need to attend mainstream youth groups.“It’s all about choice and fostering positive experiences,” added Mr Melly."},{"url":null,"title":"derrys newest director set unveil hilarious debut show","story":"A young Derry woman has achieved her dream of opening a performing arts college and is set to stage her first production next month.Former Lumen Christi College pupil Cheryl McEvoy recently graduated from Londons prestigious Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, where she discovered a love of directing.After moving back to her home town of Derry earlier this year she wasted no time in establishing The Chorus Academy of Performing Arts in the Milltown Business Park, just over the border in Buncrana.Before leaving for London Cheryl studied at the NWRC and it was here she discovered how many talented performers there are in the area, which influenced her decision to open a performing arts academy.\"There is talent in Derry that we could use instead of having to bring people over from England for productions” she said.“Some of the people I knew at the college are better than those in the West End.”And next month her academy will put on its first Musical ‘The Addams Family’ starring a host of North West talent, including  year-old Lauryn Mullholland as Morticia Addams.Lauryn, who also studies at The Chorus Academy of Performing Arts said: “Ive taken part in musicals from as young as  years old in Buncrana and Derry, being cast as Annie in \"Annie\" for Derrys City of Culture .“I have been singing and performing in productions such as \"Joseph and his Technicolour coat\" Tour, Londonderry Musical Society and YouthForum for years.“I have since proudly become a part of the Chorus Academy of Performing Arts for its first year and I am so excited to work with them for this upcoming production of \"The Addams Family\".“Cheryl is an amazing director and I can’t wait to be a part of Cheryl’s vision coming to le on stage.’During her time at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama Cheryl discovered a love for teaching and directing.\"I fell in love with theatre, but its not necessarily musical theatre, jazz hands or the West End which most people would think of,\" she said.googletag.cmd.push

acting thing now and I really enjoy the directing side of it.”And she cannot wait to see her first musical on the stage.“We do showcases every term but this is the first major production.“I aim to have the kids in the academy performing as much as possible so when it comes to doing a feis or an audition they are used to it.“You gain confidence from each performance I always think performing in front of people you know is that hardest thing.”The cast range from aged three to  and Cheryl says they give some great comedic performances.“It’s shaping up to be a great show,” she said. “It’s very funny and there are some great songs.“I had seen the script before but when I heard it in rehearsals I was just laughing my head off.“There’s such a dference between reading something and hearing it aloud with the actors’ own spin on it.”‘The Addams Family’ will take place on November  and , The Plaza Ballroom, Buncrana, tickets are available at www.chorusapa.eventbrite at  Euro and  Euro

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country.

He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure. Neither could be further from the truth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Rockmount golfers rule in Rafferty Cup  ","story":"ROCKMOUNT Golf Club were crowned Ronan Rafferty champions for the second time in  years at the weekend.The local lads faced formidable opposition in the form of Killymoon Golf Club, and the standard of golf during both legs of the final was outstanding.Rockmountrsquos classy juniors held their nerve to get their hands on the trophy and team captains Stuart Thompson and Gareth Poole were more than delighted at the clubrsquos success.ldquoWe were impressed by the standard of golf and professionalism shown by the squad throughout the tournament, and especially in the final where the team were pushed to the very end to get the win over the line, Stuart said.This win came on the back of a successful season for the young men and women of Rockmount, which included the semi-finals of the Fred Daly Plate and the Norman Drew competitions.They also reached the final of the Johnny Dickson, and a young and inexperienced team finished second in the Eddie Harper Cup.With a strategy in place at Rockmount to bring the young blood through the ranks of the club, the future is looking bright..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Try fest as ‘Hinch oust Randalstown  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH U-s continued their fine early season form with an eight-try performance at home to an understrength Randalstown outfit.Despite being without some front line backs, the boys put on an excellent display on a great day for running rugby.They were a little flat early in the match, but settled down after ten minutes and began producing some of the patterns they have been working hard on in training.Winger Mark McAleenan opened the scoring after great work from number  Morgan Croskery and as the lsquoHinch pack began to dominate further scores from Croskery and hooker Kai Shields stretched the lead.The game was effectively over when lsquoHinch scored an excellent team try just before half-time.Prop Shaun Lin made  metres from inside his own half and from a quick ruck blindside flanker Matthew Torney carried hard from first receiver to punch another hole in the Randalstown defence. Out half Caleb Maguire then spread the ball wide and the flying McAleenan scorched in for the score.lsquoHinch emptied the bench at half-time and Randalstown had much more of the play in the second half, but further scores from the impressive centre Cameron Lyons, lock Matthew Reynolds and the hard-working Torney put the result beyond doubt.Randalstown mounted a sustained late assault on the lsquoHinch line late in the second half as they searched for a consolation score, but to their credit, the home side dug in to protect their line and drove upfield to earn a succession of close range scrums.Lyons brought up the half century with his second try after an excellent angled run and flat pass from Croskery, who also kicked six conversions in a fine display.Ballynahinch will be pleased to follow up their victory over Instonians with another strong leagueperformance and there is a great spirit in the squad with plenty of competition for places.They will need to be on their game for the next League match away to Carrickfergus on October .Ballynahinch U- Randalstown U- U- LEAGUE EAST.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8774383.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

former head of the NI Civil Service, Jackie Henry, senior partner at Deloitte NI and Richard Moore, senior manager in consulting at Deloitte NI, at the launch of the State of State report Welcomed as a novel that will “help people think about Me Too”, it has also been praised for a unique first-person voice rich in the conversational language of Northern Ireland and its handling of universal problems facing women and outsiders.Judges have said they did not consider the current prominence of Northern Ireland or the gender equality debate in their deliberations, nor was the accessibility of the book to average readers “on the Tube”.Milkman has been hailed as a book that “will last” by the chairman of the  of judges, philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, who said the novel was as useful for thinking about fractured societies in Lebanon and Syria as it was for the current gender debate in the West.The chairman said he was “resigned” to the novel being linked to the Me Too movement, but said the work was more universal.Appiah said at a ceremony at the Guildhall in London: “It speaks to the future. I think it’s going to last.“I think this will help people to think about Me Too. It’s not just about something that is going on in this moment.“This is about the way in which men and women put pressure on a young girl to do things sexually that she doesn’t want to do. It had to do with a masculine environment.“This is particular, but it’s brilliantly universal.

I asked Wesley to send this through as proof that briefings and meetings were taking place. He is content for us to use this info.”Mr Aston yesterday insisted to the RHI Inquiry that the UFU’s relationship with Dr Crawford was no dferent to that which it had with other Spads, even though he was a former UFU colleague.Mr Aston told the inquiry that he had met Dr Crawford and had a “brief conversation” and he sent the emails “just on the basis of [it being] purely factual information, not knowing what was going to be subsequently done with those”.He said that Dr Crawford gave him no indication of how he was going to use the documentation and Mr Aston said he was not suspicious of what was going on even when the emails led to this newspaper asking awkward questions of the UFU.Inquiry barrister Donal Lunny put it to Mr Aston that there was evidence of Dr Crawford providing information to the UFU which gave it an advantage at earlier points and now it seemed that the UFU was helping him and the DUP. Mr Aston said it was “purely factual” and he would have done the same for any other Spad. But, when pressedhe had similar exchanges with any other Spad, Mr Aston said he had not done so on such a serious issue.Mr Lunny asked him whether he could see that with so much focus on the DUP, the documents he was providing “might be used to sht some of the focus on to the officials”.Mr Aston repeated that it was “purely factual”. When pressed on the issue again, he said he was surprised Dr Crawford could not access the emails within Stormont.Mr Lunny said that “emails of this type were ultimately leaked to a number of journalists”. and Anna Burns on stage at the Guildhall in London after she was awarded the Man Booker Prize for Fiction for her novel Milkman.

When pressed several times to answer the question, Mr Aston said he regretted “the outcome from that delay” but it wasn’t solely responsible for that.Mr Lunny askedhe had asked Dr Crawford whether it was him who had leaked the emails “because they are at least some of the emails that were forwarded to him on January ”. Mr Aston said: “No, I didn’t at that stage.”Mr Lunny asked: “Would that not be a natural thing to ask – these are the emails that we sent you six weeks ago did you leak them to the News Letter ”Mr Aston said: “It may have been obvious now, but at the time, no.”try catch     .               ..

Prime Minister Theresa May The meeting is the occasion when the leaders of the remaining  member states were supposed to give the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britain’s withdrawal.But after hastily arranged talks between the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab broke up on Sunday without agreement, the negotiations are once again deadlocked.European Council president Donald Tusk has warned that without new “concrete proposals” from the British to break the logjam over the so-called Irish border “backstop”, further progress may be impossible.However, with her party split - and some Tory MPs openly calling for her to go - Mrs May has little room to manoeuvreshe is to secure a deal which stands any chance of getting through Parliament.Ahead of her visit to Brussels, Mrs May was able to secure the backing of her Cabinet - at least for now - amid reports that some Brexiteer ministers were prepared to quitshe gave too much ground to Brussels.During a marathon three-hour meeting on Tuesday, she insisted she would not accept an agreement on the backstop - intended to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - which undermined the integrity of the UK or tied it indefinitely to EU customs arrangements.However, there was anger among Tory Brexiteers after The Dailyreported that Chancellor Philip Hammond warned the meeting that the UK could still have to pay the EU up to £ billion of the £ billion “orce bill” to settle its outstanding liabilities, in the event of a no-deal break.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, meanwhile, said ministers needed to stand “four square” behind the Prime Minister and warned attacks by Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson risked derailing Brexit altogether.“What I would say to Boris is be careful because there is a real danger thatall of us Conservative MPs do not stand behind the Prime Minister at a moment like this, the danger is that Brexit will be derailed altogether,” he told the Daily Mail.“I am sure that this is the last thing Boris wants.”The Prime Minister will briefly address the leaders of the EU  on Wednesday evening before they discuss the state of play in the Brexit negotiations over a working dinner while she leaves.RHI Inquiry: Weeks before leak to News Letter, UFU boss sent emails to DUP Spad Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Her official spokesman said she would take the opportunity to set out the areas where progress had been achieved while stressing her commitment to finding an agreement.“We want to secure a deal as quickly as possible. We think it is in the best interests of the UK and European Union to forge that deep future partnership,” the spokesman said.With hopes of a November summit fading, focus has turned to the next scheduled meeting of the European Council in December as the last chance to secure a deal and get it ratied by the UK and European parliaments before Britain leaves in March .Mr Barnier told a meeting of EU  foreign ministers in Luxembourg that “more time” was needed to find an agreement to deliver an orderly UK withdrawal and resolve the Irish border issue.“We will take this time, calmly and seriously, to find this global agreement in the next weeks,” he said.Some Tory Brexiteers, however, believe the Prime Minister has deliberately pushed back the negotiations to the last possible moment to pressurise MPs into backing her plan rather than see the UK “crash out” without an agreement.try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It consists of three workshops: Creating a Winning Mind Winning in Communication and Winning in Business.It also includes a practical component participants must organise and produce a fundraiser event in their pub for a charity of their choice. To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
