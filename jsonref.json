Unlike crude oil and petroleum, natural gas must be transported through pipelines, and it could take Europe years to build the infrastructure needed to get proper supplies of natural gas from other places. Many liquified natural gas terminals that receive deliveries from the U.S. and Qatar are already maxed out. How much are Russian fuel sales financing the war?  Russia is taking in a whopping $1 billion per day for the oil and gas products it sells to the West each day. It currently sells around 5 million barrels of oil every day, where prices are increasing rapidly. Total revenues for crude oil and refined products amount to about $700 million per day. Where could the U.S. get its oil without Russia? Republicans have for weeks called on the Biden administration to encourage more more oil production within the U.S.  In 2019 the U.S. was the largest crude oil producer in the world, pumping out 13 million barrels per day. Now the nations pumps about 11.5 million barrels per day. And while the U.S. imports crude oil from around the world, it is still exporting millions of barrels per day. \u0027Perhaps we would export a little less oil and hold onto the oil,\u0027 proffered Snape. But one hindrance on keeping oil at home is the 1920 Jones Act. The protectionist law says that ships carrying goods between U.S. ports must be built, crewed and owned by Americans, putting US-made products at a disadvantage against foreign competitors which can use market-rate shipping. The U.S. could also turn to Canada or Latin America to pump up exports. Over the weekend the Biden administration sent a delegation to Venezuela, a close ally of Russia, to meet with the Maduro administration, seeking to rebuild diplomatic relations and plead for more oil. Schork called the idea that Venezuela could pump more oil \u0027a joke,\u0027 and said the Biden administration should focus on being less hostile to domestic production. \u0027The Venezuelan oil industry is a shell of itself due to 20 years of Hugo Chavez’s socialism. Even if Venezuelan production was up, Maduro is in bed with Putin. So we are going to Iran which is a state sponsor of terrorism. We’d rather negotiate with terrorists than Texans.\u0027 Sen. Marco Rubio agreed, writing on Twitter: \u0027Joe Biden using #Russia as an excuse to do the deal they always wanted to do anyway with the #MaduroRegime... Rather than produce more American oil he wants to replace the oil we buy from one murderous dictator with oil from another murderous dictator.\u0027 The U.S. is also nearing agreement on a new nuclear deal with Iran that could lift sanctions and return Iranian oil to market. Biden is also reportedly eyeing up a trip to Saudi Arabia after OPEC nations have for months rebuffed his requests to pump more oil. Biden during the campaign trail promised to make Saudi Arabia a \u0027pariah\u0027 and blamed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The U.S.\u0027s Strategic Petroleum Reserve held 588 million barrels as of the end of January, according to the Energy Department, and Biden last week released 30 million barrels from the reserve in an agreement with European countries that together would release a total of 60 million barrels.    adverts.addToArray({pos:mpu_factbox})Advertisement"},{"url":null,"title":"Stranded Russian troops face dying tanks 40 ton iron freezers 20C cold snap","story":"Share this articleRUSSIA-UKRAINE LIVE: Scotland v Ukraine postponed, and why \u0027Z\u0027 is used for pro-Russian propaganda | Daily Mail OnlineRussian Offensive Campaign Assessment, March 7 | Institute for the Study of War"},{"url":null,"title":"Sprung Adorable moment playful pup caught cuddling cat South Australia Bordertown","story":"Share this article The playful black pup immediately leaped away after spotting his owner.The cat was a bit slower to react, ing after the pup in the last few moments of the clip. In the video Jacob looked just as confused as the little cat as to why the puppy was so quick to jump away from its playmate. "},{"url":null,"title":"David Lammy not embarrassed past praise John Bercow","story":"Share this article \u0027He was very good on issues of equalities, race.

Fitch has downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to its second lowest level, down six notches to C. That’s just one step above borrowers who have defaulted. Fitch said that developments since it last downgraded Russia on March 2nd had further undermined the country’s willingness to service government debt. It points to President Vladimir Putin’s decree last week that Russian creditors can use roubles to pay some foreign currency debts, and the country’s central bank’s restriction of some rouble-denominated debt coupon transfers. The intensifying sanctions could also lead Moscow to default on its obligations, Fitch says: The statement comes after the US and UK said they will ban Russian oil, as the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine continued to ratchet up. Russia is due to make its next debt repayment on March 16 -- though it would have a 30-day grace period to meet the coupon payments. Western sanctions, including a ban on Russia’s central bank from accessing foreign currency reserves, have preventing Putin from accessing much of the $630bn war chest built up in foreign currencies before the invasion. Yesterday, a flurry of major Western countries suspended business in Russia, with Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and McDonald’s joining the pullout following the Ukraine war. Shell announced plans to withdraw from Russian oil and gas and Unilever has said it will stop importing and exporting its products with Russia:  The aircraft was detained on the orders of the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, late on Tuesday and investigators are looking into its connection with a billionaire oil tycoon, Eugene Shvidler (as flagged here), a friend of Roman Abramovich. A UK government source said Shvidler was “free to continue his journey by other means” after the plane was impounded. They said the plane would be able to leave Farnborough only if no link with Russia was established, and the process was likely to take longer than a day. Kentucky-based Yum! Brands is suspending 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and finalising an agreement to suspend all 50 Pizza Hut outlets in partnership with its master franchisee.  Yum! has 1,000 KFC restaurants in Russia, most of which are run by franchisees. The company had already previously suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia. Pizza Hut opened its first Russian outlet at the start of the 1990s and the former leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev was featured in one of its television adverts in 1998. Heineken is stopping the production and sale of its own-brand beer in Russia, after previously halting all new investments and exports to the country. The Dutch brewer is taking immediate steps to ringfence its Russian operations from its wider business.  Also on Wednesday, Universal Music Group said it was “suspending all operations in Russia” and closing its offices in the country “effective immediately”. Here’s the full story: The maker of Winston cigarettes, Gauloises and Backwoods cigars adds it had already suspended operations in Ukraine to “prioritise the safety and wellbeing” of its 600 employees there.“Markets across Europe saw strong gains on Wednesday following decisions by the UK, US and EU to ban or curb Russian oil and gas imports, thereby putting further financial pressure on Russia,” says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell: The parenting company has decided to suspend all business in Russia, including shipments of products, and its local partner will immediately pause operations in some 120 stores and online.  Eugene Shvidler, the billionaire linked to the impounded jet in Farnborough, made his fortune in oil during the privatisation of Russian industry in the 1990s. Shvidler worked closely with Roman Abramovich, and was chief executive of oil company Sibneft. Sibneft was privatised through the controversial loans-for-shares auction in which Russian assets were sold off below their true value. Shvidler has been called Abramovich’s best friend back in 2006, Abramovich gave him a superyacht, Le Grand Bleu -- a 113m vessel so immense it comes with two smaller yachts (a 22 meter sailboat and a 21 meter powerboat), and a helipad. Back in 2009, the Observer ran a fascinating interview with Eugene Shvidler, in which he explained that Abramovich gave him a flock of Highland sheep for his 45th birthday. The sheep were then shipped to Shvidler’s 16th-century manor house in Bergerac, Chateau Thénac, the 200-hectare French vineyard. Shvidler, who holds a masters degree in applied mathematics, an MBA in finance and MS in international tax, came across as “surprisingly unshowy” for a billionaire, wrote Elizabeth Day: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast that the UK’s new aviation sanctions would close gaps allowing people to get around the ban on Russian airlines and private jets.  The Daily  reports that the jet is a Bombardier Global Express linked to oligarch Eugene Shvidler, the billionaire oil businessman and close friend of Roman Abramovich, and that officials are investigating if the jet or Mr Shvidler falls within the definition under the sanction order.  The new rules gives the power to detain any Russian aircraft in the UK, and includes any aircraft owned, operated or chartered by anyone connected with Russia or designated iniduals or entities. The current overflight and landing ban on Russian aircraft is also being strengthened, making it a criminal offence for any to fly or land in the United Kingdom. The UK will also ban exports of aviation or space-related goods and technology to Russia, including technical assistance. UK companies will also be banned from related providing insurance and re-insurance services. That means cover is withdrawn on existing policies and UK insurers and reinsurers will be unable to pay claims in respect of existing policies in these sectors, the Foreign Office says. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the new measures will further tighten the growing economic pressure on Russia: Russia is on the brink of defaulting on its debts, rating agency Fitch has warned, as the sanctions imposed since the Ukraine war batter its economy. Fitch has downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to its second lowest level, down six notches to C. That’s just one step above borrowers who have defaulted.

There are fewer mature applicants compared to 2021. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Arts, environment and language courses have recorded sharp increases in first-preference college applications this year.By contrast, nursing and many health-related courses show some of the steepest decreases. Popular fields of study such as business, law and science are also down slightly this year. Overall, latest Central Applications Offices (CAO) figures as of March 1st show there are 78,000 college applications this year, a 1.5 per cent decline on last year.There are fewer mature applicants compared to 2021 (-25 per cent), though this has been partly offset by an increase in EU (+16 per cent) and British application (+9 per cent).CAO points overall are likely to remain at about last year’s record-high levels due to a pledge by Minister for Education Norma Foley that Leaving Cert grades will be no lower than last year.There is particularly strong interest in environment-related courses which have one of the biggest increases in first-preferences this year (+35 per cent).Climate and sustainabilityUniversities say this is reflected in a jump in applications for courses linked to climate change and sustainability.UCD, for example, says applications to its interdisciplinary degree in sustainability are up 43 per cent, while city planning and environmental policy is up 44 per cent.Other areas nationally where there are significant increases in applications include languages (+17 per cent), architecture and construction (both up 6 per cent).Arts (+6 per cent) and humanities (+4 per cent) are also up for the second year in a row, reversing a trend of declining applications over recent years.In addition, interdisciplinary courses involving arts and humanities are up sharply (+59 per cent).The rebound of arts across inidual universities is striking. Maynooth University, for example, said its popular arts degree – which has the highest number of first-preference applications of any CAO course – is up by 11 per cent this year.There is a similar pattern at Trinity College Dublin where there is high demand for arts and humanities courses such as English studies (+21 per cent), European studies (+23 per cent) and philosophy (+54 per cent). UCD also said its humanities course (+29 per cent) was up significantly.Mid-wifery downSome of the biggest decreases are in the health sector, such as nursing and midwifery which is down 27 per cent on last year.In the wider area of health (-13 per cent), there is an uneven pattern with physiotherapy (-9 per cent) and pharmacy down (-7 per cent), while medicine is up (+4 per cent).Agriculture is also down sharply (-19 per cent), as are smaller sectors such as transport (-50 per cent ) and hygiene and occupational health services (-41 per cent).Business and administration remains one of the most popular fields of study, but is down slightly on last year (-3 per cent).The so-called Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) area is a mixed bag this year.Social and behavioural science is down (-6 per cent) along with biological and related science (-2 per cent), while physical science is up (+5 per cent). ICT is continuing its upward trend (+6 per cent) this year, while engineering remains unchanged.The latest data is subject to change when late applications are taken into account when the CAO’s change of mind facility closes on July 1st.

Photograph: Eric Luke The North’s obsession with its sectarian schism has plunged it into the “dark ages” in looking after its soaring minority ethnic population, a damning report by a Westminster watchdog has found.Despite a more than doubling of ethnic minorities in the region between 2001 and 2011 – the figures from a decade ago being the latest available – not a single elected representative in the Stormont Assembly is from an ethnic minority background, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee said.Hong Kong-born Anna Lo, an MLA for the centrist Alliance party for nine years, quit politics in 2016, because of racist abuse by loyalists and her disillusionment with continuing sectarianism.At the time of standing down, she said: “I do not feel safe here and I know many people who feel the same.”Three years later, according to latest official figures from 2019, only one of the North’s 462 local area councillors was from a recorded minority ethnic background.Neither the police nor the civil service fare well when it comes to ersity, according to the committee’s report – The Experiences of Minority Ethnic and Migrant People in Northern Ireland.During a series of witness testimonies as part of its inquiry, Andy George, president of the UK’s National Black Police Association, told the committee that minority ethnic officers made up just 0.5 per cent of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).The Northern Ireland Civil Service also admitted it had some way to go to remedy its shortcomings.Public appointmentsFigures from 20172018 – again the most recent published by Stormont’s power-sharing Executive office – show just 24 out of 942 public appointment applications were from minority ethnic people.Of the 183 people appointed to the civil service over the same period, “less than five” were minority ethnic applicants.According to the last census in 2011, 32,000 people living in the North were from a minority ethnic background. However this figure – 1.8 per cent of the population – is “widely expected” to show a significant increase in upcoming data.Despite this, there has been “no obvious policy preparedness to deal with this demographic change”, the report states.The minority population rise is expected to be bolstered by the resettlement in the region of thousands of refugees fleeing war and persecution in Syria and Afghanistan. The ongoing invasion of Ukraine will “almost certainly” add to the numbers.More than 1,800 Syrians have moved to the North since 2015.The report noted, after an almost year-long inquiry, that the number of racially motivated hate crimes in the North has superseded reported sectarian incidents.In the year to September 2021, 41 per cent of all hate-motivated crimes alerted to the PSNI were racist, compared to 38 per cent which were sectarian.The figure was all the more stark “when considered in relation to the small proportion of the population from minority ethnic backgrounds”, the watchdog warned.The PSNI told the inquiry there was “strong evidence to suggest that many other incidents go unreported to the police, meaning the true position of hate within society can be difficult to articulate”.The North’s Jewish community told the committee during its visit to the region about rising reports of anti-Semitic and Jewish-related hate incidents and crimes in Belfast, including anti-Semitic remarks made by public figures.“We also heard during that visit of an increase in incidents of verbal abuse in the street towards the Chinese community since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as experiences of attacks on and abuse towards members of the Polish community, linked to the EU referendum,” the report states.Anti-discrimination and hate crime laws in the North are “probably the worst on the books for the UK at the moment”, Kendall Bousquet, of Migrant Centre NI, told the inquiry.There was also evidence of “stark inequalities” in health, education and housing suffered by Irish Traveller communities in the North, with just 1 per cent of the community living to the age of 65, according to the latest decade-old figures.Geraldine McGahey, Northern Ireland Equality Commissioner, said the absence of any form of ethnic monitoring and only out-of-date data meant ersity policies were all “flawed”, leaving the region in “in the dark ages”.The Westminster committee – which includes MPs from the DUP, Alliance and the SDLP as well as Britain’s Labour and Conservative parties – has demanded the North’s Executive respond to its findings.Tory MP Simon Hoare, committee chairman, said the preoccupation with “GreenOrange discourse” has led to other and increasingly populated communities being “overlooked”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports.

The crisis in Ukraine has exposed the flaws, mistakes and downright complacency that has been evident for years to everyone except politicians desperate to burnish their green credentials whatever the cost.The so-called “net zero” commitment was the last act of Theresa May before she stepped down as prime minister in July 2019 but has been enthusiastically endorsed by her successor in a series of speeches and announcements. Until now, that is. Boris Johnson says there needs to be a new supply strategy in response to the energy crunch caused by Russia’s invasion, and he wants a temporary “climate change pass” to help manage the difficulties it has caused.Apparently this does not entail changing the 2050 target but rather ramping up oil and gas production in Europe so that countries such as Germany and Italy are less dependent on Russian supplies.He vouchsafed his new approach in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica and the German publication Die Welt last week. “We need a collective European strategy and a Western strategy to ersify away from this dependence,” Johnson reportedly said. “There are other sources ... in North America, in Canada, in the Gulf.”And in the UK, he might have added, but didn’t. Here, in a nutshell, was Britain’s green policy: we can make commitments to decarbonise our own energy supplies while importing the same products from other countries.It is the antithesis of energy security: a reliance on others to provide fuel for industry, heating and motoring while ignoring the available resources under our own feet. It is telling that on his list of alternatives is the Gulf, hardly the most stable of regions. Britain relies on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar to supplement pipeline supplies from Norway and the EU. This market-based import strategy follows the deliberate run-down of our own reserves, even though gas accounts for 40 per cent of UK electricity generation and heats the majority of homes. It assumes unimpeded supply while anticipating price volatility caused by circumstances. So the recent spike in prices was caused not by Russia but by the recovery of the world economy after the “unforeseen” Covid pandemic. This has now been exacerbated by fears of an embargo on Russian gas and oil which has seen market prices soar to unprecedented levels, even though European leaders are determined to resist emulating the import ban announced by President Biden last night.It is all well and good relying on LNG from Qatar, but if there were tensions in the Gulf between Israel and Iran over nuclear weapons, Tehran could block the Straits of Hormuz, stopping supplies of LNG.Anyone who says this is an unlikely scenario was presumably offering assurances to all who would listen that Russian would never invade Ukraine. The point is that you never know what might happen, which is why we need to secure our own supplies as much as possible.Yet it is instructive to look back at the debates in the Commons on the legislation to impose carbon reduction targets. You will find precious little discussion about the likely impact on price or supply. The 2008 Climate Change Act was opposed by precisely five Conservative MPs, denounced as “flat-earthers”, even by their own side, for deigning to ask whether the strategy was sensible.It committed the UK to reduce emissions by 80 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050, which was increased from a previous target of 60 per cent with hardly any debate. All that seemed to matter was that Britain was the “first country” in the world to adopt such a target, that this was a “landmark” moment and a “unique” measure. Its ramifications were simply trampled under a stampede of virtue signallers.The target was increased to 100 per cent by the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019, a statutory instrument that went through the Commons after a 90-minute debate. This is how matters of great strategic import are handled in this country – and not only here, it must be said. If you think our policy is bad, just look at Germany’s, where the madcap decision to dismantle its entire nuclear power programme is now being reversed.Mr Johnson’s new supply strategy, to be published “in days”, will give the go-ahead to North Sea oil and gas fields that have been awaiting approval but will only now get it because foreseeable events have come to pass. This strategy should also remove the moratorium on shale gas extraction, or fracking, but almost certainly won’t, denying the country an energy source that Mr Johnson himself once saw as our salvation.It should include a feasibility study of thorium-based nuclear reactors, using a fuel which is cleaner, cheaper and safer than uranium but which has always been blocked on cost grounds.It should include proper storage facilities: the decision to close the Rough facility in the North Sea and rely on contracted deliveries or the spot market was a massive mistake. It should include a re-examination of tidal barrage power dismissed in the past as too expensive but which looks cheap compared with the likely long-term costs of oil and gas.Tides in the UK are higher than almost anywhere in the world and can be harnessed every day under any conditions, unlike solar or wind power. The sea will rise and fall with metronomic precision twice a day until the Earth stops spinning and the Moon drops out of the sky.As an example of procrastination, the approach to tidal power takes some beating. The Severn Barrage, an engineering project to harness the tidal energy of Britain’s longest river and produce enough electricity to power all of Wales, was originally proposed in 1925, only to be shelved because, at £25 million, it was considered too expensive.In 1971, it was estimated that a barrage could be built at a cost £500  million. But since North Sea oil and gas was coming on stream there was no incentive to invest in tidal power. Various proposals have been put forward recently, both on the Severn and in Swansea Bay, but the cost is estimated in the billions of pounds and is opposed on environmental grounds.

To be clear, Russia is not likely to win this war. It probably won’t be able to capture Kyiv, and any city it does gain will not be held onto for long. This is not political hope-talk but my professional assessment as the former commanding general of US Army Europe.Russia’s key problem is logistics. Look, for instance, at the infamous convoy that has now stalled north of Kyiv. It is a commander’s nightmare, forcing troops to consume the supplies they were meant to carry forward. No military planner would purposely allow such a large group of personnel to sit road-bound on a single highway, surrounded by agricultural land too soft to allow vehicles to ert.While Ukraine may not have the air capabilities to destroy all of these vehicles, it can take bites out of the convoy. Indeed this is already happening.Russia’s logistics capability may only have been readied for a lightning campaign, in anticipation that Kyiv would be captured in a matter of days rather than weeks or months. That, of course, has not happened – and the more that flawed assumption is disproven, the more sluggish the entire operation will become. The further into Ukraine Russian oil tanks move, the more exposed they are to attack.Russia will soon struggle to deliver basic food and petrol supplies to the front, leaving soldiers hungry and immobile.Such failures have given President Zelensky the opportunity to galvanise his population and the Ukrainian armed forces. They are now capable not just of holding ground but pushing back too, as they did in Kharkiv last week. Russia will have to fight a war of attrition to avoid outright defeat, bombing roads and flats as well as military infrastructure. Even then, Moscow could quickly run out of the kinds of ammunition required to sustain it at an intense level.President Putin might well be asking how, after all the rhetoric about modernising his forces, it has come to this. The truth is that there appears to be a lack of high-intensity experience. Apart from Syria – which is an air operation, with air bases serving as simple logistics hubs – Russia has not been able to test its new systems over terrain as large as Ukraine. Interventions in Chechnya and Georgia did not pose the same challenge of sheer land mass.The West should respond to this weakness with strength. We can help push the Ukrainians over the line. A no-fly zone, which I originally supported, would not solve the problem, since most of the damage being done is by artillery and rocket fire based on the ground.Something we can do immediately is provide Ukraine with the capability to knock out these rocket launchers and missile sites. Counterfire radars, for instance, not only provide an early warning of attack but also identify the point of origin so that it can be rapidly targeted. Ukrainian forces already know how to deploy these systems to great effect. Give them more.We could also train Ukrainian special forces to go after the launch sites in the same manner US special forces went after scud missile sites during Desert Storm and the Iraq war. This would mean providing intelligence, specialised weaponry and laser designators.Ultimately, this campaign will end with information operations. We have seen how effective the Ukrainian government has been with its social media efforts, jolting the world to its cause and discrediting Putin’s claims domestically. Western institutions should back this up with a campaign targeted at the Russian army’s spring conscription period. Tens of thousands of Russian families are being asked to step forward.If we can reach these families with the realities of the war, showing that their teenage sons are being used as cannon fodder, perhaps they will pressure the Kremlin to stop killing fellow Slavs.Lieutenant General (Retired) Ben Hodges holds the Pershing Chair in Strategic Studies at the Center for European Policy AnalysisMore from NewsPolitics latest news: UK must drop barriers to refugees, urges Ukrainian ambassador as he criticises visa systemRussia-Ukraine latest news: Radioactive substances could be released from Chernobyl after power switched offChina cannot allow Putin to failVerschlimmbesserung – the new German word you need in your lifeLatest pictures from Ukraine: Day-long ceasefire agreed to allow civilians to flee \u0026#39Our parents are turning in their graves\u0026#39: Ukrainian officer begs Russian politician cousin to stop the warMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands pupils left school lockdowns never came back","story":"Lockdown has led pupils to leave school and not return, the Children’s Commissioner has said as she admitted “tens of thousands” are missing from education.On Wednesday, Dame Rachel de Souza published an audit of local authorities (LAs) revealing a “striking” lack of accurate and up-to-date data on the numbers of children in each area.The report argues that this means vulnerable pupils could fall through the cracks and miss out on crucial support.“While the majority of children are attending every day, there are tens of thousands of children who are persistently or severely absent or missing from education altogether,” Dame Rachel said.She added that there were “some children who haven’t come back after the lockdowns, and not just because of having to isolate due to Covid”.Dame Rachel said that, even prior to the pandemic, there were children who were “falling through the gaps in education” if they were waiting for a school place, were being home educated because their needs were not being met in school, or who had simply “fallen off the radar”.She said she had surveyed all local authorities, which revealed the “striking” finding that LAs “do not have an accurate figure of how many children there are in England – let alone the number of children not receiving education”.Out of 145 LAs surveyed, making up 96 per cent of the total, just 39 per cent could provide an estimate on the number of children who missed at least a week of school waiting for a school placement, while fewer than one in five (18 per cent) could estimate the number of children attending private schools.Only eight per cent could give an estimate of the number of children in home education who were not registered with the LA.All LAs that responded did provide an estimate of the number of children who were electively home educated, but these estimates ranged from 0 per cent to 2.4 per cent.In total, 92 per cent were able to provide an estimate of the number of children missing from education but these estimates ranged from 0 per cent to 4.1 per cent.Around half of all LAs could provide an estimate of persistent and severe absence last term, with figures suggesting that 22 per cent of pupils were persistently absent while 1.5 per cent were severely absent.“These estimates suggest 1,782,000 children were persistently absent and 124,000 children were severely absent,” the report said.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Radioactive substances could be released from Chernobyl after power switched offPolitics latest news: UK must drop barriers to refugees, urges Ukrainian ambassador as he criticises visa systemChina cannot allow Putin to failVerschlimmbesserung – the new German word you need in your lifeLatest pictures from Ukraine: Day-long ceasefire agreed to allow civilians to flee \u0026#39Our parents are turning in their graves\u0026#39: Ukrainian officer begs Russian politician cousin to stop the warMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"verschlimmbesserung new german word need life","story":"Of all the German terms for which we don’t have equivalents in English, Verschlimbesserrung, the act of making something worse by trying to make it better, may be the most poetic. (Although kustomerseparationprism, their term for the little triangular ider at supermarket checkouts, comes a close second.) Examples of Verschlimbesserung are all around us. Sitcoms depend on them: think of Father Ted trying to even out a dent in his car and trashing the whole thing. Sport is full of it, too. The Hundred seems to have hastened the demise of the England cricket team Cristiano Ronaldo’s return has heralded the destruction of Manchester United. You could make a persuasive argument that most politics is a study in Verschlimbesserung. It’s not a perfect translation, but we do have a version of this thought in English: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Here are five common causes of Verschlimbesserung in day to day life. HonestyAt certain junctures we all feel compelled to speak the truth. A friend has put on weight, or is drinking too much, or sleeping with someone to whom they are not married. At such fraught moments, the urge to confess, or reveal a secret, can be irresistible. Just a little dollop of truth, you think, and the situation will be resolved. It never happens like that. Jack Nicholson was right, we can\u0027t handle the truth. One man’s clear-the-air revelation is another’s unwelcome meddling. They will probably know they have put on weight, or that they are drinking too much. They might even already suspect their partner is cheating. (In France they will presume it.) Nobody ever thanks you for airing their dirty laundry. Especially not if they say “thank you for telling me”. Small amounts of DIY I’m not talking about the big ticket grands projets here. If you’re attempting your own loft conversion or digging a car park into your basement you probably know what you are doing, or ought to. I mean the minor tasks, so meagre you think getting a professional in would be demeaning to both of you. What kind of a man or woman, you think to yourself, gets another man or woman to come in to touch up a minor bit of paintwork or drill a few holes? This is a grave error. If the 2012 case of the ‘Monkey Christ’ taught us anything, the act of trying to improve a painting can easily ruin it. A devout octogenarian decided to “fix” a fresco in the church of the small Spanish town where she lived, turning a respectable Jesus into a blurry potato. The same is true of DIY. By the time you capitulate and summon a professional, the problem will be twice as bad and the humiliation twice as acute.DietingThe road to a Verschlimbesserung is paved with good intentions. There are few forms of self-improvement purer than dieting. You wake up one morning, not necessarily on January 1 or Ash Wednesday, resolved to cut out the carbohydrates and ditch the booze. Everything goes swimmingly for the first day. Maybe two days. But before you know it the starvation kicks in and you relapse at the biscuit tin. Your panicked monkey-brain demands more calories than before. By the end of the week you are fatter than when you began, not to say depressed and bristling with self-recrimination. Cutting your own hairGlancing in the mirror before a date or important meeting you are struck by a strange and shaggy-looking Yeti figure. Not the kind of person to give any kind of job to. Just a bit off here, you think, and you’ll emerge into Don Draper. Just lop that little fringe in, attend to the emergent rat-tail at the back, buzz that back of the neck fuzz with the clippers. It’s uneven, so you have to do a bit more. In this way your personal appearance dies by a thousand cuts. It’s how the mullet was invented. If you look like David Beckham or Kristen Stewart your rogue lid will become a trend. If you look like the rest of us, your colleagues will present you with Toni \u0026amp Guy vouchers. See also: plastic surgery. RebrandingOnce in a while every company feels the urge to rebrand, to tweak something to improve its product. Sometimes they are distancing themselves from an increasingly toxic reputation. BP, for example, hoped that by switching to a simple acronym people would forget its distant previous association with fossil fuels. Sometimes it is a disaster. WeightWatchers became WW and its earnings collapsed. Coke discovered that people were not ready for New Coke. You can’t fool consumers. The same applies for personal rebrands, as attempted by undergraduates as long as universities have existed. It never works. We can’t run from our true selves, especially not since social media arrived to provide a handy archive of your dreadful looks. In some cases, whole countries attempt to rebrand. The Czech Republic became Czechia, not that your dad noticed. It remains to be seen whether Brexit will be the ultimate Verschlimbesserrung, or simply an act of improvement. Either way, you can bet the Germans will have a view.What moments of Verschlimmbesserung have you encountered?

It will also bring in a long-awaited ‘register of beneficial ownership’ to better show the chains of who really owns vast assets through shadowy firms.Home Secretary Priti Patel insisted the Bill would set a new global standard for transparency.But critics warn loopholes will give Vladimir Putinaposs cronies a head start and “get-out-of-London-free” card - with time to hide their dirty money”.  Cross-party rebels were racing tonight to toughen up the Economic Crime Bill in the Lords with a flurry of amendments tomorrow. One furious MP told the Mirror: “There’s the danger that by rushing it through, you botch something that would have been a good tool.” Another pointed out it doesn’t actually do much on sanctions, it’s all about transparency - and MPs are trying to “dress it up as something it’s not”. So what are the six biggest hitches in the law  We go through them here.  Six-month grace period for declaring assets The Bill will introduce a “public register of beneficial owners of overseas entities owning land in the UK, which will be held by Companies House”. This is after years of complaints that dirty money is plunged into London property through shadowy offshore property. There are still several concerns about this - more on this below. But a principle one was the time period for declaring your assets. It was going to be  months and Tory ministers cut it to six months.But the government refused to accept Labour ’s plans for a -day grace period to declare assets in the UK.Labour’s Seema Malhotra warned: “Six months still provides ample time for criminals to sell properties and find other assets in which to invest.” Ministers did promise to name oligarchs who sell up during the transition. Business minister Paul Scully: “They will have to register ownership, so we will get their ownership details either when they sell or at the end of the transition period.”  Could assets still just be declared via an offshore company Tory MP Anthony Mangnall questioned whether the register of beneficial ownership, as drawn up, will let oligarchs “get away with it”. He wanted ministers to address the issue of nominees - lawyers often in a Panama or Virgin Islands company who are supposedly the owner. He said: “Do the enforcement mechanism and the reference to named iniduals enable us to stop them doing that ”Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith replied: “They should, because the inidual has to declare the whole chain. “Not knowing” would be no excuse.”Former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick added: “If I wanted to conceal the ownership of a property, I would simply set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands… We must resolve that.” Assets won’t be seized immediately Boris Johnson told his MPs to reject plans to immediately freeze assets, such as land, flats, mansions, yachts and aircraft, when an oligarch’s name is announced - and before they are actually sanctioned.Cross-party MPs led by Tory David Davis put forward the amendment but it was defeated -. It wold have immediately banned anyone formally named by the UK government from selling any assets or moving them out of the UK. It would have covered land, houses, businesses, art, jeweller, yachts, jets, gold and bank deposits. Mr Davis said: “What will we see during the months it takes to get people to the legal point at which they are sanctioned  “We will see Russians scrambling to sell off their houses, dispose of their businesses and offload their football clubs.”  People who help the ‘economic wellbeing of the UK’ could be exempt Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said she was concerned one exemption could “drive a coach and horses” through the crackdown. She pointed out there is an exemption to declaring ownership of propertya Tory minister decides it is “in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the UK.” There is also an exemptionit is “in the interests of national security” or “for the purposes or preventing or detecting serious crime.” But an amendment to overturn this was not selected so could not be voted on in the Commons. They could transfer to a minority stake or a family member UK officials admit they are limited in what they can freeze or seize when sanctioning oligarchs. This is because under current sanctions law, ownership counts as owning more than half of something, and family members are not subject to sanctions. While the Bill is mainly about transparency rather than actual sanctions, it will be slightly better on this front. When deciding how property should be declared, “beneficial ownership” will be defined as owning % or more of an asset.But SNP MP Alison Thewliss had urged ministers to lower the threshold for beneficial ownership from % to %.She said: “Evidence already points to the threshold being gamed and to people appointing family members and those they can easily control, and the Government need to be aware of that and do more to prevent it.”  Shutting off Russian banks’ access to the West, with plan to move to full asset freeze on all Russian banks.  Sanctions on Russian central bank and financial institutions, already in effect.  Preventing Russian firms and the Russian state raising debt in the UK, already enacted.  Asset freeze against inidual oligarchs, with  so far including Putin and Lavrov and more to come.  Targeting key strategic sectors including defence with more planned on services and energy.  Blocking access to SWIFT, with UK still pushing for a full SWIFT ban against all Russian banks.  Banning Russian planes and ships landing in UK, with new laws next week to put this on longer-term footing.  Banning export to Russia of ‘dual-use’ items such as electronics that could be used in military computers or weaponry.  Setting a £, limit on wealthy Russians’ deposits in UK bank accounts.  Extending the above sanctions to Belarus due to its role supporting the Russian invasion.  Extending UK-Crimea total trade embargo to the Luhansk and Donetsk ‘People’s Republics’. But still no date, due to concerns about protecting Ukrainians still there.  Sanctions on all members of Russian Parliament and Russian National Security who voted in support of invasion. Still in progress despite EU acting already. For more information click here. Enforcement Critics say the law will be useless without proper enforcement, and it doesn’t currently exist. Government-ally MPs also voted down bids to be more transparent about the funding of enforcement, and to bring a new law reforming Companies House. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, former chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said agencies charged with punishing breaches are “no longer fit for purpose” after a decade of austerity. She said: “Money laundering prosecutions have dropped by % over the past five years, just as money laundering has increased and intensied in the UK economy. Fraud is now the most common crime committed in the UK, with more than  million offences, but hardly any are prosecuted.” Ms Hodge told the Mirror: “This is not an Economic Crime Bill. It’s simply a transparency issue around properties. They’re trying to dress it up as something it’s not.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyEuropean UnionPriti PatelBoris JohnsonIain Duncan SmithMargaret HodgeVladimir PutinCrimeBritish economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

More than two million people have left their homeland.But just  British visas so far have been granted to people fleeing Vladimir Putin ’s forces.Bungling Home Office ministers were tonight scrambling to quell mounting criticism.Beleaguered Immigration Minister Kevin Foster - who appeared in the Commons instead of Ms Patel - was slammed by all sides as he claimed checks were needed to thwart Russian spies pretending to be Ukrainian asylum seekers from slipping into Britain and carrying out nerve agent attacks.  No announced a special Minister for Refugees as Downing Street tried to catch up with the public mood.But veteran Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale suggested Home Secretary Priti Patel should quit.Quoting Ms Patel’s words from  hours earlier, he told the Commons: “The Home Secretary said, ‘I have already made it clear in terms of the visa application centre that has now been set up en route to Calais, that we have staff in Calais’. “That was untrue, and under any normal administration, that in itself would be a resignation issue.” Conservative Tracey Crouch said some refugees could wait seven weeks for an appointment at a Polish centre. She said: “We have been advised to get people to Rzeszów in Poland for biometric testing to support their application, but the word on the ground is that there are no biometric appointments in Rzeszów until the end of next month.” Former Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: “Snails also move ‘at pace’.”  A long line of MPs slammed the Home Office for the fact a sponsorship route for Ukrainians with no family links to the UK is still not set up. It will allow Brits, firms and charities to bring refugees to the UK for an “initial”  monthsthey provide accommodation. There are hopes warm-hearted Brits could give up their spare rooms - but there is still no date for the scheme to launch. Tory MP Steve Brine added: “So much about this doesn’t feel right and my constituents know what they see. “All of this is far too robotic, and there’s very little Christian compassion being shown at the moment. “Surely we are past the UK saying we’re going to have a generous scheme - it’s time to deliver a generous scheme.” Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke said: “I’m proud of my constituents who are coming forward to offer as much help as possible. I’m proud of the Prime Minister in the way he is leading the world.  But the Home Office is cutting off their legs. And it is simply not good enough. Does the Home Office recognise that this is a war of the likes that’s not been seen for  years ” He added: “This is a disgrace… Get a grip!” Tory MP Julian Sturdy said: “Now is not the time for box-ticking and red tape. Now is the time to do everything we can.No more excuses. Weeks is simply not good enough! These are women and children! We have to speed it up!” Ministry of Defence officials will help process visa applications, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace revealed. But the defiant Home Office tonight continued to resist pleas for a visa application centre at Calais - the port in northern France closest to Britain where Ukrainian refugees have mustered in the hope of joining relatives already in the UK. Instead, the ministry is opening a “pop-up” centre in Lille, with Eurostar laying on free trains to help exhausted and frightened families travel from Calais to Lille for processing. Amid rising anger that refugees gathering in Calais were being sent to Brussels and Paris for checks, the Home Office initially refused to say where a promised centre “en route to Calais” would be set up.But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss let slip to the Commons that it was Lille.Immigration Minister Mr Foster then faced furious MPs demanding to know why the processing of applications was taking so long.Shadow Home secretary Yvette Cooper said: Two million refugees have left Ukraine. Other countries are supporting hundreds and thousands of people.“The Home Office is currently issuing just around  family scheme visas a day. Most want to stay close to home but some want to come here to join family or friends, and we should be helping them. “Instead most people are still being held up by our Home Office bureaucracy or being turned away. Mr Foster claimed security checks were needed on refugees to make sure they were not Kremlin agents who could unleash a nerve agent attack in Britain - like the  novichok atrocity in Salisbury. The Government will not take chances with the security of this country and our people, Mr Foster told MPs. He added: “Sadly, we are already seeing people presenting at Calais with  documents claiming to be Ukrainian. “With incidents like Salisbury still in our minds, the Government will not take chances with the security of this country and our people.” Furious MPs lined up to condemn the Home Office approach. SNP MP Stuart C McDonald fumed: Don’t quote Salisbury at us, that has absolutely nothing to do with this.Tory MP Andrew Murrison added: “Salisbury borders my constituency. I fully accept the need for security checks, particularly on adult males. But the fact remains that Ireland, with which we share a common travel area, has a population of million but has committed to , refugees from Ukraine and has admitted already over ,. This country, population million, has come nowhere even close to that. Why not ” Lib Dem Tim Farron said Mr Foster had “misread the country”, with British families “desperate” to help Ukrainians. The party’s home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: This is yet more chaos and incompetence from the dysal Home Office.” Defending the Government’s handling of the crisis, Mr Foster said it had “brought forward a generous humanitarian offer to those Ukrainians who want to come to the UK to escape the conflict”. He added: “Last week, the Home Secretary announced a new Ukraine family scheme for those with family ties to the UK, and we are extending the scheme further to include aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins and in-laws. “The scheme went live last Friday and has already seen over , applications submitted, for which over  visas have been issued, with more being issued as we speak. “We have also announced that we are setting up a new humanitarian sponsorship visa, and we are working at pace with our colleagues in the Department for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities to set that up.” Foreign Secretary Ms Truss also faced MPs’ rage when she answered questions in the Commons.Shadow Foreign Office Minister Catherine West blasted a “paltry effort to offer refuge” and accused the Government of a shameful lack of humanity, saying the shambles was a stain on its efforts to tackle the Ukraine crisis. Former Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said sending Ukrainian refugees who want to come to Britain to Brussels and Paris to apply for visas brings the UK into disrepute.SNP frontbencher Chris Law blasted the Home Officeaposs “continued xenophobic and inhumane immigration policy”, claiming it was “a complete humiliation” for the Government.

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

Gayle, who works at the Rossington store in South Yorks., saved Nigelaposs le when he had a cardiac arrest and stopped breathing.Thanks to her quick thinking and CPR knowledge, she used the beat of the Bee Gees song Staying Alive to perform le-saving compressions for  minutes, ManchesterEveningNews reports. In a message to shoppers, ASDA wrote: Gayle from our Rossington store used the beat of Stayinapos Alive by the Bee Gees to perform lesaving CPR for  minutes when regular customer Nigel had a cardiac arrest and stopped breathing while out shopping with his we Vicki. When Nigel collapsed by the checkouts, Gayle rushed over to help while a customer called .  Nigel, , ed to the store to thank Gayle after he got out of the hospital. He told Asda: Gayle has given me a second chance she saved my le. There is no thank you big enough to say to her. She just jumped in and did what she had to do to save my le before the ambulance crews got there. Some people may have panicked but not Gayle. She went above and beyond. I will be eternally grateful to her. Asda said that more than  of their stores have a defibrillator, and Gayle used her storeaposs one to monitor Nigelaposs heart. Gayle told Asda: The defibrillator kept analysing his heart rhythms and continued to tell me to keep doing CPR and then it said shock required so we stood back and then continued CPR. At this point, he still wasnapost breathing.  We carried on, really determined, and then there was a lady there who was a carer who jumped in for me at the very end and did three or four compressions, and he started to take gasps for air. There was just sheer relief when he started to breathe again, and the paramedics arrived at that point. Thousands have praised Gayle for saving Nigelaposs le. Responding to Asdaaposs message, one said: Well done Gayle So many people would panic and not know what to do. So good to know how to carry out CPR and use a defibrillator. It is lesaving, literally. So pleased Nigel has recovered. Another wrote: Well done Gayle. More people need to know how to administer CPR, thankfully you did. One added: mins is a superhuman amount of time to do CPR, that’s incredible, well done. One said: Well done More people need to learn how to do CPR and how to use a Defibrillator.

They have been greeted with floods of donations.  Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. It is the largest conventional military attack on a sovereign state in Europe since the Second World War. Putin recently placed his nuclear forces on higher alert, raising tensions between the West and Russia. The invasion has caused a refugee crisis - Europeaposs largest since the Second World War.The UN said two million people have now fled Ukraine.But Putinaposs forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian resistance and Russia could lose the war, according to a top UK admiral. As the Russian President vows to press on with the invasion, Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said the invasion in Ukraine is not going well for the Kremlin.He added Putinaposs forces are in a mess with eight Russian aircraft shot down in one day, losing , troops a day and a huge convoy of , soldiers and hundreds of vehicles at a standstill. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterAsked whether Russia taking over Ukraine was inevitable, Sir Tony told the BBC : No. I think weaposve seen a Russian invasion that is not going well.I think weaposre also seeing remarkable resistance by Ukraine, both its armed forces and its people and weaposre seeing the unity of the whole globe coming together, applying pressure to Russia. Russia is suffering, Russia is an isolated power. It is less powerful than it was ten days ago. Some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response. Youaposve also seen basic failures in terms of maintenance and their kit failing. Russia hasnapost operated at this scale since the Second World War and it is incredibly complex and dficult. However, he said the key call of Kyiv - a no-fly zone - would not help those on the ground.Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly called for a no-fly zone but Putin warned that imposing one would be considered participation in the armed conflict.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The couple, from Hawick, bought a bungalow for £, above the asking price which they plan to demolish and build the five-bedroom villa in its place with views of Edinburgh Castle and beyond.Lisaaposs parents David and Carol Martin won the UK National Lottery jackpot six years ago when they said they wanted to travel to space with the cash. Now they are helping their daughter who has submitted Grand Designs plans of the modest three-bed bungalow they bought last year, reports Edinburgh Live. Lisa and Craig have submitted plans to Edinburgh Council requesting to demolish the bungalow, according to the Scottish Sun. The building is expected to be one of the most modern properties the city has ever seen, described by their planning agents as a signicant statement. Blueprints for the home reveal the use of glittering zinc, bricks and glass which usually appears on Channel aposs Grand Designs show hosted by Kevin McCloud. One property developer who has built homes for millionaires said: “It is quite a spectacular home but the first thing that strikes you about it is the sheer scale of the place. “Edinburgh’s planners are a conservative bunch, so a plan which seems to gobble up its garden may struggle to win planning permission.  “There also appears to be a fairly dramatic driveway which curves up to the property, something you would expect to see in the Hollywood Hills. This has the potential to be a £ million house.” The current footprint of the bungalow is around  sq ft with the mansion seeing an increase of around , sq ft. The main living accommodation sits on the upper floor, with a dining and kitchen area connected by stairs to a large living space, with windows on each side. All the bedrooms appear to come with glass-fronted balconies as well. City of Edinburgh Council confirmed it received an official planning application last month. The couple were not available for comment when approached by EdinburghLive. Lisaaposs parents won £ million in what was the UKaposs biggest ever Lotto win in . Mr and Mrs Martin both sat in silence for five minutes shaking their heads when they learned they had become instant millionaires. Speaking at the time, the couple said they hoped to buy a ticket to outer space with Mr Martin having his heart set on a £, ticket onboard Richard Bransonaposs Virgin Galactic. Mrs Martin said: “What have we done ” before the couple drank endless cups of Tetley tea to let the news sink in.

While the passenger locator form has been simplied, it remains a requirement for people heading back to the UK from holidays and could be removed completely. Travelling has become more straight forward in recent months for people who have been vaccinated and they no longer need to take Covid tests before departure and then on theirto the UK. And also under discussion for ministers will be the possible removal of the testing requirements for the unvaccinated. The removal of the passenger locator form could be a boost for the tourism industry ahead of the Easter holidays which is reportedly the aim of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. The forms were introduced two years ago as a means of tracking infections and went into signicant detail at a time when travellers had to quarantine on theirto the UK. Currently the form is a lot more simple and requires people’s address, contact number and flight details. For unvaccinated people they need to still have a lateral flow test,  hours before they travel back to the UK and then have another PCR test two days after they arrive.  Ryanair boss Michael OaposLeary said scrapping the passenger locator form is long overdue.He told the Daily Mail: Itaposs a shambles. They should ditch it, itaposs completely irrelevant. Nobody collects them, nobody checks them or follows up on them. They were designed to pretend that the politicians were doing something to protect people.There is a possibility that a meeting to discuss scrapping all Covid rules could be postponed due to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.Currently flight bookings and prices are bouncing back following a relativeto normalcy for popular destinations like Spain. Last month Boris Johnson announced his long term plan to “live with Covid”.Self isolation laws for people with Covid were axed on February , meaning people with the virus would no longer be legally required to stay at home for the first time in nearly two years. People were still advised to quarantinethey catch Covid but it was no longer a legal requirement. Routine contact tracing also ended. This meant vaccinated Brits people no longer were required to test daily for seven daysthey came into contact with an infected person and unvaccinated people didnapost have to quarantine. A Government spokesman was reported to have said: We keep all measures under review, including the ongoing use of the passenger locator form, and will be updating on our contingency plans to fight any new iants ahead of Easter.

Alex Holland’s body was tragically found face down in water by a dog walker on February . His mum Rachel last saw him on the night of November  when he stepped outside their front door to have a cigarette.And she claims US psychic Mary Lawton Johnson contacted both her and Kent Police to tell them where they would find missing Alex, .The renowned medium also says she is convinced Alex was murdered - and that police should do more to investigate. Mary, who lives in Florida and has never been to the Hollands’ hometown in Kent, saw visions of Alex face down in a pool of water. She says she sent  emails to the police and Alex’s family with maps highlighting areas of water which should be searched. Despite pressure from both women, police did not search those areas. Guidelines published by the College of Policing in  advise that information from psychics should not be dismissed. According to mum Rachel, Alex was found in one of Mary’s highlighted areas wearing one shoe and his death still remains a mystery. The other open-toed and backless shoe was recovered ft from where his hire car was found.His phone was still in the car, but no suicide note had been left. Despite putting pressure on the police to find them, Rachel says she still doesnapost know where his wallet or car keys are. Alex’s body was found approximately . miles away from their family home in Deal, Kent. Rachel, , suspects that her son was murdered and his body disposed of in the water - a suspicion Mary supports. The psychic believes three people were involved in Alex’s death. A post mortem examination has recorded the cause of death as aposunexplainedapos. Rachel said: “I believe my son was murdered. “Right now, I can’t prove that but I do because too many things don’t add up. “I just want the truth. “Last time I saw him, he popped his head round my bedroom door and told me and his dad he was going to have a cigarette, shower and then go to bed. “He asked his dad to wake him up in the morning for work. “But I got up an hour later to go to the toilet and realised he wasn’t in, so I thought he must have just gone out. “I was phoning his mobile the next day, and come tea time I was worried. “I thought ‘I need to know where he is’ and called the police to report him missing.” Alex was living back home with his parents after separating from his we before he went missing. Police and search parties went looking for him  hours after he was last seen. His body wasn’t found for another  days.  Rachel is certain her son didn’t commit suicide. She added: “I know what it’s like to hit a point so low that you’re at that stage - but my son wasn’t like that. “And he would have never left his two girls - he loved them. “He was such a loving dad. “He was a loving son too, he was a good son. “He’d phone us every day to check in on us.” Psychic Mary made contact with Alex’s family in the weeks after he went missing. She told Rachel that she had driven past a very angry man on the side of the road near her home in Florida. She quickly realised that man was a vision of Alex. Mary was quite scared by how angry Alex was and told his family it was because he had been jumped and killed the night he went missing. Rachel added: “I’ve said that to the police since day one. “I believe he was dragged out of his car and taken in another vehicle and killed. “Police wouldn’t believe me - they wouldn’t listen to a single word I said.”Alex’s family raised awareness of his disappearance with emotional appeals and a dedicated Facebook page.After months of no leads, his body was recovered from water in Hacklinge, Kent. Officials have stipulated to his family that he is likely to have been there the whole time - meaning Mary’s predictions were right all along. Mary says she has sent descriptions of three suspects to officers but police continue to treat Alex’s death as non-suspicious. Toxicology reports are not expected for at least another  weeks. Kent Police said officers have made extensive enquiries following the death of Alex Holland from Deal who had been reported missing on Sunday  November  and whose body was discovered on Thursday  February  near Hacklinge in Kent. A report is being prepared for the coroner who will hold an inquest to determine the cause of death. Detective Inspector Louise Murphy of Kent Police said: A number of enquiries have been carried out into the circumstances of the death, including reviewing CCTV footage and examining mobile phone data and, based on the available information, there is nothing so far to suggest the death is suspicious. A post-mortem has been completed and we are treating the death as unexplained at this stage, pending further toxicology results. All of the evidence gathered will be submitted to the coroner for consideration. Updates have been provided to the family of the deceased where appropriate and we will continue to relay any concerns or questions they may have to the coroner. We appreciate how dficult this is for Alex’s family and friends and our thoughts remain with them.

Graphic designer David Benqué, , and his partner Claire OaposBrien, , say they lost £, worth of belongings when a freak flood destroyed their south London flat. They claim they have since spent nearly £, replacing damaged items and relocating - bringing the total spent to £,. The couple says they are furious with Thames Water, who they claim gave them no compensation after a collapsed sewer caused the carnage in September .Thames Water refused legal liability because there were no previous issues with the sewer, therefore they claim they were not negligent, MyLondon reports.  Thames Water also reportedly asked the couple to sign a letter meaning they wonapost pay for aposun-restorableapos items. David and Claire say they refused to sign the letter and had to fork out £, to dispose of the wrecked belongings themselves. David said: I was alerted to the sound and the smell, something did not seem right. I saw a torrent of water. The pipe that exploded was under a bin so there was a bunch of rubbish floating.  I opened the door and saw the whole staircase was like a waterfall. I closed the door and for a couple of seconds, my brain said it would be fine. Then I knew it was not going to be okay so I woke my partner up. Once Claire was awake they grabbed the children, their teddies and put an iPad up high. David said he got his coat and laptop, but the computer later fell into the sludge.  David recalled: The water was coming through the door so we thought it was time to go out, then the door opened and let a torrent of sewage in. Our furniture started floating and then it got pretty intense.The fire brigade arrived as the water was filling the basement.David added: I was carrying my five-year-old, I saw the firefighters so I crawled so they could see us. They helped my partner who was carrying the three-year-old and she could not walk forward the pressure was so strong, so he was carried by a fireman.  The coupleaposs flat wasnapost the only one affected and other neighbours were rescued from their windows because the water pressure was so strong. By the next day, the extent of the damage could be seen and the costs started to mount up. Thames Water said the family was not eligible for the hardship fund. David said: We are lucky we have family and friends that are able to help us, but we are broke as hell now. There were lots of upsetting moments but when you walk into your flat and see a book your kidsapos like and itaposs covered in muck. You could see stuff that was familiar but itaposs all in the wrong place and everything is covered. Then we realised they were not going to give us any money at all. Textile designer Claire said: Now the time has passed it was actually a really traumatic event to be woken up to a torrent of water rushing into your home. The trauma of seeing how much water was in our flat, just filled up like a bath. Itaposs been really dficult just the devastation, the time and stress to get back on our feet and have nothing from Thames Water. We feel like criminals that do not matter when itaposs their pipe that exploded on our lives. A few hours earlier it could have been a very dferent story but it was still pretty terrying. The fact that it was sewage water, itaposs toxic. The kidsapos stuff is sentimental, they still talk about it all the time. It makes you think lots of people would not be able to get back on their feet. That really stuck with me, the utter devastation, everything gone within five minutes. Itaposs a terrible thing for your family to go through. Itaposs not our fault, or climate change, itaposs Thames Water. A Thames Water spokesperson told The Mirror: “We understand how distressing sewer flooding is and we sympathise with anyone affected. “In this case, the flooding was caused by a collapsed sewer which caused sewage to spill out into nearby properties. Our engineers were quickly on the scene and carried out repairs as a matter of urgency. Investigations show there were no previous issues with the sewer which would have contributed to the collapse, and as such Thames Water was not negligent and is not legally liable for the damage caused. “As with all sewer flooding, we offered to clean and sanitise affected properties, which includes removing belongings which are too damaged to be ed to the property. In order to do this, we ask our customers to sign a document acknowledging that we won’t be reimbursing them for the items removed. “We encourage anyone affected by the devastating impact of sewer flooding to make a claim through their home insurance provider.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Thames Water PLCiPadClimate changeHouse insuranceFloods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We have a Facebook group. We love her style and her contact with people. We were waiting for this visit from the very beginning. What would she wear  Would she bring the children  So what did Kate say when they told her she is beautul and perfect  Magda added: She said itaposs not true - itaposs just the make-up.” On that trip to Poland Kate was with William - but last month she undertook a rare solo visit.

She travelled alone to the Danish capital Copenhagen for a two-day visit, where she learned about the countryaposs approach to early years development. She also had an audience with Denmarkaposs Queen Margrethe and carried out a visit to a womenaposs crisis centre with Crown Princess Mary. For many, one of the highlights of the visit was seeing Kate whizzing down a huge slide when she visited the Lego Foundation PlayLab. And royal expert and biographer Robert Jobson told True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat that she really came out of herself on the trip.He said: “Kate seemed more relaxed without William, who can be a bit fussy when he’s on royal jobs. The fact that she went down that slide, I’m not sure she necessarily would have done thathe was there. She was on good form, all smiles, very confident. Probably more confident than when she’s alongside William. She spoke very well. I thought she really came out of herself when she was there...She didn’t have to refer to William.

Kate enrolled at the University of St Andrews in Fe, Scotland, where she studied the history of art.And while she has never been a big drinker, she threw herself into Freshersapos Week - a university tradition of welcoming new students with a week of nights out and partying - and earned herself an impressive nickname. Royal author Katie Nicholl shares stories of Kateaposs youth in her book Kate: The Future Queen, during which she claims Kate had hectic week of partying, meeting her aposuniversity parents - older pupils who were in charge of looking after freshers - finding her way around town and settling into her residence hall. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.Click here to sign up.Kate soon found her way around and was often seen relaxing in the common room, curled up in an armchair, a cup of tea in hand, either reading newspaper articles her father rather touchingly mailed to her or getting to know her fellow hall mates. Prince William also studied at the university and arrived the following week.He moved into the flat above Kateaposs and it didnapost take him long to notice the stunning brunette - probably because of the nickname she was given by her peers. According to Katie, she had been dubbed aposBeautul Kateapos by the end of Freshersapos Week.She writes: She was initially more reserved than many of the other young women, but her natural beauty was apparent. Tanned from a recent holiday in Barbados with her parents, fit from regular early morning run or swim, and dressed in her comfortable Hennes jeans, fitted sweater and signature cowboy boots, she radiated an outer freshness and an inner confidence. William reportedly worked up the courage to ask her to join him and his friends for breakfast one day. Of the moment, royal author Tom Quinn said: One of the funny stories is he was so desperate to meet her that as he walked towards her, he apparently tripped and said, aposOh thataposs a terrible start, youaposre going to think Iaposm a complete clot. Walks to class brought the pair together and it wasnapost long before their friendship turned into something more. This year, the pair will be celebrating their th wedding anniversary, surrounded by their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Landlord Phil Tewkesley, , made the shocking discoveries after he was able to remove the occupants who he claimed had been refusing to go for months.When he finally was able to enter the bungalow he found it full of rubbish including the four snakes - two dead and two alive - fish, bugs crawling across the carpets and even a scorpion and tarantula, reported LancsLive. The tenant was allegedly an animal lover who had rescued the snakes and other creatures. The landlord has now shared shocking footage of the trashed home, near Kendal, and the abandoned creatures.  Phil, from Worsley, said: It was unbelievable, the sheer volume of not just belongings but actual rubbish and food. Iaposve never seen anything like it in my le - it was like a rubbish dump with a roof on it. The neighbours said they were hoarders - they got deliveries every day and never threw anything out. There was mould growing from the carpet and it was full of urine, mealworms - you name it, it was rotten. There was also evidence in a number of spots of rodent damage and a bit of an infestation with holes gnawed through places around the house. The daughteraposs room was the worst - my partner Lisa cleared that and had to run out of the house heaving and retching numerous times because of the stench of urine. I saw this huge tank and it was dirty. I looked a bit closer into the tank and got the shock of my le - there was this gigantic snake curled up.I was terried, I screamed and ran out of the house because the shock of seeing something like that was unbelievable. Phil issued a formal notice for the tenants to vacate the bungalow upon histo the UK in late , after living abroad for six years. But the couple, who lived in the property with their teen daughter, didnapost leave for another year, it is reported. Phil, an HR manager, gained access to his property in December last year and then made the grim discovery that the entire three-bedroom house was piled high with rubbish and housing both dead and live exotic animals. He phoned the RSPCA and left a spare key with the neighbours, allowing them to come and collect the aposgiganticapos snake. The RSPCA officers also called the police, who sent an officer to witness the recovery of the animals.Once they were removed, the locks were changed and the tenant was given a month to remove the rest of his belongings before the clean up could begin. It took the landlord, his partner Lisa McCartney, , and some friends around  stomach-churning hours to clear all of the rubbish and rip the soiled carpets out. Phil said: I initially hired three skips - at £ each - and we filled them in one day, followed by another two which were full to the brim as well. I also had to pay for the council to do a large collection of the sofa and kitchen appliances because they were rotten. It cost about £, just to get rid of their stuff and the stuff theyaposd wrecked and itaposs going to cost tens of thousands to get it back to how it should have been. Itaposs been a really stressful period, trying to get him to leave and then to find what I found. Weaposre getting married at the end of this year so itaposs something we really didnapost need to have to deal with. Phil, who said he felt the new rule, introduced due to Covid, of giving tenants six months to find somewhere new to live was aposfairapos, setting the vacation deadline at April .  But in January of that year, he got the first hint that something was wrong at the property when his application to release capital from the bungalow to help fund a new house deposit was rejected due to the state of the property. A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: We can confirm that four snakes - two sadly dead and two alive - were removed from a property in [Cumbria] by the RSPCA following a report from a member of the public. The live snakes were rehomed at a specialist boarding facility. As there is now a live investigation, we are not able to provide any further information at the moment.

The video emerged from King’s Leadership Academy in Dingle Vale, Liverpool. Filmed by an anonymous student, it shows pupils trying to catch the rodent as it races between tables in the school’s cafeteria,The Liverpool Echo reported .Nicola Kelley has two children who attend the school, she said: It has been going on since before half term, when my kids were telling me about it, I didnapost believe it at first until I saw some of the videos. I thought that they would have fixed the problem over the school break, but obviously they havenapost.  I got in contact with them to tell them my concerns, and they came back to say that they saw two mice before the break, and that they thought the students were being dramatic, and that it wasnapost as bad as they were making out. The footage, filmed on March , shows only a single rodent racing around, but there were said to be “multiple” mice running around. The -year-old mum added: My daughter said that she saw at least five mice in the hall which is just outside the canteen yesterday [March ].  “I have had to start making them packed lunches, I donapost want them eating from in there. I ended chemo in November and finished radiotherapy in January, I am terried about my kids bringing any diseases home that these pests could carry, I donapost want to catch anything. The Echo also reported that two further mice were spotted at the school earlier.  A spokesperson for the King’s Leadership Academy Liverpool added: There was an incident last week where a mouse was seen within the canteen and our estate management team dealt with it immediately and the mouse was caught. Covid protocols requiring us to keep doors and windows open for ventilation presents challenges, particularly during the winter months, to stop incidents like this from happening.

Darci Topping, a qualied nursery nurse, started work at Stepping Stones Nursery in the Lancashire village of Hoddlesden in February . A week later she told her line manager she was pregnant.The  year old - who was on minimum wage - was then subjected to aposnegative inferencesapos about her pregnancy by her managers, was quizzed about the babyaposs father and about her intention to go through with the birth. She was also apospressuredapos into reducing her hours as the Covid- pandemic hit and then made redundant out of the blue, the employment tribunal heard.But bosses at Stepping Stones Nursery had aposdressed upapos her sacking with a sham process because she was pregnant, the tribunal ruled.  Miss Topping, who now has one-year-old son Stanley, has been awarded £, after she successfully sued the nursery at an employment tribunal for pregnancy discrimination and unfair dismissal. The tribunal in Manchester was told qualied nursery nurse started at the nursery near Blackburn on February  in  on a -hour-a-week contract. A week later, on March , Miss Topping, from Blackburn, announced to her line manager Zara Costello that she was pregnant with her first child. A tribunal report said: A few days later, in the course of a discussion about her pregnancy, Ms Costello told her that Julie Mercer, the owner of the nursery, would aposcome round to itapos, and she mentioned the fact that Miss Topping was on probation. Other comments were made, including questions about whether Miss Topping was, in fact, going to keep the baby and whether that would be a good idea, and reference was made to Miss Toppingaposs partner or father of the baby at the time. As the Covid- pandemic hit days later and Stepping Stones Nursery became worried about finances, Miss Topping was told her hours needed to be cut to  a week and wasnapost given any consultation. She was forced to sign a aposhastilyapos typed up document agreeing to cutting her hours - but was the only worker to have her shts formally cut. Miss Topping was aposanxiousapos over the pandemicaposs impact on her health and whether or not she would have a job, the tribunal heard. She was placed on sick leave initially but then placed on furlough as well as other members of staff. However, she was the only one to receive  per cent of wages for  hours a week, rather than . Despite things being aposstableapos at the nursery, she was made redundant out of the blue while on furlough, leaving her aposvery upsetapos. Ms Costello even suggested she aposmight be better off on benefitsapos during the telephone call. The report said: By April , , the numbers of children attending the nursery each day had stabilised. Miss Topping was by then on furlough with other employees at no cost to the nursery. What happened then was that Ms Costello simply rang up Miss Topping and announced her dismissal as .From the evidence presented, the Tribunal considered that the nursery dressed up her dismissal by constructing a redundancy process which either never took place or took place after the nursery made its decision to dismiss her. Miss Topping launched legal action, claiming the nursery aposhad a problem with pregnant employeesapos. Employment Judge Marion Batten said: The Tribunal concluded that the decision to make her redundant was a decision targeted at her alone - she was pregnant and in light of the paucity of the evidence, it was apparent that was the only dference. There was no other credible explanation offered by the nursery. The tribunal had no hesitation in concluding that her dismissal was related to her pregnancy. Only she was dismissed. She was the only employee who was pregnant, and in the context of her treatment by the nursery since she told them, at the beginning of March , that she was pregnant. Following the case, Miss Stanley said she is aposglad to have won the tribunalapos. She added: It was very tough for me being made redundant at such a vulnerable point in my le while expecting my first baby which I wanted to be excited about. I do feel that I have got justice and I am relieved that the case is finally over.

It had been suggested that Harry and Meghan wanted to compromise with a one foot in, one foot out solution to being working royals and chasing their own financial deals.However, following the so-called Sandringham Summit between Harry, the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, it was decided they should cut ties completely.And now former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt says more could have been done to keep Harry and Meghan in the Firm - especially as Meghan could have been an asset to them. He told the: She was able to give a speech in South Africa about being a woman of colour who entered an institution that, to survive and prosper, needs to continue being the head of state in several other realms which are Commonwealth countries, and it failed to do enough to keep her within the institution.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

They’ve managed to find a mechanism whereby [civilian] Prince Edward can attend the Cenotaph wearing a military unorm. They could have found a mechanism whereby Harry could have carried on. The fact that they didn’t smacks of a level of cruelty.”His comments come as Harry made a surprise appearance at a Texas rodeo - and came dressed for the occasion wearing a cowboy hat. Harry was spotted at the Stockyards Rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas, on Saturday - a famous rodeo where contestants ride bulls and take part in roping competitions. He was at the event without Meghan and was seen chatting to people attending the rodeo and was given a tour of the venue.Harryaposs appearance at the rodeo comes two weeks after his and Meghanaposs last public outing at the NAACP Image Awards, where they were awarded the prestigious Presidentaposs Award to mark their special achievement for aposdistinguished public serviceapos.Accepting the award, Harry said: I think itaposs safe to say that I come from a very dferent background from my incredible we, yet our lives were brought together for a reason. We share a commitment to a le of service, a responsibility to combat injustice and a belief that the most often overlooked are the most important to listen to. The couple also offered their support to the people of Ukraine amid the Russian invasion and Harry explained: Before I begin, we would like to acknowledge the people of Ukraine, who urgently need our continued support as a global community.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old Coldstream Guardsman quit his role in Windsor to take up arms fighting Vladimir Putin ’s forces in eastern Europe.The teenager is one of several Brits believed to have deserted their posts to join the war effort. Ministry of Defenceagents are believed to be attempting to find the teenager over fears Russia could see the soldier signing up as Britain joining the fighting.The move potentially threatens to undo progress made by the West to avoid the dire situation unravelling into a worldwide conflict.A source told The Sun he wrote to his parents before going AWOL.Follow the latest in Ukraine on our live blog  The insider said: “He’d had enough. He got promised a tour to Afghanistan, same as a lot of other lads after all the ceremonial stuff. But that didn’t happen. “A lot of the lads are fed up. They were promised an operational tour and it got pushed under their noses for about three or four years. Then when the tour was supposed to come about, it got cancelled. “He probably thinks he could do some good out there but it’s a very misguided decision.” Several of the army’s top brass has slammed the teen’s decision to leave his post.It comes as Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC she supported Brits going to fight in Ukraine. She said: “That is something people can make their own decisions about. “The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe. “Absolutely,people want to support that struggle I would support them in doing that.”Defence secretary Ben Wallace later claried only Brits with military experience and who are no longer in the British Armed Forces should consider joining the war effort. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier called on soldiers around the world to boost his army’s numbers by creating an “international legion”. Last week he revealed more than , foreigners had volunteered to fight. He said: “We have nothing to lose but our own freedom.” A spokesman for the MOD said: “All Service Personnel are prohibited from travelling to Ukraine until further notice. “This applies whether the Service Person is on leave or not. Personnel travelling to Ukraine will face disciplinary and administrative consequences.” Buckingham Palace was approached for comment.

Syllipsimopodi bideni was armed with two more limbs than its descendants today. It roamed the oceans  million years ago. Additional appendages would have made it a more efficient predator, say the team at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.The species was unearthed at the Mississippian Bear Gulch in Montana - one of the best preserved fossil sites in the world.It was a primitive vampire squid. They do not suck or drink blood but have dark skin that connects the arms - resembling a cape. The discovery sheds fresh light on evolution - pushing back the age of the group by nearly  million years.What do you make of squid Joe Biden  Have your say in the comment section Lead author Dr Christopher Whalen said: This is the first and only known vampyropod to possess ten al appendages. The paper was submitted for publication in Nature Communications around the time of the  year-old US presidentaposs inauguration. Dr Whalen said: I wanted to somehow acknowledge the moment in a way that was more positive and forward-looking. I was encouraged by the plans President Biden put forward to counter anthropogenic climate change, and his general sentiment that politicians should listen to scientists. Vampyropods are the ancestors of vampire squid and octopae. Their origins are unclear. Modern descendants have eight arms and two big eyes - enabling them to survive in pitch black waters near the bottom of the ocean. Octopae and squid can reach  and  feet long respectively - and weigh half a ton.  S. bideni was less than five inches showing they started out small - before becoming very big. Its remains are exceptionally important. The soft-bodied nature of cephalopods mean they rarely fossilise. Co-author Professor Neil Landman said: Syllipsimopodi may have filled a niche more similar to modern squids, a mid-level aquatic predator. It is not inconceivable it might have used its sucker-laden arms to pry small ammonoids out of their shells or ventured more inshore to prey on brachiopods, bivalves or other shelled marine animals. S. bideni was dug up in the s and donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada where it has resided ever since - without previously being described. After scanning the specimen Dr Whalen and Prof Landman realised it was a completely new genus - and the oldest cephalopod on record. It corroborates previous arguments that their common ancestor had ten arms.Dr Whalen said: The arm count is one of the defining characteristics separating the -armed squid and cuttlefish line from the eight armed octopus and vampire squid line. We have long understood that octopuses achieve the eight arm count through elimination of the two filaments of vampire squid, and that these filaments are vestigial arms. However, all previously reported fossil vampyropods preserving the appendages only have  arms. So this fossil is arguably the first confirmation of the idea that all cephalopods ancestrally possessed ten arms. Two of S. bideniaposs arms appear to have been elongated relative to the other eight. Its torpedo-shaped body is reminiscent of todayaposs squids. The genus name is Greek for aposprehensile footapos because it is the oldest known cephalopod to develop suckers. They allowed the arms - modications of the molluscan foot - to better grasp prey and other objects. Added Dr Whalen: The findings present a revised and more detailed analysis of vampyropod evolution than previously possible. Joe Biden was inaugurated on  January last year. He is the th president of the United States. A host of strange animals have been named after his predecessors - including the tiny moth Neopalpa donaldtrumpi. The insectaposs yellow-and-white crown bore a striking resemblance to Donald J. Trumpaposs distinctive cofure. Baracktrema obamai is a species of flatworm that is meant to honour Barack Obama. The parasitic wasp Heterospilus washingtoni is named after George Washington, a tiny shrew Heterospilus washingtoni hails Theodore Roosevelt - and there is the bluegrass darter Etheostoma jimmycarter. Others include the beaded darter Etheostoma clinton after Bill Clinton and the wasp Heterospilus reagani after Ronald Reagan.

Probably some bus services affected with some journeys taking longer.”  Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said: “Windy on Wednesday with gales towards the north west and also some heavy rain. Dry skies towards the south and the east.” She continued: “We could see severe gales for a time as the strongest winds extend to the far north of Scotland. We could even see some damaging gust across the east side of Northern Ireland again through the morning associated with that rain band with some heavy bursts.” At the same time it is likely to be a dry start to Wednesday across England and Wales before the rain moves in.  “This rain gradually pushes in and again these winds will be incredibly strong particularly through the north channel, said Ms Nasir. Now the cloud will come and go across England and Wales as well as eastern Scotland but some brighter weather, even some sunshine across eastern counties during the day. At the same time rain will slowly clip western part of Wales as well as the West Country, hanging onto that wet weather for Northern Ireland as well as western Scotland and an undercut of cold air will allow snow to fall especially above m. So west will see the strongest winds, outbreaks of rain, east temperatures will be C to C.  Maps from WXCharts shows that a couple of centimetres of snow can be expected in Scotland overnight going into Thursday.And BBC weather forecaster Nick Miller has also predicted snow that will come along with the gales.“Some severe gales, gusts up to -mph, could be disruptive before they ease,” he said.  This weather system weakens moving east over night and into Thursday on its back edge it will have some some snow towards the Highlands and southern uplands for a time. In the clear spells in north west Scotland and Northern Ireland as Thursday begins there will be a frost here and especially in Northern Ireland there is a risk of seeing some fog. UK forecast for the next  days Wet and windy in the west, drier in the east. Today: Low cloud across central, southern and eastern England breaking to allow sunny spells. A band of rain, heavy at times, will move slowly eastwards across Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and then western England. Severe gales across western Scotland at first. Tonight: Outbreaks of rain across some northern and western parts, though rain turning lighter and patchier. Dry with clear spells in the southeast, and also the far northwest where turning frosty. Thursday: Cloudy across many parts with patchy light rain and drizzle edging slowly eastwards. Brighter across some western areas. Turning windy in the west later. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Rather unsettled with outbreaks of rain at times for most parts of the UK, heaviest and most prolonged in western areas. Strong winds at times, especially along western coastal areas.

When asked by her followers how she ended up living in the accommodation, the woman explained that the town decided to open up the free apartments due to a lack of rental properties in the area. Because of the nature of my job, I need to be at work. And I travel a lot but it was impossible to find housing. So this town has a lot of people who come here for that reason, and they had no housing other than low income, she explained. So they started allowing people to live in their old folks home because it was one of their only rental units that would have openings. There’s a tech school in town and there’s a handful of about three or four people my age that live here, but  percent of the people that live here are still old folks because they live here since before the city bought it and allowed other people to live here.

The ‘Turkey and Beef Duo Sunday Roast’ was served at the Greene King owned Channings Hotel in Bristol and cost one unlucky diner £..Remaining anonymous, they said that the image on the menu looked great, but the food that was brought out was very disappointing. They got three overdone potatoes, just one piece of caullower cheese, and an odd-shaped chunk of stuffing in a Yorkshire pudding - alongside overcooked meat. What do you think about the roast dinner  Let us know in the comments... A barrister, who uploads to Twitter as WelshGirlAbroad, said that her student daughter was given the depressing looking dish while out with her friends, and she shared a photo of the meal - which was met with dismay - online.She wrote: So this is what Greene King serves by way of award-winning roast dinner at Channings in Bristol. She was with three friends. They didn’t like to complain, thought they’d be assumed to be students trying it on.  They’d had to pay in advance on an app. I’ve seen better in hospital. Soon she was inundated with comments from people who agreed that the food served looked terrible. Linda Caswell wrote: Iaposve just come out of hospital and the food was great. Their chicken dinner knocked this into a cocked hat.” Chris Dale replied: There’s not much our dog would decline to eat, but I think you’ve found it. Mark Savage said: That is not a roast.

She added: They apparently need up to seven days to decide whether it was acceptable to serve this or not. The response had best be worth the wait.

Josephine, from San Diego, Calornia, said: I always wanted to have a house of my own so I could give Jojo his own room. We have always lived in an apartment and moved around a lot but finally last year we got our own house with a garden.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Jojo has so many things that I’ve always said it’s Jojoaposs house - I’m just here to pay the rent for him.

While another added: Those Lego sculptures are giving me le!  A third said: I love it! You have the coolest room ever! Josephineaposs other corgi, Kilo, can be spotted in some of the portraits in Jojoaposs room. and often spends time in there playing alongside his four-legged brother.Known as the aposworldaposs first surfing corgiapos, Josephine introduced Jojo to the waves five years ago as a way to help him regain his mental and physical strength after being injured in a dog attack.The vets were unsurehe would survive due to the severity of his injuries, said Josephine. Not one to back down from a challenge, Jojo was determined to come back stronger than ever. This is where his love for surfing and the beach blossomed. In order to recover from his injuries, veterinarians suggested water therapy as a solution to keep pressure off his atrophied muscles. He recovered quickly and even started surfing. After he had fully recovered, he was ready to take on a new role in the world. Between spending time in his new room and at the beach, Jojo volunteers as a certied therapy dog.

Upcoming tax rises, soaring energy bills and inflation has only added to peopleaposs financial worries, and now rising oil prices will add to the anguish of the cost of living crisis. Diesel has been averaging a whopping £. a litre, while petrol is now .p - and as the war in Ukraine continues, the dficulties are only likely to get worse. The government has already been criticised for not doing enough about the crisis, particularly Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs scheme to ease the pain of energy bills with a council tax rebate and £ loan.So what is the government doing about this crisis and why are fuel prices so high  Simply, oil prices are rising because it is more in demand and this has been made worse by the war in Ukraine.There were already shortages that sent fuel skyrocketing last year and now businesses are cutting off ties to Russian oil. This means that the current crisis could well get worse - and more expensive.The UK only gets around -% of its crude oil from Russia and a  Autocar report estimates around % of UK diesel is from the country. This is not the same for much of Europe - around half of the barrels of oil Russia produces every day goes to the continent, with the country the worldaposs third-biggest supplier of oil. The UK is hoping to totally phase out the use of Russian oil by the end of . The EU is far more reliant on oil and has so far committed to drop its usage by around two-thirds. With countries turning away from Russian oil, there is demand for it where, which pushes the prices up. What is the government doing about the rise in oil prices   The government is hoping that a phasing out of Russian oil will help businesses in the UK adjust to the crisis, along with more reliance on its oil reserves and partner states. Due to its commitment to imposing sanctions on Ukraine, it has warned that both oil and gas prices will rise as a result.Yesterday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: The government will also work with companies through a new Taskforce on Oil to support them to make use of this period in finding alternative supplies.The UK is a signicant producer of oil and oil products, plus we hold signicant reserves. Beyond Russia, the vast majority of our imports come from reliable partners such as the US, Netherlands and the Gulf. Since the record rise in prices for people at the pumps, there have been calls for the chancellor to cut VAT on fuel.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: These hikes are unprecedented and will sadly be hitting both homes and businesses hard. Itaposs therefore vital the chancellor acts quickly to limit the damage by cutting VAT to at least %, which would save drivers .p a litre and take the average price of unleaded back under £.. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady, meanwhile, called for a windfall tax on oil companies to invest in renewable energy. Oil companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and Total have boasted huge profits this year, as working families struggle. She said: No-one wants to see UK energy imports paying for Putin’s illegal war against Ukraine. But working people will need [the] government to support them over the coming months. That means help for energy-intensive industries to keep energy supplies affordable and jobs safe. And it means help for working families to keep energy bills affordable. The best way to do this is with a windfall tax on soaring energy profits. And the government should accelerate public investment in decarbonising industry, renewables and nuclear, and insulating our homes, to reduce Putinaposs power.

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

Caroline Wortman, , discovered she was nearly ten weeks pregnant with her second child, Brooks, just six months after the birth of her first daughter, one-year-old Josie.This came after she was told that she may be infertile after being diagnosed with uterine didelphys, meaning she was born with two reproductive systems. Caroline said: Having children was always something I knew I wanted, but I just tried to stay positive and not dwell too much on it. Infertile was the story that I told myself for ten years. But after seven months of trying, Caroline became pregnant with Josie, and found out she was pregnant again just six months after her birth. Have you got an incredible story to tell  Email webnews@mirrorHer first ultrasound told her that her son was growing in the other uterus. Josie was in the right, Brooks was in the left said Caroline, from Woodstock, Georgia. For women with my specic diagnosis I just hope that this is one story that they can turn to and say aposlook, this girl was told no and she had two healthy babies in one yearapos, she said. Uterine Didelphys is caused because when a female foetus is growing, the uterus starts out as two small tubes called Mllerian ducts. These will eventually fuse together to form the reproductive system in a process called embryogenesis.  Women with uterine didelphys do not undergo full embryogenesis, and can be born with two full reproductive systems. Caroline was  when she had her first appointment with the gynaecologist who, after completing the exam, told her that she had two cervixes. She said: I honestly shrugged it off because I didnapost really realize what the implications could be. I did ask the doctor what having two cervixes meant and remember her telling me that I may be infertile andI did become pregnant, it would likely be complicated and high risk. I think this took years and meeting my husband to really sink in, but it was always in the back of my mind.  A couple of months later she went for an internal ultrasound where it was confirmed that she had two complete uteruses, and was diagnosed with uterine didelphys. She was also told that it may be dficult for her to get pregnant in the future. Caroline, who works for a law firm, said: I always knew I wanted to be a mum, I just wasnapost sure that I would be able to without adoption, surrogacy or some other intervention. As she grew up, her diagnosis did not affect her le, but things changed when she met her now-husband Nate Daniel Wortman, , when she was . The couple were married in September  and very quickly started trying for a family.  She said: I didnapost know how long it may take,at all. I was worried but you always hear worrying makes getting pregnant harder, so we just tried to be happy and relaxed as newlyweds about the whole thing.She found out she was pregnant in April .Her uterus that was not carrying her baby was simply pushed aside as it grew, and little Josie Magnolia Wortman was born on January  at a healthy six pounds.The family-of-three spent a happy six months as just that, before Caroline started feeling nauseous while out at lunch with her parents the following June.We were giggly with excitement but also still terried. The visual communications graduate said. The couple had not been trying for a second baby, but at her next appointment Caroline discovered she was already almost ten weeks along - and the baby was growing in her other uterus. She said: The baby was small enough each time to see the other uterus and confirm which side the baby was in - Josie was in the right, Brooks was in the left. Brooks Daniel Hayes Wortman was born on Boxing Day  weighing just lbs oz, and remained in the NICU for nine days.  She shared her unique pregnancy story on TikTok, which now has over , views in order to raise awareness of fertility struggles.She said: Being infertile and thinking you will be infertile are two drastically dferent things, but I would just encourage women to not give upthey want to become mothers, and to not take a doctoraposs words as the be all and end all. I donapost remember really coming across any relatable stories with my specic diagnosis during my pregnancy, so I hope this can be that to at least one woman.

It was obvious he had set himself a goal. More likely he had understood that he had to achieve something in his le. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blogBefore this, a fellow teacher told Vera that she regarded Putin as sneaky and disorganised but Gurevich said she immediately spotted that he would make something of himself. In the book, Putin said he enjoyed school as long as he managed to be the unspoken leader, meaning he didnapost try to command people and remained independent. But he realised that he needed to improve his social status - and began playing sports, alongside trying harder in his classes. Vera helped Putin improve, as she began to shower him with attention and discourage him from hanging around the streets with a wayward pair of brothers. But while other pupils enjoyed attending dances, Putin avoided attending and didnapost like socialising in favour of attending judo classes four times a week. He told the bookaposs authors: When I began to do sports...I used to work out every other day and then every day. Soon I had no time for anything . I had other priorities, I had to prove myself in sports, achieve something, I set goals. The pair grew very close, with Vera becoming a second mother to him, even taking him on holiday. She told the bookaposs authors in : I think [Putin] is a good person. But he never forgives people who betray him or are mean to him.In an interview with the BBC today Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it was clear President Vladimir Putin was a “spent force”. He said the Russian leader would not break the people of Ukraine and that he now potentially faced decades of occupation which would be impossible to sustain.“Whatever we think about President Putin, he is done. He is a spent force in the world. No-one will be taking his phone calls in the long term,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “He has exhausted his army, he is responsible for thousands of Russian soldiers being killed, responsible for innocent people being killed, civilians being killed in Ukraine. “He is reducing his economy to zero, because the international community has decided that is absolutely unacceptable, what he’s done. “So he is a spent force in the world and I don’t know whether he thinks that’s a clever thing to be, but that diminishes his own country in the world and he has to take responsibility for that.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationRussia Ukraine warVladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The huge convoy of tanks and vehicles has been stuck on roads positioned around  miles from Ukraine ’s capital for several days amid claims of mechanical issues and empty fuel tanks.The weapons of death could become tombs for Russian soldiers in the coming days with conditions set to drop to -C at night - and even colder with the added windchill factor. Putin’s Moscow fighters are not equipped for severe cold war fighting.Former British Army Major Kevin Price told MailOnline the invaders’ tanks will become “-ton freezers” for those still inside, which will destroy morale.Glen Grant, a senior defence expert at the Baltic Security Foundation, said the Russians inside the convoy may have to surrender to avoid freezing to death.Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog He told Newsweek: “You just canapost sit around and wait becauseyou are in the vehicle you are waiting to be killed. They are not stupid. Reports have been heard of Putin’s troops overheard complaining about the war in calls to family and friends back home. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.On Sunday, February , Ukraineaposs health minister reported that at least  Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than , wounded. On March , Ukraine claimed to have killed , Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently veried but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than  civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least  people have been killed, including  children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. It comes as Ukraineaposs President accused Russia of aposstate terrorismapos on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv.  While the soldiers shiver in sub-zero conditions, the falling temperatures will also cause a nightmare for Ukraine’s refugees. Forced out of their homes by constant Russian shelling, the plummeting conditions could cause the current humanitarian crisis in the country to worsen still further.  Some cities, including Mariupol in the south east, currently have no power, water or heat, leading to fears those still inside their ravaged homes could die without help. Yesterday it was reported a six-year-old girl died from dehydration alone, weak, frightened, thirsty in the besieged city of Mariupol. Her tragic death came after spending days with no water, power or heating supplies. Last week Russian forces cornered the port city with constant airstrikes, leaving residents without energy and water, with no way to evacuate. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyannounced the childaposs death this morning in a video address and officials later said her name was Tanya.Likening the humanitarian crisis linked to Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities to that created by the Nazi invasion during World War Two, he said sadly: “In , from dehydration.” The cityaposs mayor, Vadym Boychenko, later said: “Her mother was killed. We don’t know how long the girl was fighting for her le.  We can’t imagine how much suffering she had to bear. In the last minutes of her le she was alone, weak, frightened, thirsty.”Skyaposs weather producer Jo Robinson added: Overnight lows of -C are forecast for parts of the east - especially Kharkiv.It could feel like -C at night with the wind chill. The cold will be extensive across Ukraine, but the lowest temperatures seem to be in the east. It looks like the cold spell will last into the weekend.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen

was later mobilised to North Africa where he was awarded the Military Medal at the Battle of Longstop Hill. He was commissioned in the field in Africa.Later advancing through Italy, Germany and Austria, he ended his service in an Austrian town called Dolsech, after which his home in Campbeltown is named.During discussions on his war service with Lt Col Donald Ross OBE and Col Robert Steele, it became apparent that he had not been awarded the Territorial Decoration to which he was entitled.The army medals office was approached and it was agreed MajMcMillan should receive this honour and he was awarded the Territorial Medal in the Queen’s New Year’s Honours List.At a ceremony last week, his family joined him, including son James who travelled from Canada to witness the medal presentation at the former RAF airbase at Machrihanish.Major McMillan said: #I am delighted to see some of my oldest friends here and as well as receiving this medal, it has made my day.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOIslay’s Ardbeg Distillery has been bought by Glenmorangie plc for £ million.Allied Domecq plc, which owned Ardbeg Distillery, will receive £ million of the total sum in tranches within the next three years.The sale includes the Ardbeg brand, the distillery and surrounding land as well as the stock profile which will come on stream as Ardbeg -year-old and -year-old stocks mature.It will signicantly strengthen Glenmorangie’s current portfolio of malt whiskies which include Glenmorangie and Glen Moray and will provide excellent potential for new brand development, utilising the company’s proven experience in premium brand management.Commenting on the acquisition, Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman of Glenmorangie plc, said: #The company has made signicant progress since the introduction of a new strategy in .#We are particularly confident that our existing portfolio will continue to deliver above average growth and we wish to exploit our marketing capability to achieve a similar success rate with this Islay malt.#An opportunity such as Ardbeg, in a segment of the market which remains under developed, provides us with a rare opportunity.#Glenmorangie is well positioned in the Scotch whisky market, with a strong presence in the malt sector which grew by . per cent in the year to October  in export markets and by  per cent from January to October .FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Lachlan McKinnon, the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist officer, this week reported bumper bookings for the coming season.Talking to a Courier man, Mr McKinnon said that there had been a tremendous boom in the self-catering type of holiday.In fact, the association’s list of cottages, chalets and so on has become exhausted with the result that the months of June, July, August up until the middle of September are fully booked.A total of , enquiries were dealt with in the association’s Campbeltown headquarters by the end of February, an increase of  on last year.Mr McKinnon said he hoped the upward trend in self-catering holidays would continue further and preparations would be made to meet with the demand.It is hoped that the Arran-Kintyre ferry service proposed for this summer will be successful.Mr McKinnon’s plan is to bombard the landing jetty at Claonaig with advertising literature in an attempt to induce motorists south to Campbeltown.He feels strongly that the local authority, hoteliers and businessmen should spend more on advertising nationally in an all-out effort to attract tourism to the burgh.‘Unfortunately the tourist association does not have the money to advertise a specic place.

National Union of Mineworkers and he acts with full approval of the National Coal Board.The strike was in sympathy with two backsht men who walked out because they alleged that part of the pit, where

laundry and ironing service, with pick-up and delivery included.‘We had been looking for new premises for some time and the unit has everything we need,’ said Joan Stewart, Shopper-Aide project manager.The building has been altered to suit Shopper-Aide’s needs, with the creation of a reception office space, a group meeting room, a private office and accessible toilets, in addition to the laundry room that was already in the building.There is also a kitchen where Shopper-Aide hopes to make soup which will be sold to the public twice a week.While there are still some small additions to be made to the building, Joan said Andrew Smith, Shopper-Aide’s new landlord, and local tradesmen who have carried out work so far, have been ‘brilliant’ in helping get things up and running.When Shopper-Aide was first set up, to help people aged  and over with their grocery shopping, it was dependent on external funders to operate and pay staff salaries.Over the years, as it began to offer more services including household support, a befriending service and organising social clubs like Elderberries and Garry’s Gang according to clients’ needs and abilities, the charity introduced new initiatives to help generate its own funds.These include selling crafts created by clients at its art and crafts clubs and donated second-hand books and other items.The importance of Shopper-Aide has been highlighted during the Covid pandemic, with its outstanding work in the community earning it a Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service, the UK#s highest award for volunteers.During the first lockdown, the charity’s shopping client-base more than doubled, but an influx of volunteers who were unable to work due to Covid restrictions supported the charity to cope with the increased demand.Volunteers also helped Shopper-Aide to continue providing entertainment to older people throughout lockdown, despite not being able to hold its regular groups, by organising virtual afternoon teas and quizzes and a poetry competition.A ‘Phone Buddies’ system was also set-up, offering one-to-one phone-calls to clients.The charity encouraged its clients to knit squares as part of its ‘lockdown blankets’ project. These were then sewed into blankets which have been donated to three dferent charities to help homeless people.‘During lockdown, it was brought to our attention that it wasn’t only older people with dficulties who struggled,’ Joan said. ‘Everyone felt loneliness.‘To that end, we want to invite everyone, including older people, to come and help us at Shopper-Aide, to help support their community.‘Our volunteers come from all walks of le and are truly tremendous. We wouldn’t be where we are today without them.‘Just an hour a week of someone’s spare time would make an amazing dference to us.’Shopper-Aide is looking for volunteers across all areas of the charity’s work, although it should be noted that people must be aged  or over to drive Shopper-Aide’s vehicles.Garry’s Gang, a men-only group that meets twice a week, was the first to resume when Covid restrictions allowed.One attendee told Shopper-Aide staff: ‘I’m not going to die of Covid, I’m going to die of loneliness.’That is why the charity is keen to restart its social groups as soon as possible, initially in bubbles to ensure safety.‘The last two years, we’ve been on hold, the same the rest of society,’ said Joan, ‘but we’re starting to open our wings and are looking forward to getting back to the new normal.’Shopper-Aide has three full-time and  part-time staff who assist and coordinate volunteers.‘Our staff are very committed,’ Joan said. ‘They all do a brilliant job and go above and beyond what’s asked of them.‘The Shopper-Aide family is committed to supporting each other, and we want to become more resilient should something like Covid ever happen again.’As well as volunteering, people can also support the charity by becoming a ‘Shopper-Aide Friend’ by donating £ a year infor newsletters and the knowledge that they’re supporting a charity within the community.Call   or visit Shopper-Aide’s website or Facebook page for more information on the new laundry service or to support the charity."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 4 2022","story":"We have recently moved to Carradale, and are loving it!I wrote this poem in praise of our new home.Carradale, O Carradale,Room to stretch, peace to workThe south might say it’s grim up northMay our days be long and all spent hereI urge you alltired and stressedThe story’s just startingTo quote a French poet, Charles Baudelaire,Best wishes.Living in a Campbeltown flat, one up from the street, with only one flat above using the same toilet waste downpipe, I was amazed tohome to find a previous #deposit# still in my toilet.My attempt to clear and flush caused the toilet basin to fill to the brim with #dirty# water etcetera and white paper.The emergency plumbers were called and two good men arrived but efforts to clear the toilet basin in the flat failed.At ground level outside, they effected an entry into the said downpipe and pulled out unpleasant #deposits# and many many wet wipes – which I do not use.They claimed to have previously attended similarly choked toilets with wet wipes.

Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

builds at the end of last year, with more than £, set aside for a full-size pitch and changing facilities.Councillor Norman Hampshire, council leader and ward member, revealed that that was just part of the proposals being brought forward, with the scheme tying in with nearby Hallhill Sports Centre.He said: “We are looking to create a new pump track and skate park along with changing rooms for the football pitch and a community cafe.“It would be a multi-generational facility however, in the evening it will be available for the young people to use.“They can come and watch television, potentially have a game of pool or other activities.”Funding is already in place for ious aspects of the ambitious project.However, there are still obstacles to be overcome.A planning application will be needed for the changing rooms, cafe, skate park and pump track.Youngsters will play a key role in the design of the skate park and pump track, with funding applications then being submitted to ious bodies.The planning application is expected to be submitted at the beginning of April, while work on the football pitch and play area could get under way within a matter of months.Mr Hampshire was hopeful,matters progressed smoothly, that work could start on the building this summer, and the skate park and pump track at the end of the year.The council leader felt that the proposed facilities would have a number of benefits to the community.He said: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing and we want to give them something positive they can do.“My own vision is the cafe will be open from am to pm and we will be the operators of it but also I would like to have youth workers basing themselves within the cafe and going out into the community where young people are.”Mr Hampshire highlighted the plans during a virtual meeting with Dunbar Community Council.He said that a lot of work was still to be done, both on the site and in

What is the best way to save energy in our homes A. If your home isn’t yet insulated, then the best way to save money is to get your loft and your cavity walls insulated. You will soon recover the money spent and there may even be a grant available to help.After that, turning your thermostat down even by  degree Celsius can help save money — andyou need to, put on another layer of clothes to keep warm.Q. Does only filling a kettle with as much water to boil as you need really help A. Every small action helps and that includes only boiling the water you need in a kettle. Heating more water than you need means you are spending money unnecessarily.And it is also financially beneficial to heat water in a kettle and then add it to a pot, for exampleyou are boiling your potatoes, as a kettle is more efficient at heating water than many stoves.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate ChangeCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charity PremiumThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidies‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it went PremiumKerbside boxes for every home to sort recycling ‘could save £m a year’ – and clean up the current dirty systemMost ReadFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityLatestUkrainian ambassador says we experienced ‘hassle’ when applying for UK visaSecond largest daily spike in diesel prices in more than two decadesBrexit not as calamitous for Ireland as feared, politicians toldSky Vegas fined almost £.m after sending recovering addicts ‘free spins’British girl who inspired first Disney princess with glasses invited to Baftas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGreen Party NI leader Clare Bailey pictured.March   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPoliticians are increasing recognising that immediate and decisive action on the climate crisis will not only influence votes — it will win votes.Indeed, for many Northern Irish voters, climate action will be one of the defining issues in the upcoming MLA elections in May.With these elections fast approaching, many candidates have already started leafleting and door-knocking. However, when a candidate knocks at your door, what questions should you ask them  More importantly, how do you know whether they are genuinely serious about what they propose To gain a deeper sense of the candidate’s knowledge and understanding of climate breakdown, begin the conversation in the context of the broader political landscape.There are currently two climate bills passing through the Northern Irish Assembly. These are subject to ongoing debates, reviews and amendments. Both bills have a target of net zero emissions. Yet while the Private Members’ Billaims for Northern Ireland to be net zero by , the Executive Billaims for .Read MoreClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsYou could therefore start by asking the following question: which bill do they support Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Given how both bills aim for Northern Ireland to be net zero, despite ying target dates, a good follow-up question would be to ask how their party hopes to achieve this. How will they get us there  What is their political strategy  What concrete steps will they take to help Northern Ireland reach net zero Northern Ireland is not only the last nation in western Europe to implement climate legislation, but we also rank th worst in the world for bioersity loss. Nature recovery is therefore integral to an ambitious climate strategy.It is therefore crucial to ask the candidate about how they plan to halt and reverse nature and bioersity loss. How will they promote regenerative agricultural practices  How will they create more spaces for nature  How will they prevent the decline — and potential extinction — of our valuable species and wildle There are also three sectors in Northern Ireland which could be uniquely affected by the climate crisis: agriculture, energy and transport. These three sectors are vastly dferent. However, what unies questions regarding the future of these sectors is the principle of ‘just transition’.‘Just transition’ is the idea that we should not moveto a low-carbon, environmentally-friendly economyit means sacricing justice or ‘fairness’. A just transition recognises that, whether it be people on low incomes or workers in the fossil fuel industry, no one should be left behind in the creation of a ‘greener’ society.To take energy as an example, fossil fuels like oil and gas remain the primary source of heat and power in Northern Ireland. We already know that fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, and they will not help us to reach climate targets. Beyond asking candidate about renewable energy systems, we must therefore go one step further.We need to ask candidates about how they will compensate for workers in polluting industries, who may find themselves without a job in a more sustainable world. What incentive schemes will they promote  How will they re-train or upskill iniduals  How will government invest in this The same is true for agricultural and transport sectors. Will there be grants or public goods for farmers who dedicate areas of land to rewilding or regenerative practices  Will there be further investment in public transport infrastructure, particularly in rural communities  How will government incentivise citizens to support ‘greener’ lestyle choices that are typically more expensive, like buying an electric car or fitting solar  at home Lastly, ask the candidate seeking your vote about what is important to you.Whether it be plastic pollution or food waste, this is an invaluable opportunity for you to ask the candidate about a specic topic that you care deeply about. This could be an ongoing problem in your local area, or a global issue which causes you concern.Raising more personal questions with candidates may subsequently elicit a more direct response from them.Elections are a rare opportunity for citizens to shape environmental policy, and focus political attention on the most defining issue of our generation: the climate crisis.Climate change will be related to every social issue on each political party’s manesto – from gender equality to healthcare.Voting for candidates who support ambitious environmental policy solutions is therefore arguably the most important action that citizens can take.Remember this when candidates come calling.Related topicsEdwin PootsClare BaileyClimate ChangeClimate BillMore On Edwin PootsFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Greens call for independent environmental agency in NI after Poots announces English office to extend its remit to Northern Ireland PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastEdwin Poots confirmed to replace Christopher Stalford for south Belfast seat PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsMost ReadFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandTwo children taken to hospital following three-car collision in west BelfastTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityLatestCovid- antibodies at record levels among UK adults, research showsUkrainians flee besieged cities as conditions worsenMother and daughter turned away from UK border after fleeing UkraineUK soldiers risk ‘dangerous situation’ by travelling to Ukraine, minister warnsHeineken and Imperial Brands latest to halt Russian operations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But more compelling is the awareness of how, just a few years ago, all of this valuable material was just dumped into holes in the ground.It’s a filthy business, but far less filthy than the alternative of landfilling the contents of our bins.Anyone who has lived near a municipal dump knows the stench, flies and rats which follow. The toxic nature of much waste means the sites are contaminated for generations, threatening groundwater and wildle.And yet,we all dump our waste into black bins, these sites must go somewhere. It is hypocritical for someone who refuses to recycle to object to a landfill site simply because it is close to their home, rather than close to someone ’s.As recently as , every year we sent , tonnes of municipal waste to landfill by last year that had fallen by %, even though the population increased in that period.Not all the reduction is because of recycling. Just over a decade ago no household waste was incinerated, but now , tonnes are sent abroad each year to be burned to make electricity.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But recycling is the key explanation for the transformation. Driven both by legislative compulsion and growing public awareness of how we are polluting our world and wasting its resources, many people now put more into their recycling bin than into the black bin.Compostable and food waste is now collected separately and used for everything from garden compost to creating gas which can power lorries or make electricity.But what happens when the recyclable material leaves our homes  It is particularly hard to understand how the recyclable items put into blue bins or other comingled recycling bins — where all manner of materials are mixed — can be accurately sorted for processing.In an industrial estate in Mallusk, Bryson Recycling is where that process unfolds for much of the east of Northern Ireland. Bin lorries from five council areas — Belfast Antrim and Newtownabbey Ards and North Down Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid and East Antrim — arrive and leave in a constant stream.Mechanical rams push out each bin lorry’s contents into a hangar. A huge quarry shovel loads it onto a conveyor belt. Plastic bottles explode like fireworks as the vehicle’s heavy wheels drive over the material.The belt carries the waste into the deafening materials recycling facility . The process which follows is surprisingly labour-intensive, as well as using technology to separate the waste.First, a group of workers stand on a raised  and manually lt obvious contaminants from the conveyor belt.Secondly, the belt moves through screens designed to remove paper, which goes to a separate line.The third process involves a magnet that attracts steel cans, such as baked beans tins.That process is then reversed at the fourth stage as the remaining material is subjected to an eddy current that repels aluminium into a chute.The line splits into four conveyors which run through a sorting cabin — the fth stage — where a team of workers pick out materials by hand, aided by a prototype robot that recognises materials and lts then.The sixth stage sees plastics removed using optical sensors which recognise material based on how it reacts to light. A final process involves a worker again manually picking out recyclable items which have been missed.By this stage, more than % of the initial material has been removed. But it’s not perfect. I saw plastic bottles and paper dropping off the end after the final check.The conveyors move quickly and not even all the obviously recyclable material can be caught there is no time to explore items which look unclear. Small items such as bottle tops are particularly unlikely to be correctly identied, falling off the end of the line to be taken for incineration.There are two forms of contamination: material which is wrongly bundled together through the MRF-sorting process [such as plastic in bales of paper], and material which cannot be recycled at all at that facility and so is taken for burning.The contamination at the start of the process stems from a mixture of ignorance of ambiguous rules for what can be recycled in dferent council areas, and deliberate flouting of rules.Claire McCallum has been in the recycling business for two decades at Bryson. “We’ve probably seen nearly everything coming through the doors here,” she tells the Belfast .“We have an ongoing issue with nappies coming through, but also dead animals all sorts of things. We’ve had quite a lot of dead lambs.”Food waste in containers rots, both making the process of hand-sorting more unpleasant and contaminating the final material.What can the public do to help  “I think the best thing people can do is, rather than look at a certain type of material and think ‘oh, that can be recycled’, always check your local council website,” she says.“And the other thing is to ensure things are clean give them a quick rinse before recycling.”But the blue bin comingled recycling is only part of what happens at this facility. Bryson’s own-design vehicles move to another part of the site where no sorting is necessary because the materials have already been sorted manually as they were lted.It is this system Ms McCallum believes is the future.It produces far higher quality materials, almost % pure, rather than some plastic or metal inevitably ending up in a bale of paper. And it uses far less energy, unlike the vast electrical and mechanical demand of the MRF plant.There isn’t just an environmental benefit to the kerbside sorting. Counterintuitively, Bryson says it is also cheaper for ratepayers.“We have been looking at cost analysis and we have worked out thatevery household in Northern Ireland had wheelie boxes, it would save councils about £ million a year,” Ms McCallum says.The costs of sorting the material properly by hand are higher, but the processing costs signicantly less and produces materials which can be sold for a much higher price.So why were councils ever using blue bins  She suspects councils instinctively did so because they had been used to bins and bin lorries, and when told to recycle, they used what was familiar.When asked about this, a spokesman for Nilga, which represents councils here, said the issue was complex, but that the public should try to consume as little materials as possible and recycle the maximum quantity of what they do use.Bryson would like to see a single, consistent approach to recycling across Northern Ireland.Another benefit of improving the quality of recycled materials is that it makes it easier to sell to local firms and improves the quality of their products.Just % of MRF-sorted material stays on the island of Ireland for processing for kerbside-sorted material that figure is %.The high quality, low-contamination materials are not possible through an MRF facility, Ms McCallum says: “You can’t achieve that through recycling through a blue bin system.”Bryson’s plastic, paper and glass is recycled locally, supporting about  jobs and generating around £m a year.The paper is turned into moulded packaging like egg cartons and cup carriers by Huhtamäki in Dollingstown. Glass is melted in a Encirc’s furnace in Derrylin before being turned into bottles for Bailey’s, Bushmills, Fever-Tree, Bottlegreen and other leading drinks brands. Plastic is taken to Cherry Pipes in Dungannon where it is made into civil engineering and agricultural pipes.In one key area, Northern Ireland is now behind the Republic.Last year it became mandatory for recycling companies south of the border to accept ‘soft plastics’ such as the film lids to be recycled.Here that form of plastic makes up much of what still goes into landfill. It is not likely to be collected for recycling locally until .Dealing with waste is complex, but it can be over-complicated by government. For years, as the government prodded people to recycle and cut black bin collections, there was public grumbling.But public opinion has shted rapidly polling now finds public support for recycling.In the post-war decades it was a symbol of society’s growing wealth that a consumer could buy something new, use it for a while and then dump it in landfill because a newer model was available or a minor fault had developed. But that materialistic hedonism has become increasingly uncool.Now people want to recycle more, and do so more easily, but it is government that has not moved to satisfy this desire — either by not collecting basic items such as soft plastic or glass for recycling, or by using a system that will inevitably fail to recover a high percentage of what could be salvaged, and will inevitably contaminate even what is recycled.Stormont and our councils have the power to change this — but may only do sothey believe votes are at stake.Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate ChangeCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charity PremiumThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidies‘A vegan diet can be healthy — but it needs planning’Aine TonerOpinionI followed a vegan diet for a week – here’s how it wentBuzz words: net zero, a key way to tackle escalating climate changeMost ReadFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandTwo children taken to hospital following three-car collision in west BelfastTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityLatestShane Warne’s state memorial to be held at Melbourne Cricket Ground on March Ukrainian ambassador says we experienced ‘hassle’ when applying for UK visaSecond largest daily spike in diesel prices in more than two decadesBrexit not as calamitous for Ireland as feared, politicians toldSky Vegas fined almost £.m after sending recovering addicts ‘free spins’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In the second half of the century, the amount of change that occurs will depend strongly on how successful we are in reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally.Annual temperatures in Northern Ireland are projected to rise by approximately .°C by the s from a - baseline average. Risks associated with rising temperatures, such as more extreme heatwave events causing impacts on people’s health, are likely to become more prevalent as a result of these projections, with their magnitude depending on the degree of change that is experienced.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the time of writing, Northern Ireland remains without a climate bill, although the expectation is that this will soon be resolved. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , led by Environment Minister Edwin Poots, and Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey have bills that have reached the consideration stage in the Assembly.Whichever bill emerges, it is clear that signicant change to our socio-economic model needs to occur to reach any of the proposed targets. In , Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be . million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Northern Ireland accounted for % of UK greenhouse gas emissions in , compared to approximately % of the UK population. Agriculture , transportand residential buildingswere the largest sectors in terms of emissions. Mindful of the need to address this and maintain a viable economy, Daera has produced a draft green growth strategy which is about creating more green jobs and protecting or re-purposing existing jobs where possible.An important part of the draft green growth strategy is the new energy strategy from the Department for the Economy. It notes an ambition to deliver energy savings of % from buildings and industry by  and meet at least % of electricity consumption from a erse mix of renewable sources by .While the legislation may be edging forward and strategies are emerging, the current Northern Ireland report within the latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment makes for sobering reading. The Government is required by the Climate Change Act  to conduct such an assessment every five years to inform the UK National Adaptation Plans for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The assessment covers  specic risks and opportunities in detail across themes such as infrastructure, health, the natural environment, international dimensions and business and industry.Taking the business and industry theme, issues such as increased flooding of business sites, increased levels of coastal flooding, access to finance, worker productivity and disruption to supply chains could all be at risk from climate change.For example, the annual bill for damage for non-residential properties in Northern Ireland is expected to increase by % by  due to flooding events. The expected annual damages for UK business properties from coastal flooding is expected to increase by % by .The Climate Change Risk Assessment also suggests that there is a risk that access to finance, investment, insurance, and capital for businesses are negatively impacted by climate change through decline in availability and affordability of insurance, a reduction in the value of assets and investment and increased credit risks and cost of capital.Across Northern Ireland, this is currently a medium risk, but it has the potential to rise to high magnitude in future.With these potential risks fast approaching, finding a path to net-zero is crucial. The net-zero carbon roadmap produced for Belfast is enlightening in this regard. Currently, % of Belfast’s emissions come from the domestic housing sector, with transport responsible for % of emissions, public and commercial buildings for % and industry %.Belfast’s roadmap includes an assessment of the potential contribution of approximately  energy-saving or low-carbon measures.I don’t think anyone knows where the money is coming from to pay for these initiatives, but it may be the case that a slowness to act has brought us to the point where we can’t quibble on the cost.Andrew Webb is chief economist at Grant ThorntonMost ReadFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest EnvironmentEdwin Poots backs GAA Green Club programmeRosalind SkillenOpinionWe are not beat in climate change battle but we must act nowEco-friendly alternatives: seven everyday household items you can easily replaceBehavioural change key to ‘going green’: expertCampaigning mum transforms old crisp packets into £, for stillbirth charityLatestUkrainian ambassador says we experienced ‘hassle’ when applying for UK visaSecond largest daily spike in diesel prices in more than two decadesBrexit not as calamitous for Ireland as feared, politicians toldSky Vegas fined almost £.m after sending recovering addicts ‘free spins’British girl who inspired first Disney princess with glasses invited to Baftas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Northern Ireland’s average diesel price is .p per litre or £. for a -litre fill.Petrol and diesel prices have increased by .% and .% in the last  months, respectively.Consumer Council Head of Transport Richard Williams has said that this increase is “driven by factors outside the control of consumers” and as with domestic energy costs too, this contributes to “a worrying time” for consumers.“It is likely that these price increases will encourage drivers to rethink how they make their journeys,” he said.“In the short term there are small things you can do to make the fuel you buy go further such a maintaining your vehicle properly and properly inflating the tyres. You can also use our free fuel checker tool for a weekly guide to the best price within your area. It is available on our website,” he added. In the longer term, Mr Williams has suggested that this ongoing economic crisis may force motorists to consider whether it is time stop using petrol or diesel altogether and purchase an electric vehicle instead.“This is something all car drivers are going to have to do eventually as the UK government has already announced a ban on the sale of all petrol and diesel vehicles by ,” he said.“Currently only .% of vehicles in Northern Ireland are electric but this is increasing, with a % increase on electric vehicle registrations from  to .“Many consumers will have questions around the cost of purchasing and running an electric vehicle, where and how they will charge it and even whether the battery range is sufficient for their driving needs,” he added.“The Consumer Council continues to work with government, elected representatives, consumer bodies and industry to safeguard the people of Northern Ireland and ensure they have the information and support required in order to make the move away from petrol or diesel.”While fuel consumption has a lot to do with the car you buy, whatever you drive there are things you can do to save fuel, save money and cut pollutiongoing electric is not an option right now. top tips on saving fuel. Keep your tyres inflated. Under-inflated tyres will make your car use more fuel so always check the pressure regularly.. Reduce the drag. This could be by removing roof racks or boxes which all add to your fuel consumption. Pack carefully to reduce drag.. Declutter your car. Less weight means less fuel soyou don’t need it right away, take it out.. Don’t fill your car up with fuel. Fuel is heavy so don’t overfill your tankyou’re not planning a long journey.. Brake and accelerate less — both of these burn fuel. Try to drive smoothly, accelerate gently and read the road ahead to avoid unnecessary braking. Decelerate smoothly as well by releasing the accelerator in time, leaving the car in gear.. Avoid stopping and starting where possible. Roll up slowly for traffic lights or coming to a stop at a queue where you might not have to stop completely.. Get your car serviced regularly. For best efficiency to ensure your car is running as smoothly as possible.. Use the right specication of engine oilto improve efficiency.. Don’t hang around — idling wastes fuel and your engine warms up more quickly when you’re moving so don’t start the engine until you’re ready to go.. Plan your journey — getting lost wastes fuel. Check traffic news before you go too as well as sticking to the sat nav.. Combine short trips — cold starts use more fuel so it pays to combine tripsyou can.. Walk or cycle —you’re only going a couple of miles or so, do you really need to use the car . Use your air conditioning wisely — at low speeds, it increases fuel consumption but at higher speeds the effect is less noticeable. Try opening the windows around town and save the air-con for the motorway. Running it at least once a week helps keep it in good condition.. Cut down on the electrics — turn off your rear window heater, demister fan and headlights when you don’t need them. Stick to the limit — going faster uses more fuel. Drive at mph and you’ll use up to % more than at mph and up to % more than at mph. Taking it up to mph can use up to % more fuel than at mph.Most ReadFloundering council’s £,-a-day boss quits just days into role – putting fourth person in charge in three monthsDoctor faces tribunal over ‘cover-up’ of child’s deathThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland braced for strong winds as Met Eireann issue gale warning for islandPortadown man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in London black cabTop VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayVideo: CCTV shows the moment thieves rob Moneymore store of k of stockPlayVideo: Two children hospitalised as car overturns in west BelfastLatest Northern IrelandBrexit not as calamitous for Ireland as feared, politicians toldUK Government should ‘see what more we can do’ in Ukraine, claims DUP leader DonaldsonGlentoran - Cltonville: Paddy McLaughlin insists win is ‘no bigger than beating Warrenpoint’ in title race’s latest twistDoctor hid fact that hip surgery on -year-old patient who died was unnecessaryDavid Healy explains why Linfield are keeping injury news quiet and appeals for understanding from fans as title race reaches climaxLatestUkrainian ambassador says we experienced ‘hassle’ when applying for UK visaSecond largest daily spike in diesel prices in more than two decadesBrexit not as calamitous for Ireland as feared, politicians toldSky Vegas fined almost £.m after sending recovering addicts ‘free spins’British girl who inspired first Disney princess with glasses invited to Baftas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

Aontuacute says Rosemary also opposes the de-prioritisation funding of hundreds of local schools that is contained in the Integrated Education Bill.Her party leader, Peader Toacuteibiacuten, said , people are on housing waiting lists, , on hospital waiting lists for longer than a year, a quarter of a million people are in poverty and Sinn Fein and SDLP MLAs have voted for abortion right up until the birth of the child.He declared: ldquoThat the DUP has torn down Stormont in the middle of these very real human crisis is wrong and it must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoAontuacute is the only political party calling for the reform of the democratic institutions to prevent any one party tearing them down again or any one party preventing an Executive being formed in the future.ldquoThese le and death issues are too important for Stormont to be crashed over and over again. We are also calling for the suspension of MLA salaries for the political parties who crash the democratic institutions or prevent Executives being formed.Mr Aontuacute described Ms McGlone as a le-long human rights activist and nationalist who stopped voting for the SDLP because ldquoit abandoned her and so many communities to pursue identity politics.He continued: ldquoRosemary will lead the fight to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people who currently have no representation in Co Down. Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill. All students mdash Catholic, Protestant and Integrated mdash should be treated equally.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

Portrush were able to add a fourth goal to their total just before half-time.Unfortunately it didnrsquot take long for Portrush to find the back of the net for their fth of the day after the restart. This came courtesy of a quick attack down the left-hand side before a perfectly placed shot across goal.This didnrsquot stop lsquoHinch fighting for every ball and looking to keep possession. lsquoHinch were able to win several short corners but were unable to convert their chances, due to a strong Portrush defence.When Portrush were able to break in to the lsquoHinch circle they won short corners. However, they were unable to convert these corners after trying several dferent routines.In the final quarter, Ballynahinch team-mates Alex Millar, Ashley Brown and Leslie Harrison continued to push the ball up towards the midfield and forwards but they were unable to break the Portrush defence or the ball travelling too quickly for players to stop before ending up over the baseline.Matty Martin and Adam Dodds had a great tag team run up the pitch with Matty having a shot on goal. Unfortunately it was stopped by the Portrush defence.The lsquoHinch men continued to press and win the ball with every try right up until the final whistle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 4%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash A pound, environmental improvement package for Downpatrick has been one of the schemes temporarily affected by the Government freeze on public expenditure, it has been revealed.Down councillors have been told that the commencement of the scheme has unfortunately been delayed due to the current Government moratorium.However, councillors have been assured that the scheme will commence in the new financial year, beginning next month.The environmental improvement scheme involves upgrading English Street and parts of Irish Street and Stream Street.The chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, said the forthcoming conference on the regeneration of Downpatrick will bring positive financial support to the entire regeneration concept.ldquoIt is a shot in the arm for those pessimists who have been cynical about the regeneration board and it will give a morale boost to those who resiliently and optimistically worked through the moratorium to anticipate the coming to fruition of major and minor works, said Mr Quinn.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the one area which has been socially deprived in the Down District for some time, Ballymote, will get a boost as a sign that there is a positive commitment towards making the district work inspire of all.NEWCASTLE ndash Residents living near Newcastlersquos Donard Park have launched a campaign of opposition to plans to site a go-kart track close to their homes.A petition has been drawn up and a series of letters are being written by the residents of Shan Slieve Drive in an effort to persuade the DoE to refuse planning permission for the project.The track, which is to be sited closed to the Donard Park soccer pitches, will cover an area of approximately  square metres in and around a wooded area. The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August. Residents would not be able to enjoy their gardens or leave windows openthe track was operating.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Killyleagh community has been urged to help combat at mounting problem of teenage drinking in public and vandalism.The appeal comes from the local Town Committee and follows a special meeting last Wednesday night involving the RUC, councillors and a council official.The townrsquos police sergeant and the three local councillors for the area ndash Mr Sam Osborne, Miss Margaret Ritchie and Mr William Dick ndash attended the meeting to hear complaints from the Town Committee about an upsurge in incidents involving young people.Town Committee secretary, Mrs Joyce McClurg, said many elderly people are terried because of the incidents. She said items are even thrown at passing cars in the townrsquos main streets.The discussion centred on the possibility of including Killyleagh in any further council bye-laws to prohibit drinking in public.The councillors urged the committee to contact the council to make them aware of the need for the bye-laws.BISHOPSCOURT ndash The owners of the former Bishopscourt airfield have outlined their plans to turn it into an international standard motor-cycle race track.Owners David Beattie and John Grfin believe the track can become one of the best circuits in Britain in the next two to three years.They pledged the former RAF base will be transformed over the coming weeks into a circuit as good as any in Ireland.And they have promised to bring over some of the top names in world motor-cycle racing, with the eventual target a world championship grand prix race.The duo gave a detailed outline of their proposals at a special press conference held in Strangford on Thursday night. It was ostensibly geared towards announcing the first race meeting at Bishopscourt for  years on March  ndash but as a result of the local controversy which has surrounded the project, they took the opportunity to answer many of the criticisms.Mr Beattie said: ldquoWe believe racing at Bishopscourt will put this end of the county on the map.ARDGLASS ndash A claim has been made this week that Ardglass fishermen will not benefit from a trawler decommissioning scheme announced by the Government.Local SDLP councillor Mr Dermot Curran says Ardglass trawler men will be allowed ldquovery littleany of the pound million which has been earmarked for the scheme.The pound million is intended to over the entire UK fishing fleet over a two-year period. The money will be paid to owners wishing to leave the industry, therefore reducing fishing capacity.Mr Curran said the money on offer is too little to help local fishermen.ldquoThere are  boats in Ardglass. A number of owners want to leave the industry, but this will not let them get out, he added.Mr Curran said Northern Ireland fishermen were in dficulty, with some living on the breadline.Accusing the

sure that the case of local fishermen is given a fair hearing.CROSSGAR ndash A high school headmaster has warned that teachersrsquo jobs are at risk unless the Government makes alterations to the LMS funding system.Mr Colm Hanna, principal of Crossgarrsquos St Colmcillersquos High School, said this week that unless the Government removes the responsibility of teachersrsquo salaries from school budgets then staff may be laid off.Addressing his schoolrsquos annual prize distribution on Wednesday night, Mr Hanna said it was wrong for schools to have to make the decision on how many teachers should be employed and their levels of pay.ldquoOn introduction the Government was at great pains to assure us that the purpose of LMS was to enable schools to decide their own priorities in the allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching unions and their demands for better promotion prospects and smaller classes, and it decided to off-load the problems, via LMS, on to inidual schools who now have to take the decision about class size, the number of teachers to be employed and their levels of pay, he added.SEAFORDE ndash A new phase in the drive to plant one million new trees in Northern Ireland was officially launched at a

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy.

The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

The North Antrim MP urged the Treasury to make a temporary cut to fuel duty and VAT to help motorists in NI who he said are paying £ per week just to drive to and from work.The North Antrim MP said: “Within a rural area like Northern Ireland, many who work in our schools, hospitals and manufacturing have no access to public transport and depend on their car.”He said: “Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has written to Chancellor with serious proposals which would help working families. It is time for the Government to step up and address a problem which has been predicted for weeks.”Other proposals made by the DUP include cancelling the planned .% increase in National Insurance contributions and offering targeted extra support to households in greatest need.UUP leader Doug Beattie has written to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic asking for immediate action to bring about a reduction in VAT on energy costs across the United Kingdom.He said: “If this can be done, it will give the most vulnerable hope that we can get through this present crisis which will help the material and societal wellbeing of the people of Northern Ireland.”He added: “I am extremely concerned that energy prices are soaring exponentially throughout the United Kingdom creating real societal dficulty.”Sinn Fein leader Michelle O’Neill said the Tory government must do more support workers and families struggling with cost of living.She also blamed the DUP for “walking away” from the Executive thus preventing a budget from being set while also preventing ministers from taking further action. In a letter to PM Boris Johnson, Ms O’Neill called on the British government to abandon its plans to hike people’s taxes from April and to introduce a windfall tax on high-profiting energy companies.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked.

It was carried out by Uswitch and can be viewed here: https:www.uswitch car-insurance guides uk-dog-friendly-beaches-mapped In their list of  beaches from across the UK, Ogmore Beach comes in third place behind Cayton Bay in North Yorkshire and Oxwich Beach near Swansea.MORE NEWS:Coronavirus: One in three adults in Wales now fully vaccinatedDream seaside home has seven bedrooms and an amazing al-fresco entertaining areaLaurence Llewellyn-Bowen joins campaign to transform oldest Vale homeThe Uswitch guide says that Ogmore Beach is best for fishing, walking and dog-friendly pubs and the car park costs £ a day, with dogs allowed on the beach all-year round and there are no restrictions. They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe app would let users know real-time data on public transport and the road network, and the estimated time to get somewhere by car, train, bus or bike.A huge upgrade in traffic monitoring, new bus lanes, and a state-of-the-art new traffic control room also form part of Cardf council’s plans for an ‘intelligent transport system’.Buses could also be ordered like taxis, taking a route based on the demand for the service determined by public requests.The council will consult the public on its plans to roll out the changes for the system, which it hopes will encourage people to walk, cycle or take public transport.Cllr Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: “We want to ask the public their views on our draft strategy to build an intelligent transport system in Cardf. We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is a question of safety, and it is fair to say I don’t have that trust in them. vw,vw,px, px\"Mazepin in action for Haas during the pre-season test in Barcelona “It is good to keep alloptions open.

I did not receive any hint, or any support, or be told that this is the decision we have taken. I learnt the same time as you did.“I lost my dream which I have been working towards for  years.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. .removeI thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/19973551.taron-egerton-shares-health-update-collapsing-stage-west-end-play/res","title":"taron egerton shares health update collapsing stage west end play","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The funds will be used to supply lesaving defibrillators, which are stationed throughout the local community. However, it is so much more than just a run. “There will be music, colour and catering. While Paul’s Run, which is a k run, takes centre stage, it will be followed by a shorter ‘Colour Dash’ for children.“This idea actually originated from Paul himself. As a member of the PFA, it was an idea he played with for many years as his son Elliot attends The Irish Society Primary School. “When our new committee came together and amazingly came up with the same idea we knew we had to make it work in memory of Paul. “We reached out to Paul’s widow Leanne, who has been so supportive. When she told us about her charity, it all fell into place.“Paul’s Run is very much a community event. Paul meant so much to so many, so we hope for a good turnout. “It is open to all ages and it is purposely a ‘non-chipped’ run, to make it more accessible to all fitness levels. The main run will be followed by a colour-dash to ensure that younger children are not left out of the fun.”Causeway Coast and Glens Council assisted the parents committee by granting access to the town’s Christie Park for the event.“The council have been so supportive,” added Mr Murdock. “We are a new committee and this is the first public event we have ever organised, so the council’s support and understanding has been such a welcomed aid.“The run which will take place on Saturday, May  at am, will commence and finish at The Irish Society Primary School. Runners will pass the Christie Park on route, which will be a ‘colour station’.“This is our first year holding such an event, the most important aim for us is to have family fun and celebrations and let’s see just how much we can raise for Paul’s Legacy along the way.”More details will be announced in due course, However, in the meantime, you can sign up via the link below to be the first to receive more information about this family friendly and fun event: https:mailchi.mp f pauls-run-sign-up"},{"url":null,"title":"east antrim teachers new cookbook explores the joy of home baking ","story":"Entrepreneurial sisters launch female mentorship programme in memory of father   Court hears of ‘mass brawl involving  people’ at wedding receptionNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleBread and Butter: Larne teachers new cookery book explores the joy of home bakingA Larne author has published a new cookery book full of recipes inspired by her grandmother’s home baking.By Helena McManusWednesday, th March , : amUpdated Wednesday, th March , : am  \"       \"  Ciara McLaughlin, a teacher at Mary Queen of Peace Primary School, Glenravel, released ‘Bread and Butter’ at the end of February.A collection of  simple recipes focusing on local produce and fresh ingredients, the book grew from a project she completed while studying Graphic Design and Illustration at Ulster University. \"The idea for Bread and Butter came about during my time at university as a self-directed design project to upgrade my little blue notebook of all our family recipes,\" explained Ciara, a former pupil of of St Anthonys Primary School, Larne and St Killian’s College.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\"I was drawn to the idea of exploring my family’s food heritage by ing into the stories behind all those recipes and knew instantly what the main focus of the book would be: Granny McLaughlin. Granny had died before I was born but her recipes had been passed down through the family and baked throughout my childhood. She was very much a part of my upbringing and she had achieved that by baking her way into the hearts of those who knew her.Teacher Ciara McLaughlin has released a new cookery book, Bread and Butter.\"Baking was Granny’s way of nourishing, caring and loving and that’s something that you will definitely find in my family. You’re hardly in the door until the kettle’s boiled and a scone is plated up with butter and homemade jam. I think there’s an element of traditional Irish hospitality behind it but the same is shared by cultures across the world. Food has the power to connect people – even those who are no longer around –and that’s why I knew I had to write this book.\"The ’university project’ version of Bread and Butter, a small prototype of only  recipes, won runner up in the British Design and Publication Awards .It caught the eye of Michael O’Brien from The O’Brien Press, who offered Ciara a publishing contract for the book.\"I was responsible for every element in the book: the writing, the photos, the illustrations and the design,\" Ciara added. \"Plus I also teach full-time and run my designer baking business, Swallow Barn, so it was a very hectic year!\"When it came to the photography stage, I didn’t even own a camera but over the course of a few weeks I gathered together the necessary equipment and transformed our little outside barn into a makesht photography studio. I would dedicate my weekends to baking and photographing, write recipes late into the night, and called on my design skills when it was time to put the book together. Thankfully my family supported me with their talents as Mummy is a fantastic home baker and Daddy is an expert in graphic design.\"The  or so simple recipes that made the final book are carefully arranged to reflect the feel and flavour of the four seasons. \"Through my writing I wanted to weave in some of the stories that conjure the charm of Granny’s quaint farmhouse, along with tales of my own childhood to show how the recipes are almost this living and changing thing. The recipes in Bread and Butter are there as a starting point to help you fall in love with simple, homemade food and bring the joy of baking to everyone’s table.\"Bread and Butter can be purchased from The Book Nook and The Dairy in Larne, Nook Living and The Secret Bookshelf in Carrickfergus, as well as in-store and online with Waterstones, Easons, Amazon, and WHSmith. It is also available with The Book Centres, who voted the collection as their Cookery Book of the Month for March.Since the books publication at the end of February, Ciara has appeared on Highland Radio, where she made pancakes on a live Zoom stream.She will also be in Waterstones, Ballymena on Saturday March  from .pm-.pm to sign copies of the book and offer a demonstration on icing biscuits just in time for Mother’s Day.Ciaras business, Swallow Barn can be found on Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":null,"title":"inclusive equipment for replacement play park in carrickfergus ","story":"Entrepreneurial sisters launch female mentorship programme in memory of father   Court hears of ‘mass brawl involving  people’ at wedding receptionNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleCastlemara set to benefit from replacement play parkWork has commenced on a much-anticipated replacement play park at Castlemara in Carrickfergus.By News ReporterWednesday, th March , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  Pictured are Jack Salt from Haffey’s, Claire Duddy MEABC, John McVeigh MEABC, Ald Billy Ashe MEABC, Cllr Cheryl Brownlee MEABC, Addison Gray and Cllr Lauren Gray MEABC at Castlemara Play Park.The new play area will draw on the rich heritage of the town and will include a number of inclusive pieces of play equipment to meet the needs of children with a range of abilities.Contractors will be on-site for  weeks to deliver the project, with works due to complete in late April early May.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
