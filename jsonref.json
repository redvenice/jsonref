Photograph: Tom Honan For a group of schoolgirls in a Dublin secondary school, the chilly, open-window policies in classrooms during the pandemic proved the final straw.Students at Maryfield College, an all-girls school in Drumcondra, Dublin, have launched a campaign to end what they describe as cold, impractical and discriminatory skirt-only uniform policies.While a growing number of Irish schools allow girls to wear trousers, many continue to insist skirts are mandatory.Students argue that the policies are uncomfortable, outdated and hinder exercise and cycling to school.“This was a problem before Covid,” said Riya Philip (15), a transition-year student. “But it’s really been highlighted during the winter where girls are being asked in some schools to sit in a room with windows and doors open in a uniform skirt with bare legs.”Strong ersityAnita Sibi (15) said there was a strong ersity argument for ending skirt-only policies to accommodate transgender students.“Often the only option for LGBT students in a girls’ school is to wear a tracksuit, but those students stand out hugely from the crowd,” she said. Ellen O’Mahony (15) said while Maryfield College is due to adopt trousers as part of its school uniform next September. following consultation with parents, students and staff, other students are not as fortunate.“We feel this is a right for all and shouldn’t depend on a small group of people on a school board of management,” she said.The students have launched a #whowearsthetrousers campaign on social media and are urging other schools to join in. An opinion poll they conducted locally indicates there is overwhelming support for change.  The Irish Second-Level Students’ Union says it is a growing issue in schools and is due to be addressed at its first women’s conference on Tuesday. “Gender-specific uniforms are the one issue we see come up time and time again when consulting with students,” said ISSU president Emer Neville. “... There is no argument in favour of gendered uniforms that is good enough to justify it. It’s time this outdated practice is brought to a much-needed end.”Equality issueA number of TDs contacted as part of the school-uniform campaign have asked parliamentary questions on the topic and say they will adopt it as an equality issue. In response, Minister for Education Norma Foley has said inidual school authorities are responsible for drawing up school policy in relation to the wearing of uniforms. “Schools are advised to consult with parents and students when drafting a policy on uniforms,” she said.Draft legislation – the Student and Parent Charter Bill – is currently progressing through the Dáil which recognises the importance of listening to the voice of children and students, she added.The girls at Maryfield conceived the campaign during a Young Social Innovators module, which encourages students to come up with solutions to real-world problems.Their teacher Margaret McLoughlin said the girls agreed that the notion of uniforms making girls appear “ladylike” was outdated. ‘Cannot cycle’“The girls wear leggings and jeans at home, and rarely wear a skirt. As they say themselves, they cannot cycle to schools in the skirts.”As far as student Anita Sibi is concerned, it’s an issue fundamental to students’ wellbeing.“I think it’s an issue which can affect students’ mental health. At the end of the day, school should be a safe environment where students can feel comfortable and be themselves.”"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"\u0026ldquoWindthrow is now the greatest threat to economic forestry in IrelandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"refugee process at european borders needs to easier and quicker says dooley","story":"Mr Dooley said from the EU side there needed to be a more coordinated effort to get people over the border faster.

Photograph: Andrea VerdelliGettyChina’s foreign minister has said Russia is his country’s “most important strategic partner” as he refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine. Wang Yi said ties with Moscow constituted “one of the most crucial bilateral relationships in the world”.“No matter how perilous the international landscape, we will maintain our strategic focus and promote the development of comprehensive China-Russia partnership in the new era,” Mr Wang told reporters at a news conference on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China’s ceremonial parliament.“The friendship between the two peoples is iron clad,” he added.China has broken with the US, Europe and others that have imposed sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.Beijing says that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations should be respected but that sanctions create new issues and disrupt the process of a political settlement.China’s Red Cross has said however it will provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine “as soon as possible”.“China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in pushing for peace and promoting talks, and is willing to work with the international community to carry out necessary mediation when needed.” China proposes that “humanitarian action” must abide by the principles of neutrality and impartiality, and humanitarian issues should not be politicised, Mr Yi added.Much attention has been paid to a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin in Beijing on February 4th, after which the sides issued a joint statement affirming “their strong mutual support for the protection of their core interests”.Russia endorsed China’s view of Taiwan as an “inalienable part of China, and opposes any forms of independence of Taiwan”, while China backed Russia in opposing the further enlargement of Nato. Since then, Mr Xi’s government has refused to criticise the attack but tried to distance itself from Mr Putin’s war by calling for dialogue and calling for respect for sovereignty.That prompted suggestions Mr Putin failed to tell the Chinese leader his plans before their statement.Beijing has denounced trade and financial sanctions on Moscow and says Washington is to blame for the conflict. – APReutersFull coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"vigilant lviv on high alert with russian losses scored on cafe windows","story":"The congregation gathers for a Sunday service at the Saint Peter and Paul Garrison Church in Lviv on Sunday.

The title refers to the traditional small buildings in the gardens of Ukrainian homes where families gather to cook, preserve and eat their garden produce during the hot summer months.Evocative photographs of these eccentrically lovely structures accompanied hearty recipes such as lazy dumplings with green beans, poppy seeds and crispy shallots, and slow-roast pork with sauerkraut and dried fruit. “The book,” wrote the Daily ’s reviewer, “is a lesson in what it is to be Ukrainian”.The idea that food is not just the stuff that keeps us going, but the stuff of our very identity is to be found endlessly explored in the recipe books of cooks who are also talented writers.In her memoir with recipes, Orchards in the Oasis, Josceline Dimbleby recalled her seven-year-old self’s Damascene revelation, when the cook at her family home (her father was Minister at the British Legation in Damascus) offered her a delicate pastry: “That was the moment…which kindled my lifelong passion for food and flavour”.Cairo-born Claudia Roden was a 20-year-old student in London during the Suez crisis of 1956. Collecting the recipes eventually published as A Book of Middle Eastern Food became an antidote to feelings of exile: “For me,” she said, “history was personal.”For all of us, whether or not we have suffered the misery of conflict, the food we grew up eating becomes an inseparable part of who we are. (This is often, but not always, a pleasure: along with fond recollections of my mother’s epic Sunday roasts, the sickly Kentish speciality, Gypsy Tart - a school dinner staple - remains an emetic memory.)The actor Stanley Tucci, who lost his ability to eat during cancer treatment, wrote in his memoir, Taste, of the intimate connection between food, creativity and love: “Food was not just a huge part of my life: it basically was my life.”It is this sentiment that has united Olia Hercules with her old friend, the UK-based Russian chef, Alissa Timoshkina, to launch the charity, Cook for Ukraine, with donations going to Unicef.Amid the horror of war, they say, “Food is a symbol of people coming together”. Those of us who watch the news in shock and dread now have the opportunity to make a modest gesture of support, nourishing body and soul while learning something of what it means to be Ukrainian.Shirley Hughes leaves a remarkable legacyAnyone who learned to love books in early childhood has a mental library of stories and pictures so ingrained that they seem not acquired but innate, like language itself.My own list includes Babar, Orlando the Marmalade Cat, and Shirley Hughes’s illustrations for Dorothy Edwards’s enchanting My Naughty Little Sister series. Thirty years after I first read them, they had a new lease of life as bedtime stories for my small son.Hughes’s death at the age of 94 is a painful loss for her family but what an enduring monument she created in her humane, funny and finely observed accounts of the jeopardy and consolations of childhood.Interviewed in 1978, she said, “I think that a good picture book is a complete world.” So it was for the first readers of Dogger, Alfie, and her many other books.

The Government has said an increased number can come to help with this summer’s harvest of everything from potatoes, carrots, cabbages, cauliflowers and lettuces to apples and pears.Wage rise is \u0027unaffordable\u0027Ms Capper said: “I am not sure why we need a high pay rate when the country is experiencing a cost of living crisis. It is unaffordable, unworkable and undeliverable.”Most foreign seasonal fruit and veg pickers are generally paid by the hour and stay in the UK for up to six months, which would mean a half-yearly salary of £12,800. The Home Office has calculated the rate based on at least a 48-hour week, which works out at £10.26 an hour.However, the NFU said foreign seasonal workers generally worked 40 hours a week, which means farmers will have to pay out at a rate of £12.31 an hour - a 38 per cent increase on the current national living wage of £8.91 per hour.The Government is adamant that British farmers must be weaned off cheap foreign labour, with all industries being urged to invest more in boosting the skills of UK workers as part of its post-Brexit immigration policy.A government spokesman said: “While acknowledging the sector’s reliance on foreign workers, the UK is committed to becoming a high-skilled, high-wage economy.“The Government has been clear that more must be done to attract UK workers through offering training, career options, wage increases and to invest in increased automation technology.”Knock-on effects of Ukraine invasionIt comes as farms face potential disruption to their normal source of seasonal workers as two thirds - around 20,000 - are from Ukraine, where the Russian invasion may impede the flow of staff.Farming has traditionally relied heavily on experienced eastern European workers from countries including Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Poland, although it attempted during the pandemic to recruit local workers because of travel restrictions.The NFU accused the Government of issuing confused messages, as it said it had previously been promised that minimum wages for the scheme could be set at £10.10 an hour as an acceptable level to match skilled worker rates.It said that even that represented a 13 per cent increase on the current national living wage of £8.91 and seven per cent above the new April 2022 rate of £9.50. It is urging the Government to rethink the 38 per cent rise based on the skilled worker salary of £25,600.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin \u0026#39manipulating\u0026#39 Emmanuel Macron and West over ceasefire, says KyivPolitics latest news: Number of Ukrainian refugees in Britain will increase \u0026#39very, very quickly\u0026#39, says ministerScientists decode pig grunts to allow farmers to work out when they are fighting or hungryFive reasons to suggest \u0026#39puffy-faced\u0026#39 Putin could be seriously illLatest pictures from Ukraine: Families face desperate dash to safety as humanitarian corridors reopen Police officer \u0026#39beaten\u0026#39 by gang of thugs who steal his radio in BradfordMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stop making unconditional offers students strings attached universities","story":"Universities have been told to stop making “conditional unconditional” offers and prevent students making choices that are not “in their best interests”.Universities UK, the body which represents Britain’s higher education institutions, published its code of practice on fair admissions on Monday following an 18-month review. The code sets out how processes must “support student choice” and avoid creating “unnecessary pressure” on applicants.It advises universities against making conditional unconditional offers to students, or offers with significantly lower grade requirements based on applicants making their institution a firm choice.Conditional unconditional offers give students a place regardless of their A-level grades, on the condition that they make the university their firm first choice.The practice has been widely criticised over concerns that it demotivates students from working hard for their A-level grades and fulfilling their potential.It was banned by the Office for Students, the higher education regulator in England, from Jul 2020 to Sep 2021, following reports that students were inundated with unconditional offers in the wake of A-levels being cancelled during the pandemic.Curbs on student incentivesData published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) in 2020 showed that in 2019, there were 35 universities and colleges where at least one per cent of offers made were conditional unconditional. A Ucas survey of more than 30,000 students in 2019 found that more than half of applicants had received an offer with an incentive to select a university as their first choice.Incentives may include offers of guaranteed accommodation or cash payments, bursaries or scholarships.Universities UK said institutions that signed up to the new code of practice should not make conditional unconditional offers and should use unconditional offers only in limited circumstances, for example, where admissions are informed by interviews or auditions.The code adds that universities must also make sure incentives do not place “undue pressure on the decisions that applicants make, or the timescales in which they should make them”.Universities will be expected to sign the code, but it will not be compulsory. A cross-sector group will evaluate how effective the code is following its publication.‘Putting applicants’ needs first’Prof Quintin McKellar, the vice-president for England and Northern Ireland at Universities UK, said: “The Fair Admissions Code of Practice allows universities and colleges to make a public commitment to prioritise applicants’ interests above all else.“All applicants must be able to make informed decisions based on clear evidence of their strengths, capability and potential, and on comprehensive and consistent information about how courses will meet their expectations, as future students and in their lives beyond graduation.”Michelle Donelan, the higher education minister, said: “These changes really help to put university applicants’ needs first. Prospective students should expect clarity from the provider and the course about quality, transparency and fair access.“I have long called for these much-needed changes to the admissions process, such as increased transparency in advertising, and also called out the use of conditional unconditional offers which only really benefit the university or college.“This code highlights the undue pressure this places on applicants to make a decision which may not be in their best interests.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that it welcomed the “absolute clarity with which it reinforces the message that the use of so-called ‘conditional unconditional offers’ is unacceptable”.“Indeed, the vast majority of unconditional offers are unnecessary and do not serve students’ best interests, as this code recognises,” he added.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin \u0026#39manipulating\u0026#39 Emmanuel Macron and West over ceasefire, says KyivPolitics latest news: Number of Ukrainian refugees in Britain will increase \u0026#39very, very quickly\u0026#39, says ministerScientists decode pig grunts to allow farmers to work out when they are fighting or hungryFive reasons to suggest \u0026#39puffy-faced\u0026#39 Putin could be seriously illLatest pictures from Ukraine: Families face desperate dash to safety as humanitarian corridors reopen Police officer \u0026#39beaten\u0026#39 by gang of thugs who steal his radio in BradfordMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"11 ways tory cost living","story":" ways Tory cost-of-living crisis will squeeze your family next monthEnergy bills are rising along with National Insurance, Council Tax, rail fares and inflation - while other help is frozen, wages suffer a real-terms cut and you have to pay for Covid tests.

Wages for teachers and NHS staff, benefits and pensions are all set to rise by less than inflation, leaving you with less disposable income. And those paying student loans are hit with a aposstealthapos rise. Tory ministers announced a £ council tax discount this April for people in Band A-D homes in England. But it won’t touch the sides of the energy bills price rise, let alone all other squeezes as the country starts paying for Covid.  Another £ “rebate” is really just a loan that has to be paid back out of future bills and won’t arrive until October. The minimum wage for over-s is rising from £. to £. an hour, but could also be cancelled out by the squeeze. Boris Johnson is currently avoiding much political pain over the price rises due to the focus on the war in Ukraine.But that won’t stop them hitting your wallet or your family… . Energy bills Regulator Ofgem confirmed the energy price cap will increase to a record £, for a typical household following soaring gas prices. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April . Those on fixed tarfs will be hit by rises when their fixed-rate period ends. Rishi Sunak has announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ rebate off energy bills in October.But Labour has branded him the loan shark Chancellor as the rebate is effectively a loan which will need to be repaid over five years. The discount will be clawed back from people’s bills in equal £ instalments from . Pressure will build on the Government to act again in October, when a second hike is expected. The Chancellor admitted annual bills could rise more than £, this year.  . National Insurance riseFrom April, a £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.It will mean that employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay .p more in the pound for National Insurance from April  - from % to .%. A worker on £, a year pays an extra £ in tax. Someone on £, will pay £ more. People earning under £, a year, or £ a month, will not have to pay National Insurance or the new levy. Those supportive of Boris Johnson argue the levy is progressive as the wealthier pay more. But Tory backbenchers hostile to new taxes baulk at the plans as the tax burden hits its highest in decades. . Inflation and interest rates UK inflation has hit .% and Britons are beginning to feel the squeeze as the cost of food, energy and transport rises at the fastest for three decades. This means the same pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel.And both are products that could rise in price further due to the war between oil giant Russia and wheat-producing Ukraine. Meanwhile the Bank of England hiked interest rates earlier this month to .% in the first back-to-back increase since . This will mean mortgage rates become more expensive, an overnight rise to the monthly payments for people on standard iable rates.Mr Sunak insists inflation is a global problem post-Covid, but whether this line will hold remains to be seen.  . Council tax rise Most of England’s families will be hit with an eye-watering Council Tax rise of % or more in April, Mirror research reveals. The vast majority of cash-strapped town, city and county halls are imposing the maximum possible hike on April . Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% - the maximum normally allowed this year. And a further  planned rises higher than .%, by using allowances that were unused in previous years. Six of those authorities - Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Sandwell, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Rutland - are set to impose a .% hike. In Rutland that will raise a Band D bill by £, wiping out much of a £ discount that is meant to help pay rising energy bills. Search for your council tax rise by postcode below.  . Covid tests From April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a Covid lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This has prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments - which will get no new moneythey want to continue free tests. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but No is seeking a regulated market where each test costs a low single-figure number of pounds. This suggests a box of seven could cost £-.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.. Student loans aposstealth taxapos Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped. That means graduates will have to shell out more of their disposable income as wages and prices rise with inflation. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. IFS senior economist Ben Waltmann said it was “a further hit to real incomes”, adding it “effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings.” It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.  . Income tax goes up Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll still pay % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £,, evenaverage wages rise. According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . It will also lead to around . million more workers having their earnings going over the % tax threshold and almost . million more people will be brought into paying the basic level of income tax. The Treasury can expect to net £bn from the move. But, when the impact arrives for Brits, calls from backbenchers for the Government to change course could grow. . Real terms cut to welfare and pensionsBenefits like Universal Credit and pension rates will both rise by .%, £. a month and £. a week respectively.Tory MPs pushed through the plans last month - saying it was in line with inflation. But it’s only in line with what inflation was last Autumn, before prices began to soar at an alarming rate. Meanwhile the pensions triple lock - which would have raised the state pension by more than % - was suspended. Many are warning that this will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most. Foodbank use is expected to climb as a result and the Government is no doubt braced for more interventions from high-profile campaigners such as Man U footballer Marcus Rashford.  . A real-terms cut to childcare help Poor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation. Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April. Campaigner and working mum to a four-year-old and Gemma Widdowfield, , told MPs: “We’re all in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. We’re all feeling the pinch. “My childcare’s going up slightly but the Universal Credit cap isn’t going up at all… that’s going to be passed on to us.” . Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachers Inflation also means that many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But there are already clear signs the Treasury resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. . Rail fares Okay, we’re cheating here - this one has already come into effect. Rail passengers faced a ticket price nightmare as the steepest increases in almost a decade hit on March . According to industry body the Rail Delivery Group, people in England and Wales are set to shoulder the largest hike in rail ticket prices since January  with fares predicted to go up by .%. Labour has called the price hike brutal and campaign group Railfuture has accused Boris Johnsonaposs Government of “stoking the fire of the cost of living crisis” by enabling the increase.Ministers regulate rises in around half of fares including season tickets on most commuter routes.

The result reflects the world’s horror at the illegal actions of Vladimir Putin which has led to the slaughter of countless innocent lives.The words of condemnation must now be matched by a further tightening of the screw on Russian business and finance. The UK Government has acted swtly in cutting off banks and banning Russian planes from our airspace but has lagged behind the US and the EU in imposing other sanctions. Unlike Brussels we have still to freeze the assets of the members of the Russian Parliament. Dozens of Putin’s cronies and high-ranking military have yet to be targeted. The Tories have allowed London to become the world’s laundromat for Russian dirty money. They have also taken millions in donations from people with ties to the Kremlin. If they are serious about putting pressure on the Russian regime they should widen sanctions andthe donations. The longer they take to act, the more the suspicion grows that they are still in thrall to the oligarchs.  The best of us While Vladimir Putin has shown the worst of humanity with his brutal invasion, the public response to his vile actions has shown the best of humanity. Millions of people have donated to charities to help the people of Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands made homeless by the war. Some volunteers have even driven to the Polish-Ukrainian border to deliver much-needed medical supplies, food, clothes and toys for children. Their compassion has never been more necessary.

The Home Office confirmed on Sunday that only around % of the , applicants with family links in the UK had seen their applications approved.Foreign Minister James Cleverly insisted the process had only just started after the UK faced criticism for the speed of the response to the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War.More than . million refugees from Ukraine have crossed into ­neighbouring countries, such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Moldova since the conflict began.It comes as reports emerged of people being turned back at Calais after travelling hundreds of miles to flee the conflict. Mr Cleverly was confronted with a clip of a Brit and his family who had been turned back at the French border town in a disastrous interview on Sky News.  Asked why the UK wasnapost making it easier for refugees, he said: Well we are, we have made absolutely clear that we will be supporting refugees.At the moment the vast, vast majority of refugees are in countries neighbouring Ukraine and we are providing humanitarian support to those refugees via those host nation countries because that is where the problem is at the moment.Most of these people want to get back to their own homes as quickly as possible. We have made it clear that of course we will be generous and open hearted as would expect to Ukrainians seeking to come here to the UK. Presenter Kay Burley confronted him with a clip of the family who said they had been turned back at Calais, adding: So we are not making it easier at all, are we  Mr Cleverly said he didnapost know the details of the case, but insisted that the UK was welcoming Ukrainians to its shores and supporting refugees abroad. Ms Burley intervened, demanding to know why only  visas had been granted. The top Tory said the situation has only occurred in the last couple of days and said the system had been set up quickly.  But the presenter interrupted to say people are fleeing for their lives. Mr Cleverly retorted: If you are going to ask questions, you have got to let me answer. The pair clashed again on the issue, with Ms Burley saying: Iaposve asked you several times and we have gone around the houses on the issue. Mr Cleverly went on to defend the UKaposs sanctions regime, which he said was having a real impact on Russian oligarchs and the Russian economy. He then announced he was leaving to do another interview, saying: I am afraid I have to go now. Ms Burley replied, Iaposm sure, thank you, before adding: Make of that what you will. Tory Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tughendhat led criticism over the Home Officeaposs rate of awarding visas. Itaposs certainly not a success is it  he told LBC. What we need to do is to make sure that we get the Home Office absolutely delivering, to make sure that we get the support for those who are most in need. The British people are extremely generous, you and I both know that. This isnapost some sort of, you know, illegal scam. This is, perfectly obviously, people fleeing for their lives and we need to be absolutely there to support them. In another interview, Mr Cleverly branded Moscowaposs announcement of limited ceasefires and the creation of humanitarian escape routes out of Ukraine cynical beyond words.He said the routes set up were nonsense because they would take fleeing Ukrainians into the arms of the country that is currently destroying yours, such as Belarus and Russia. It comes as Boris Johnson was due to host talks with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Dutch premier Mark Rutte in the UK today.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyPoliticsRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was in the week leading up to Christmas, that Mark became alarmed when he started experiencing severe fatigue and random pain in his back and along the side of his body.He went to his GP and was sent for scans before being told the lump was kidney cancer and that he had just months to live, Manchester Evening News reports. I knew there was something wrong, said Mark, who lives with his we Sarah and daughters, Sadie, three, and Poppy, eight. I thought it was a hernia at first. Iaposd been training for a marathon so Iaposd run a half marathon a few weeks before. Naturally, youaposre just thinking for the best. Cancer is the last thing on the list.The Manchester United season ticket holder visited his GP, and was referred to hospital for a series of scans.Last month, doctors delivered the devastating news that he had cancer. They confirmed it right out of the blue, said Mark.  They said it had spread to my spine so they needed to do radiotherapy to shrink the nodes so I can move and walk. I was straight in hospital and had radiotherapy on the Saturday. I lost use of my legs because they put me into spinal shock. I had ten sessions of that for three weeks, not really understanding how bad it was. I didnapost say anything to anyone at first because I wanted to understand what the prognosis was. Doctors then told Mark the cancer was already so advanced it was incurable. That was a bit of a shock, he said. It all happened so quickly. As soon as I knew, I told my family and friends that unfortunately theyaposre going to lose me. Thereaposs no way Iaposm going anywhere in two months. Iaposm going to keep fighting and stretch it out for as long as I can. If I can get to Christmas, amazing.Last week, Mark took to Twitter to inform his followers of his shock diagnosis. The tweet, he says, went aposmentalapos and has led to him receiving hundreds of messages of support.He hopes his story will encourage other men to check themselves for signs of cancer. Weeks on from his devastating diagnosis, Mark is still unable to walk and spends his day bed-bound at home - a far cry from his old lestyle. I was an active runner, always moving, he explained. From being really active and sociable to being sat in here every day is not the best. Iaposm positive and fighting, but it does get a bit demoralising. Iaposm getting physio every day and have managed to get into a wheelchair, which is good. Ultimately, itaposs kidney cancer and itaposs just spread everywhere. Itaposs incurable. Thereaposs nowt we can do, itaposs all about how long we can keep me alive now. Mark, who worked in IT, says he is keen to explore treatment options so he can spend longer with his loved ones. On Thursday, he tied the knot with his partner Sarah. They were joined by family for the short ceremony at their home, while the coupleaposs daughters acted as ring bearers for the big occasion. We talked about it in the past, said Mark. You donapost think we need to do this now. But when it happened, we thought crikey, we need to do it. It all worked out really well. Someone came in from the registry officer. Itaposs a huge milestone in unfortunate circumstances, but Iaposm really happy we did it.

Some girls picked it up before me and read it – and do you know what they did  They laughed. I didn’t think I was going to live past , yet now I’m a -year-old woman oiling my beard. Sometimes I wonder, “How did I get here ” I was born in London and grew up there with my mum, dad and younger brother. Outside of school, my upbringing was great. My parents took me to funfairs and theme parks, which I loved. We had picnics in the park, fun family nights and birthday parties, and we spent time with our cousins, having sleepovers. But when I wasn’t at home, it was hell on earth. The bullying started when I was in nursery school because I was a quiet, brown Sikh girl with long plaits, who was an easy target. And the more my body changed, the worse it got. When puberty hit, I gained a lot of weight. Then, when I was , I started growing hair around my throat.  My mum took me to the doctor for tests and at  I was diagnosed with polycystic oy syndrome, or PCOS, a condition that affects women’s hormone levels. Symptoms include irregular periods, growing facial hair and dficulty getting pregnant. Without hesitation, my mum took me to a salon to have my face waxed. Those appointments continued twice a week for almost four years. I spent so many hours clenching my teeth in pain while the beautician tried to be sympathetic. My mum thought, as did I, that removing the hair was the best thing we could do because it would stop people bullying me. But it didn’t. I remember walking into school after having a wax and one guy making a joke about it looking like someone had taken a razor to my face. I was going through all of this pain – because my skin was so soft and sensitive, particularly at that age – and trying so hard to conform, but all for nothing. The hair was also growing back thicker and darker after every wax. So one day, shortly after my GCSEs, I made a decision. It took a lot of strength but I thought, “I can either keep trying to fit in or I can be me.” Self-harming at school I missed a waxing appointment and when my mum asked me why I simply said, “I think I’m just going to keep it.” She was worried but she knew it was my decision. I spent the whole six-week summer holiday preparing myself and by the time I went back to start sixth form, I had a full beard. But nothing could have prepared me for the hell that awaited me. Things got massively worse and I began to self-harm. A few years ago I met a guy I used to go to school with and he said he remembers seeing marks on my hands. Clearly, no one knew what to say. The teachers occasionally suspended a bully but when they ed they were even worse because I’d got them into trouble, not just with the school but their parents. When I was  I tried to end my le because I felt I couldn’t go on. Because I was going through hell at school, I was really dficult and snappy at home. My attitude used to stink and the hormone imbalance caused by PCOS gave me mad mood swings.  I was taunted continuously and suffered awful dreams about being brutally attacked by my school bullies. When I finally left school, I struggled to find work. I did some agency roles, worked for the postal service and did some nannying but none of it felt right. Then, at , I got engaged. I’d never even met him but someone from the local Sikh temple arranged for me to meet a man in India. Because I really wanted a relationship, and at that time wanted to have children young, I went for it. That might sound mad to some people but in our culture it’s not unusual. The day I met him it was very formal and nine days later we were engaged. He didn’t comment on my facial hair but suddenly there were all these cans and can’ts. I wasn’t allowed to wear make-up or have tattoos and piercings. Then, he told mehe found out I wasn’t a virgin, he would never touch me. I broke up with him two months before we were supposed to get married and I’ve never looked back. Since then, I’ve slowly stepped away from religion and become more spiritual. And as I began to fully accept myself for who I am, I started posting bits and bobs on social media. In , a journalist got in touch with me to do an interview and when it was published, my Instagram blew up. In , I was asked to appear on the catwalk during London Fashion Week for jeweller Marianna Harutunian. Since then, I’ve been in Vogue Japan , Teen Vogue and Cosmo India . I’ve given a TED Talk, I have , Instagram followers and I’ve started my own make-up range.I’m also casually dating. I’m pansexual, which means “hearts not parts” – it doesn’t matter what your sexuality is or what your gender is, I love you for who you are. But I need someone open-minded who wants to stick around and I’m having trouble finding that. I actually had my palm read the other day and the lady told me I’m not going to meet the love of my le in the UK, because a lot of people are still really narrow-minded here. So perhaps they’re abroad! Some people treat me like a fantasy or a fetish, like they want to “try” me. They’ve got kinks that they want to delve into and that’s all I am to them. It can be dficult navigating who’s genuinely interested in me.  I hold my head up high When I think about what it means to be a woman on International Women’s Day, the first word that comes to mind is powerful. Once we understand who we really are and harness that energy, we can literally change the world. But it’s also important to acknowledge that I’m very privileged. I live in the West and even though I’m half-Indian and half-Tanzanian, I still have very fair skin. I think on International Women’s Day we should be thinking about those who aren’t as privileged – who live in countries where they can’t be openly lesbian because they’re at risk of being attacked and sometimes killed, or who are suffering because of female genital mutilation. I think more about them and the dficulties they’re going through. Looking back, despite everything, choosing not to wax my beard is probably one of the greatest decisions I’ve made, because I’m no longer hiding my true self. People still stare at me and make comments –but I hold my head up high. I surround myself with people who are non-judgmental and % on the same wave as me. As hard as the journey has been, I’m grateful.If you are feeling suicidal or affected by issues talked about by Kirk then contact Papyrus, www.papyrus-uk.org or call     or contact Samaritans, www.samaritans.org,  .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON London Fashion WeekEducationPregnancyBullyingBeardsSexualityPeriods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I wasnapost surprised.  Just the other day I saw three buses stopped at the bottom of the estate because they all had glass smashed everywhere. It had gone over a nearby mum and her pram. If you see a big group of people anywhere around here you turn around and go the other way. The girlaposs nan, who did not want to be named, told how her grandson has been attacked twice. She added: Stones are always thrown at buses around here as thereaposs nothing for the kids to do.Itaposs really bad where big groups gather around the Co-op. We donapost really go out at night and would use a taxiwe did. Itaposs not nice for the drivers or the passengers.  First said that its decision to avoid Swarclfe was to preserve the safety of both drivers and passengers. It comes after some bus passengers tweeted that the decision would inconvenience them. Normal services resumed on Sunday when the estate appeared to be quiet. Resident Keith Pettman, who was walking his dog on the estate, said he did not use buses but was still aware of issues with antisocial behaviour. There are some youths on the estate that are a little rowdy, he said. They mess about with bikes and things like all bored teenagers do but I know they get in the way of buses and people. Thereaposs definitely vandals around that will smash a few things up every so often.The field also gets ripped up and recently a load of dustbins got set on fire. Iaposve been here for a year now though and I feel safe, it doesnapost bother me too much. Another man, who wished to remain anonymous, said his daughter lives on the estate and had told him about the bus problems. He said: Itaposs quite intimidatingyou head down by the Co-op. Thereaposs a lot of vandalism on the estate and itaposs definitely getting worse. Councillor Jessica Lennox of Cross Gates and Whinmoor ward, said on Facebook: We are aware that the  and  will be erting around Swarclfe tonight as a result of some serious vandalism that took place earlier.I am glad no one was hurt. We will be seeking to hear from First what their plans are moving forward. Thehas contacted First Bus and Leeds City Council for comment.

The business has a . star rating on the site but out of  reviews, more than  were rated as terrible However, there were some aposexcellentapos reviews - with one recent visitor describing it as a splendid hotel.Some reviewers have described it as absolutely disgusting, a vile place and definitely not what you expect for £ a night. In a review as recent as this month, Richard S said: Absolutely disgusting. Not sure whether the staff have fallen out with their cleaning equipmentindeed they have any. Disgusting carpets and had to change rooms because of a large brown wet stain on the duvet cover that had followed through to the mattress cover. Got a new room, went in and there was another two large stains on my bed. He added: Gave up after that and just slept without any bed covers. Donapost think these lot have a care in the world for the hygiene of this crack den, theyaposve probably just given up. Moira H in October said: Arrived at this so called hotel and found pretty much the most dirty, disgusting and in general vile place. The lt doesnapost work, as someone with disability issue this was not good.  The staircase to the room smelt of stale fat and damp. The room was disgusting, one bath towel and one hand towel for two adults! She added: Curtains that we couldnapost close as they were hanging off the rail, a fridge barely balancing on a unit beside the single bed, god forbid you had a child with you as they would have ended up under it, a bathroom window which didnapost close, paint all over the floor of the bathroom. The shower......well..... the trickle was not any use to wash in , to have a cup of tea the kettle had to be plugged in under the desk and left on the floor, pillows were disgusting, didnapost take clothes off to sleep as there was no way I was getting into the bed! Unfortunately, this was a very quickly booked trip, I didnapost have time to look into things the way I normally would, but this so called hotel is the stuff of nightmares.And Courtney M in August said: Absolutely disgusting hotel very nice when walking in but as soon as you go to your room itaposs awful. The drains was blocked and the shower was way to hot or way too cold no in-between, the towels had foundation marks all over. Definitely not what u expect for £ a night for what I paid! The Norfolk Hotel declined to comment when approached about the negative reviews by BirminghamLive.  However, there are many aposexcellentapos and aposvery goodapos reviews for the Norfolk Hotel on Tripadvisor. Neb who posted his review last month, but visited last May, said: Where do I start  The hotel is modern and up to scratch, very polite staff and a very comfortable room! Another positive review said: After reading the reviews Iaposd been tempted to cancel my booking. Iaposm glad I didnapost. I had a lovely clean room, , the most spacious single room Iaposve stayed in. Itaposs warm, comfortable and very quiet. The shower was really hot and the bathroom spotless! The staff were friendly and I would stay here again. Iaposd also be happy to stay here with my daughter.There were a few things that didnapost overly concern me, but may be seen as criticisms by others, breakfast not included, WiFi not included, the Tvaposs aerial is a bit dodgy, and the shower curtain could do with replacing . These aposissues apos didnapost bother me so thataposs the reason Iaposve still given  stars. This hotel, based on this room, does not deserve itaposs terrible status! While another added: We stayed one night whilst watching the cricket. It was £ per person. It was clean, a bit knackered and £ - a bit like a single room in an officer’s mess. Perhaps not the place for a wedding anniversary blow out but perfect for a late night, early start. Our rooms were on the th floor - take an eye mask as the curtains aren’t great. Five stars for value for money. It was £.

However, Ms Phillips, , from Thames Ditton, Surrey, had not booked any undertakers as her -year-old father Brianaposs death was classied as aposunexpectedapos by paramedics. This meant he had to be collected by a dferent funeral director, which was acting on behalf of the coroner. Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, which was contracted by the coroner to transport the body, said the care home should have told Ms Phillips where her dadaposs body was being taken. However, she was forced to track down Brianaposs body alone after Albany Park Nursing Home, in Enfield, London, gave her the name of the undertakers and nothing . Ms Phillips said: “The care home assumed he had been handed to my undertakers. “I said ‘no he hasn’t, my undertaker is not allowed to take him until the coroner has seen the body’. I asked themthey’d handed his body to any old undertaker.Have you had a similar experience  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story “They gave me the name of the funeral directors and I had to look up their number – I remember Googling it.“For three days I was searching for my dad, I was so shocked about what was going on grief didn’t really come into it. “I was thinking ‘where is he ’ My brother joked saying maybe it wasn’t him, maybe he had gone into another room in the care home because he couldn’t get the football on the telly.” The siblings even joked that the wrong body might turn up at the funeral like in the opening scene of the  film Death at a Funeral. Ms Phillips said: “The care home had no idea where he was. I was flabbergasted and angry. The only thing they knew was the name of the undertakers who collected dad. “I would expect a care home to know what mortuary he had been taken to and who the undertakers were. I got the impression they didn’t after they said my undertakers had collected him. “I don’t think they passed over any of my contact details. The coroner said they had no contact details for me.”  After the care home gave her the name of the coroneraposs undertakers, Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, she rang them and found out her dad’s body had been taken to Haringey Mortuary. Her fruit and veg trader father died of suspected Covid on January  last year but it was not until January  that she was able to get through to the mortuary and confirm his body was there. She added: “I had to ring up the mortuary because I needed to know - because of what had gone on before – that he was there. I wanted to make sure, you stop trusting what you hear. “My dad died on the Saturday and I got through to the mortuary on the Monday. “They confirmed they had his body and said I needed to contact the coroner’s office to make an appointment .“I sent them an email and a woman rang me on Tuesday saying she was so glad I contacted her because they had no contact details for me.” Discussing Brianaposs death, Ms Phillips revealed that paramedics attempted to resuscitate him even though he previously had a ‘do not resuscitate’ order in hospital. The order was not transferred to Albany Park when he was discharged from hospital just over two weeks before his death. After the resuscitation efforts failed, the ambulance crew called the police as Brianaposs death was unexpected and therefore needed to be investigated. The police deemed it was not suspicious and rang the coroner service, who in turn organised for Floyd and Son Funeral Directors to collect Brian’s body, Ms Phillips said. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter She is only speaking out now because she does not want another person to go through the same ordeal as her. “Part of me feels guilty about complaining. I know it was a terrible December and January with the second wave, I know how hard everyone was working and how stressed people were,” she said. “ButI don’t say something it’s going to happen again.” Ms Phillips emphasised that she has no issue with Floyd and Son Funeral Directors as they were helpful in her time of need. Dean Floyd, of Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, said: When we arrive at the care home, we introduce ourselves as Floyd and Son, we advise the manager that we are here to collectand they take our details down.We advise them we are taking the deceased to wherever has been requested by the coroner. In this instance Haringey Public Mortuary. The care home should have a duty of care to relay that information to the next of kin. Floyd and Son would not have knowledge of this information. The care home should have given the mortuary number - we never bring a deceased back to Floyd’s. What’s appalling is the number is not manned over the weekend, where our number is, so any of my staff would have been able to advise where Mr Phillips was, but they would not have been able to speak to the Coroner’s office or Mortuary until Monday morning. At the very least the care home should have said Floyd and Son collected the late Brian Phillips, and given them our telephone number and we could have advised the next of kin. Enfield Council launched a safeguarding probe into the case and concluded that in the future the care home should ensure families receive the correct information about undertakers. The council, which does not run the care home, declined to comment when approached by The Mirror. Albany Park Nursing Home was approached for comment.

The fact The Queen appointed Harry as her Commonwealth Youth ambassador and that bride-to-be Meghan accompanied him to the  Commonwealth Youth Summit was proof of the confidence which she had in them both. A month later, as Meghan walked down the aisle her ft veil included hand-stitched detail depicting the flowers of every Commonwealth nation in homage to The Queenaposs Coronation gown.  Meghanaposs mother, Doria Ragland, had flown from Calornia and was the only member of her family present. Thomas did not attend saying he wanted to spare the couple any embarrassment after an incident which saw him pose for paparazzi pictures as he prepared for the big day. It was unclear why Michael, a US air force veteran and diplomat who had once secured her an internship at the US embassy in Argentina, was not invited.  But, Mr Hardman adds, the dynamics of her family certainly eclipsed the usual criticisms about the Royal Family being dysal.The book also reveals The Queen knew the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would notto royal le as soon as she learned they had left with their dogs in tow. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stunned the world when they quit their royal duties in , revealing they were starting a new le overseas.Some around the corridors of Buckingham Palace expected them to one dayto the fold, but the -year-old monarch knew dferently.

Meghan started dating Prince Harry in  and would soon meet the Queen, Prince Charles as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. After Harry and Meghanaposs engagement in , the couple gave an interview to the BBCaposs Mishal Hussein and recalled Meghanaposs first meeting with Kate. Harry said: It was exciting I mean I’ve — you know I’d been seeing her for a period of time when I literally didn’t tell anybody at all.  And then William was longing to meet her and so was Catherine, so you know, being our neighbours, we managed to get that in a couple of — well quite a few times now and Catherine has been absolutely… And Meghan with a one-word answer chipped in: Wonderful.

And we’ve had a really — she’s — she’s an incredible woman. However, since that engagement interview, a lot has changed for Harry and Meghan.

She had collapsed while she was with her daughter after she went outsideJenner Dorian Image: Jenner DorianByDanny RiggGraeme Murray:,  Mar A brain tumour caused a mum to collapse in the street while carrying her two-year-old son. Jenner Dorian, , later developed dyslexia and epilepsy after the traumatic incident, which happened outside a high street sports chain. The mum, who did a postgraduate diploma in English teaching, was forced to come to terms with feeling useless, and now has dyslexia and struggles to read and process information She woke-up confused in an ambulance after leaving Sports Direct in Southport, Merseyside, for some fresh air.Jenner told the Liverpool Echo : I wasnapost even sure what was going on and what had happened to me. I think I passed out again in the ambulance, and then woke up in hospital. There was this pattern of me waking up in hospital every couple of days when I was having these seizures. It was one of the scariest things Iaposve ever been through, to be honest. I had no idea what was going on with me and I just wanted answers.Jenner started getting really bad headaches once every couple of months when she was , but they later became more frequent until it was almost constant.They were debilitating at times, leaving Jenner bedbound and also suffering depression, anxiety and nightmares while her mental health took a hit. Collapsing in public finally forced Jenner to seek some answers. She kept having seizures almost every day during the week she spent in hospital undergoing CT and MRI scans until doctors, suspecting she had a brain tumour, referred her to a specialist neurology hospital.  She felt kind of relieved when she got a definitive diagnosis of a brain tumour. Jenner said: I know it sounds really weird, but I just wanted answers for so long as to what was going on, so when they said that, I was like, aposOkay, Iaposm not going crazy, thereaposs actually something thereapos. Obviously, I was scared at moments, but it was more a worry as I didnapost know what was going to happen with it. I didnapost knowit was going to spread, orit was going to get worse. Doctors worried it was spreading and could cause blindness when they noticed she lost a big chunk of her peripheral vision, leading to surgery in November . For a few months, that was it, until Jenner started having seizures again in March , resulting in an official epilepsy diagnosis. Jenner said:I remember really panicking that this was going to ruin my le, and I guess it did, to some extent, because I lost my job because I couldnapost work anymore in retail with epilepsy, because it was too big a risk. Then I ended up losing my home because I didnapost have the finance to fund it anymore. I was very lucky that my partner said that weaposd go and live together and heaposd help me through everything, because without that, I donapost know what would have happened.  Her story didnapost end there, or with her later dyslexia diagnosis when she went back to university for a psychology MA, motivated by her experience with a brain tumour. The seizures continue, albeit shorter and less frequent, and her one-year scan in November  revealed something on her brain, making her really, really nervous. She said: Iaposm kind of in limbo. Is this another tumour  Or is it just scar tissue  Or is it some kind of cyst on my brain thataposs formed at the surgery site  I actually got to see the scan this time, and you could just see the big hole in my brain where the previous tumour had been taken out, and then this little, white fleck in the middle of all that mass is something new thataposs growing there. Hopefully itaposs not growing at all and itaposs not going to be dangerous, but itaposs hard to say at the moment. Itaposs such a big thing to undergo, and I feel like I just got myself into a good place mentally and physically, and then itaposs like being thrown back in at the deep end all over again.Dr David Jenkinson, chief scientic officer at The Brain Tumour Charity, said: This Brain Tumour Awareness Month is a really important opportunity to highlight the need for progress on brain tumours and that we all stand united in defeating the devastation they cause.Having seizures and being diagnosed with epilepsy on top of the diagnosis of a brain tumour can be overwhelming and can cause frustration or feelings of isolation or worry, and itaposs vital that people are supported to deal with these impacts. Weaposd encourage anyone in need of more support in dealing with these impacts to talk to their doctor or specialist nurse, and you can also contact our Support and Information Line too on   . Weaposre here for you. Around , people in the UK are diagnosed with a brain tumour each year and while we have seen some encouraging steps forward in both research and care in recent years, we know progress isnapost happening fast enough and we need to act now. We need to see greater investment in world-class research now, to help diagnose the disease earlier, to better understand the causes and find new treatments, in order to give those affected hope of more time to live and a better quality of le. A cure canapost wait. As a charity, we are determined to invest another £m in forward-thinking research over the next five years to help double survival and halve the harm the disease causes. We also need to see greater support offered to anyone affected by the disease, right from the point of diagnosis. All too often we hear from people who are going through the physical, mental and financial impacts of a diagnosis and who are in need of more support.Our specialist teams are here to help with guidance on money worries, running online meet ups for young people and through Facebook support groups for those affected by a brain tumour.People handling a dficult diagnosis need to know that they are not alone and that needs to be made very clear from the start.

The woman, who described herself as a “lone parent and broke”, has told of how she decided to pop out from the office for a walk to stretch her legs when her colleague, who she doesnapost like, asked her to pick up a meal dealshe passed a shop.New to that particular office, the mum refused to buy a meal deal when she realised the only nearby shop was Marks and Spencer, where a sandwich deal would have cost around £,the Liverpool Echo reported.She explained that she never had any real intention of purchasing a lunch but when confronted, told her colleague she didnapost feel comfortable spending that much of her money without checking with her first - particularly as the colleague didnapost offer any cash upfront.Taking toMumnsetaposs popular Am I Being Unreasonable [AIBU] threadto seek advice, the mum penned: In the office the other day, I was going to stretch my legs.A colleague asked me to buy her a chicken ready mealI went near a shop. I went to Marks and Spencer to buy Percy Pigs.  The ready meals were about £. She didnapost offer me money before I went, sheaposs not in my team and I might not see her in person for months. I would probably have ended up paying for her lunch. I also donapost like her, sheaposs rude and weird and messed with my stuff once because I was using the desk she likes. Final point, Iaposm vegan and donapost want to buy chicken, but I was too chickento say that. If I liked her, I would have happily bought a meal but I would have said can I get you a veggie one instead and I wouldnapost have mindedI didnapost get paid back. I told her the meals were £ and I didnapost feel comfortable spending that much of her money without her agreement. But I never had any real intention of buying one, mostly because there were no actual supermarkets nearby anyway. Context, Iaposm a manager and she isnapost, but Iaposm a lone parent and broke as s***. So, was I a total cow[you are being unreasonable] or a diplomatic genius [you are not being unreasonable]. The mumaposs post was met with a flurry of ided responses from fellow Mumsnet users.  One Mumsnet user said: So did you tell her you’d pick up her lunch and had no intention of doing so  Yabu [you are being unreasonable], you should’ve just said ‘sorry I’m not going in a shop’ then she could’ve made other plans. Why so passive-aggressive  Another said: Weird. Presumably, she knows the price of an MS ready meal so was happy to pay that  Seems a bit mean not to get one but I guess you could have asked for the money in advance and explained that youaposre skint. A third commented: I donapost blame you, I would have just said I got sidetracked and forgot. Sometimes itaposs hard getting money back off colleagues you see every day. Donapost worry about itaposs not worth the brain space. In a follow-up response, the mum added: I said I was going for a walk. There are some shops nearby but Iaposd never been in that office before and wasnapost surethere was a Sainsburys or whatever. I didnapost have zero intention of buying it but when I realised there was only a Marks I decided I wouldnapost. Another Mumsnet user said: While I get your point, I think you should have said No straight out so that she could arrange to go out herself to buy her lunch. And another was on the mumaposs side: I think you handled it perfectly. You also subtly pointed out you WOULD be paying me back, right  for next time in case sheaposs going to ask again and then never get round to paying for it! One Mumsnet user commented: By the way Yes, I do think she was unreasonable to even ask! Iaposd barely ask a good friend without offering money, let alone a manager that I barely know. I think that shows that you would have had trouble getting the money back. Day one she has no lunch and no money, Day two sheaposs so sorry that she forgot, Day three oops forgot again, tomorrow I promise! And on and on.... until you give up. Another said: No, all she did was askyou’d pick up a ready meal as you were going out, it’s hardly rude. I Would have assumed she’d pay when you brought it back andnot immediately offered surely you just say thataposs £ please  You come across as quite petty and seem weirdly pleased with yourself about the whole thing. You knew you had no intention of buying it so you should have just said no. If you were too “chicken” to refuse then you could easily have said you weren’t planning to go into a shop or that you didn’t have cash. One Mumsnet user said: You come across as very unprofessional. All you needed to do was either say no, or get the money before you went. Itaposs not rude to say no, it is rude to say you will and then come back with nothing. And another added: I think it was poorly handled to be honest, either say no, or say yes and do it. As it was, presumably a fair chunk of lunch break was over and she then had to leave and get the lunch you said youaposd pick up. Next time why not either say no or say sure, but I donapost have any cash on me so Iaposll need the money now. At the time of writing, % of Mumsnet users voted the mum wasnapost being unreasonable.

The new rules and regulations being brought in at the beginning of April cover areas such as orce proceedings, paying taxes and receiving money from the Government. Some of them only businesses but several could affect ordinary people, too. WalesOnline reports on some of the key measures which people may not be aware of. VED rates are going up meaning a rise in car tax from April  From April , Vehicle Excise Dutywill rise in line with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation from April . But how much the cost will rise by will depend upon your vehicles emissions. For instance,your car emits no CO, your car tax will remain at . If your caraposs CO emissions are between  and g per km, your standard rate of car tax will increase from £ to £, but your first year rate will still be £.  The amount you pay also depends on how often you want to make a payment. There’s a five per cent surchargeyou pay monthly or every six months. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agencyruns computer tests every month to check whether the owners of cars registered in the UK have paid tax. New rules for traders and hauliers who move goods into Great Britain from the EU came into force on Jan  . There is still time to take action and keep your business moving. There is plenty of support on offer and the Government is ready to help you navigate your way through these new changes. Visit GOV.UK Brexit to prepare for the new rules today. If the system flags up an untaxed vehicle that is not declared SORN , the DVLA will send a fine of £ to the owner. If this is paid within  days, a  per cent discount should be applied. New orce laws will come into force from  April  On  April this year changes to the legislation on orce will come into force. The changes are part of the Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Act , which aims to reduce the potential for conflict amongst orcing couples by:removing the ability to make allegations about the conduct of a spouse allowing couples to end their marriage jointlyThe act also introduces a minimum period of  weeks between the start of proceedings and application for conditional order.  This provides couples with a meaningful period of reflection and the chance to reconsider. Where orce is inevitable, it enables couples to cooperate and plan for the future. It will also no longer be possible to contest a orce, except on limited grounds including jurisdiction.It is worth noting that, as the new changes are brought in, the current online service will be unavailable from  March . You can find out more about this on the governmentaposs website.HMRC will stop making payments to Post Office card accounts after  April  About , customers still need to switch so they don’t miss out on vital payments as HMRC will stop making payments to Post Office card accounts after  April . This means customers must noty HMRC of their new account details. Customers can choose to receive their benefit payments to a bank, building society or credit union account. If they already have an alternative account, they can contact HMRC now to update their details.If a customer misses the  April deadline, their payments will be paused until the customer noties HMRC of their new account details.Customers can also use The Money Helper website, which offers information and advice about how to choose the right current account and how to open an account.Employers will have to increase wages paid to some workers Changes in the minimum wage are in the pipeline. The Low Pay Commission made recommendations to the UK Government on what the minimum wage and living wage should be for . The UK Government accepted those recommendations and from April , , it will be law for employers to pay their staff no less than the new rates. New living wage and minimum wage rates from April  can be found on gov.uk. New tax for plastic packaging A new plastic packaging tax is coming into force in April  that will apply to all plastic packaging manufactured in the UK, or imported into the UK, that does not contain at least % recycled plastic. The government has defined plastic packaging as “packaging that is predominantly plastic by weight” and the new tax will not apply to any plastic packaging which containing at least  per cent recycled plastic or any packaging.  Imported plastic packaging will be liable to the tax whether the packaging is unfilled or filled. The Government says the new tax aims to “provide a clear economic incentive for businesses to use recycled plastic in the manufacture of plastic packaging” and should lead to increased levels of recycling and collection of plastic waste, saving much of it from going to landfill. The new law will take effect from April . Accountancy firm Harold Duckworth reports the rate of tax will be £ per metric tonne of plastic packaging. Changes in corporation tax Companies and unincorporated associations that pay corporation tax will be affected by changes which come into effect on April , . HM Revenue and Customs has set the “main rate” for corporation tax for all non-ring-fenced profits to  per cent for the financial year that begins on April , , increasing to  per cent of profits over £, from April , . A small profits ratewill also be introduced at this time for companies with profits of £, or less so that they will continue to pay corporation tax at  per cent. Households urged to get ready for £ council tax rebateHouseholds across England are being urged to set up direct debits with their local council to receive a council tax rebate that will help millions of families manage costs of living.People who pay council tax by direct debit will see the cash go directly into their bank accounts from April. Those who do not pay by direct debit will be contacted by their council and invited to make a claim. Around  million households in council tax bands A to D - including  per cent of rented properties - are set to benefit from the £ billion council tax rebate, which does not have to be repaid.  It is part of a package of government measures to help families with rising energy costs. An extra £ million will also be given to councils to provide discretionary support to vulnerable households who may not qualy for the £ council tax rebate. This includes people on low incomes in council tax bands E to H.According to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Rt Hon Michael Gove : As we emerge from the pandemic, we understand the pressures facing many families as global inflation levels increase.The support we have introduced will help millions of people, particularly those on the lowest incomes and the most vulnerable. We continue to stand behind the British people and I urge everyone who is eligible to claim this rebate to do so. Changes to fuel Red diesel and rebated biofuels will become illegal from April , which will mainly affect users of off-road vehicles such as bulldozers and cranes. The change is being made to help the UK meet its  climate commitments.

Her Majesty, who usually resides in London, has been working from home at Windsor Castle for the last two years since the pandemic began.And now with more health concerns having recently caught Covid- and suffering from more mobility issues, the -year-old is said to have decided to make Windsor her official residence.Buckingham Palace, which has been the official royal residence since , is currently undergoing a £million refurbishment which is due to be completed in .  When the renovations began, it was planned that the Queen would only moved out of her private apartments temporarily. But since then, it has been decided that she will vacate the Palace for good to minimise her travel, with it also no longer deemed suitable for a long-term home, The Times reports. Itaposs understood the Queen will also permanently work from home at Windsor Castle. The record-breaking monarch will celebrate her th birthday this year, and was reported to have said that she “couldn’t move” as she leaned on her walking stick at a meeting at the Castle last month. Last October, the Queen was advised to rest for several weeks on doctor’s orders, after going for tests at hospital for an unspecied illness. She also tested positive for Covid- last month, experiencing “light symptoms” while she continued to carry out “light duties”. The Queen spent much of lockdown at Windsor with Prince Philip until his death in April last year. It is expected that Her Majesty willand “be visible” at Buckingham Palace for festivities such as the Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year.For her birthday on June , she will still appear in the balcony of the central London residence. And the Union Jack, which flies to signy the monarch is not at the Palace, will now remain permanently, disappointing any tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of her while visiting London. During the pandemic, the Queen did not switch her residence seasonally as normal, where she typically ummer with family at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire and takes up residence at her Norfolk estate, Sandringham, from December until mid-February. Her next event outside Windsor Castle is the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on, this month on March .

Georgette Winslow was born with a full head of luscious hair that has continued to grow directly upwards and has captured the hearts of family and friends.Mum, Jenni Winslow, , said that despite the four-month-old rocking an envious amount of hair, she wasnapost surprised because Georgetteaposs locks had previously been picked up on baby scans.Georgette has even been compared to cartoon character Jimmy Neutron, who is known for his iconic spike.Jenni, who has two other children, debunked the old wivesapos tale that heartburn in pregnancies means hairy babies because she never suffered from the condition. Jenni, from South Dakota, US, said: Because she has Downaposs syndrome, we were going in for regular scans, and the technician would always say aposoh my god she has loads of hair!aposIt was hard to see how much hair she had when was born, but once sheaposd had a little wash you could tell there was loads. We were in the NICU for a while when she was born, and all the nurses would come in and say everyone had told them to come and see her hair.  Jenni says Georgetteaposs hilarious likliness to the cartoon character was first spotted by her mum, but that friends soon agreed. I was just talking to my mum one day and she said her hair reminded her of a cartoon character, she said. It was until later I found a picture of Jimmy Neutron, and I could totally see what she meant. I posted a photo of them side-by-side, and all my friends said they had thought the exact same thing. Jenniaposs other children, Viola, six, and three-year-old Sullivan were also born with hair, as was husband Barrett, . She said: Sullivan was born with old man hair, he had a bald patch at the top of his head. Violaaposs hair was similar to Georgetteaposs, but it wasnapost as thick or as long as hers. Now, Georgetteaposs has just kept growing.  Jenni, a personal trainer from South Dakota, US, says everyone immediately falls in love with Georgetteaposs hair. She says sheaposs alos attempted to style her hair, but without much success. She said: After her bath, I just let it dry naturally and it always sticks up like that because itaposs so fluffy. I have been tempted to put it in a ponytail but I only did that once. I was scared about pulling her skin too much so we only left it up for a minute before I let it loose again.

He said you need to pick the right eggs, use certain types of pans, and Jordanaposs also added a few other little-known hacks to help get them just right. What do you think of Jordanaposs tips  Let us know in the comments...Jordan said: To avoid the egg-white spreading through the water, always opt for the freshest eggs possible. As eggs get older, the whites get more liquid, meaning you run the risk of the whites spreading around your pan. If you do have older eggs spare don’t let them go to waste, they are perfect for making soft boiled and hard-boiled eggs. A drop of vinegar or lemon juice in your water can really help the whites to set up and envelop the yolk fully. The acid reacts with the egg-white, allowing it to firm up more quickly, rather than spreading through the water. Don’t use too much though. A teaspoonful is a perfect amount to avoid leaving an acidic taste on your poached eggs. Jordan also said you have to be careful to get the water to the right temperature, asit boils too vigorously it will rip the egg apart. He continued: Vigorously boiling water can cause the egg to tear and break. Instead, look for small bubbles at the bottom of the pan so you know you’ve got the right temperature. To achieve the perfect poaching temperature bring the water to the boil and then reduce to simmer. Not only do the small bubbles mean you’ve got the heat right, they can also stop your egg from hitting the bottom of the pan and sticking. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Use a really deep pan for that classic tear-drop shape. To help you get perfect poached eggs, use a really deep stockpot, full to the brim with simmering water. Forget the whirlpool and vinegar technique this time, and simply drop your eggs into the water. “As the depth of the pan is so great, the egg white will wrap around the yolk before it hits the bottom, leaving you with a gorgeous shape, perfect for eggs benedict or topping avocado on toast. Poaching an egg in shallow water will create a flat-shaped egg.” The chef advised: “Doing this will help the eggs form a more spherical shape. The eggs transferring from a cold to hot temperature will increase the chances of a runny yolk yet keeping the firm consistency of the whites, as it slows the cooking time of the yolk, whilst letting the whites cook completely.” Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON StepsFood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As first reported by North Wales Live, the group entered the tunnel through a heavy steel lidded manhole and climbed down steel steps. Then they tried to cross to the other side of the bridge.The space was described as claustrophobic and the distance from one end of the tunnel to the other was surprisingly long. At the halfway point, the explorers say they were able to look down through narrow gaps onto the motorway below which helped keep them calm, in a strange way. However, that feeling was about to change dramatically.Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The group recalled seeing objects in the distance at the far end of the tunnel, so they carried on further. They explained: We reached the end, and let me tell you, We have never felt the same sense of dread before or since. In front of us was a single fold-away chair positioned facing a wall.  On the wall was a partially torn page from a newspaper, or a magazine, showing a fully naked lady in an erotic position. I canapost put my finger on it but it seemed more sinister than sexythat makes any sense. The scene that lay before us had rendered us completely speechless, and an overpowering sense of panic could be felt collectively. They went on to say that the whole thing made them want to leave as fast as humanly possible. Needless to say we got out of tunnel, as fast as humanly possible, smashing our knees and shins against the sharp cement edges, that lined the path to the ladder by which we had entered, they added. Of course, we were all praying to God that the man-hole hadnapost been re-sealed, as it was impossible to tell until you reached the ladder itself.

At apos, Julia is only slightly taller than apos Kylie, and youaposd be forgiven for thinking you were looking at the real deal.Although sheaposs yet to match Kylieaposs  million Instagram followers, Julia has carved out a signicant social media presence, boasting , followers on Instagram where she goes by the username @juju.brazil. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Julia receives many messages from people calling her the Brazilian Kylie Jenner, but finds that attention ies depending on whether sheaposs in the UK or Brazil. The cam model said: “I think itaposs funny because a lot of people around here [London] think I look like her. It was only since I moved to the UK four years ago that I started to get told it. I think in Brazil thereaposs a similar kind of look, so people donapost point it out. However, being Kylieaposs doppelganger certainly has its disadvantages, with Julia having previously been told that her looks can be intimidating.She explained: People tell me Iaposm intimidating to approach. Probably because I have a resting b***h face. Then when they speak to me I start smiling and they realise Iaposm friendly. To be honest I think people use it as an excuse to talk to me.When I do a TikTok people even use the resemblance as a cuss. They call me the Walmart Kylie Jenner. But to be honest thataposs still a compliment. She is stunning.The thing is people think I try to look like her on purpose but I donapost. However, while they certainly look similar, Julia notes that their taste in men dfers somewhat, revealing: All my ex-boyfriends have had the same kind of look. All blue eyes and blonde hair. I do think Travis [Scott] is good-looking but heaposs not my normal type. Juliaaposs many Instagram followers just canapost get over the similarities, with one person writing, Oh my goodness, Kylie Jenner is you  Iaposm shocked, you really look like Kylie Jenner, absolutely stunning.

However, their presence is still very much felt in every room, with forgotten possessions scattered about on floors and tables.

Itaposs easy to imagine that this was once a very pleasant place to live.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Footage of the exterior and interior of the property has been shared by Meg, a New York-based urban explorer who documents decay and abandonment.Meg, who goes by the TikTok username _mydarlingone_, had been passing through a very old historic town when visiting the eerie property, which sheaposs described as a beauty.As far as Megaposs aware, sheaposs the first urban explorer to set foot in the place. The footage shows Meg wandering around the large property - which she says was once a hoarderaposs house - observing the many personal items left behind.Meg was only able to piece together some semblance of who the previous occupants were after coming across their old driversapos licenses, degree certicates and business cards. Old fashioned ornaments can be seen cluttering up one shelf, while childhood photographs were found nestled among the personal effects. A floral clock still hangs on the wall above a fireplace, while bottles of liquor gather dust in the dingy corners. Meg says she could have spent hours just looking at the book collection, which included a number of books from iconic horror writer Anne Rice. The urban explorer added: Iaposm not sure why everything was left behind but they had quite a aposcollectionapos, later remarking in the comments section that there was so much treasure. They definitely liked to collect antiques. Despite the decay, the loveliness of the house still lingers, and many of Megaposs followers have been left besotted with it, expressing great sadness at its sorry state of disrepair. One person remarked that it was an amazing time capsule of lives lived, adding that it should be preserved as it is, while another described it as an antique collectoraposs dream.

The TikToker found the terrying discovery behind a wall in the attic of his Welsh home. He had been trying to plug the gaps of a wall in his home with insulation material when he spotted something behind the bricks. It was part of a renovation project which he had been recording on the social networking  TikTok. But TikTok user @geebeetv made a chilling discovery behind a bricked-up wall in his attic. North Wales Live reports he discovered a locked wooden box, with a pentagram carved on one side of the box, and the words peidiwch ar ryddhau in Welsh which roughly translates to do not release. A week later, while continuing renovating the room he noticed a mirror in the corner that rattled when he moved it, but the edges had been sealed shut. Curiosity got the better of him so he took a hammer and smashed the glass - a move which according to superstition brings seven years of bad luck. Behind the mirror, someone had hidden the key to the locked chest found earlier.According to their most recent clip, million people watched the video clips and hundreds of people warned the man to leave the box alone. But others, like him, were dying to see what was inside and were fascinated by the mystery. Some really strange objects were inside, including a small pendant necklace and a burned piece of an ouija board.A lock of hair and a second key were also left inside the box - raising the questionthere is a second key, is there a second box  Thousands of people commented on the ious clips, with some calling the videos staged, while others are terried by what they’ve seen.

As the Russian President vows to press on with the invasion, Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said the invasion in Ukraine is not going well for the Kremlin.He added Putinaposs forces are in a mess with eight Russian aircraft shot down in one day, losing , troops a day and a huge convoy of , soldiers and hundreds of vehicles at a standstill. Asked whether Russia taking over Ukraine was aposinevitableapos, Sir Tony told the BBC: No. I think weaposve seen a Russian invasion that is not going well. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog  I think weaposre also seeing remarkable resistance by Ukraine, both its armed forces and its people and weaposre seeing the unity of the whole globe coming together, applying pressure to Russia. Russia is suffering, Russia is an isolated power. It is less powerful than it was ten days ago. Some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response.Youaposve also seen basic failures in terms of maintenance and their kit failing. Russia hasnapost operated at this scale since the Second World War and it is incredibly complex and dficult. However, he said the key call of Kyiv - a no-fly zone - would not help those on the ground.Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly called for a no-fly zone but Putin warned that imposing one would be considered participation in the armed conflict. Nato has ruled it out as the alliance fears it would spark a wider conflict.General Philip Breedlove, a former Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told Times Radio allies should enforce a humanitarian no-fly zone, with dferent rules of engagement than a military one whereby we talk to our enemy, and we say, we are not going to fire on you unless you fire on us.On Sunday, Ukrainian newspaper The Kyiv Independent reported the countryaposs President Volodymyr Zelensky had reiterated his demand as he said: The world has the power to close our skies for Russian rockets and aircraft.Sir Tony told the BBCaposs Sunday Morning programme: The advice that we as senior military professionals are giving our politicians is to avoid doing things that are tactically ineffective and definitely to avoid doing things that tactically might lead to miscalculation or escalation. The no-fly zone would not help. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.On Sunday, February , Ukraineaposs health minister reported that at least  Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than , wounded. On March , Ukraine claimed to have killed , Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently veried but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than  civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least  people have been killed, including  children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. It comes as Ukraineaposs President accused Russia of aposstate terrorismapos on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv.  Most of the shelling is coming from artillery, most of the destruction is coming from artillery, itaposs not coming from Russian aircraft. If we were to police a no-fly zone, it means that we probably have to take out Russian defence systems and we would have Nato aircraft in the air alongside Russian aircraft, and then the potential of shooting them down and then that leads to an escalation.The view was echoed by Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, who said it would be very dficult, very challenging, but added we will do everything short of that to support Ukrainians. Weaposre not going to get ourselves into a direct military conflict with Putin because that would be a massive escalation, but also that feeds Putinaposs narrative, he told Trevor Phillips On Sunday on Sky News.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told ITV News: Everybody understands why we canapost have a no-fly zone, why direct military assistance is not possible. That means sanctions have to be the strongest we have ever seen, the most effective weaposve ever seen.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Russia Ukraine warLabour PartyNatoBBCWorld War Trevor PhillipsVladimir PutinSoldiersPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The brave Ukrainian president has also already turned down rescue offers, saying: I need ammunition, not a ride, in response to American forces.It comes as Zelensky confirmed he spoke to the US President, Joe Biden, discussing security, financial support and continuation of sanctions against Russia. As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with the President, Zelensky wrote on Twitter.Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Around  UK elite soldiers and  US Navy Seals are training for a rescue mission alongside Ukrainian forces, The Sun reports.“The most likely sensible option could be to relocate Zelensky out of Kyiv where he could be picked up. We have aircraft but the distance is critical,” a senior source said.It comes as Vladimir Putin said Western sanctions were akin to a declaration of war, as his forces pressed their assault on Ukraine on Saturday for a th day.The Kremlin said the West was behaving like a bandit by cutting economic relations and Putin warned any attempt to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would lead to catastrophic consequences for the world.Meanwhile, Israelaposs Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with Putin in the Kremlin to discuss the Ukraine crisis, then spoke with Zelensky by phone.Israel has offered to mediate in the conflict.And refugees keep pouring out of the country with number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion predicted to rise to . million by the end of the weekend, the head of the UN refugee agency s aid.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to

trees, due to high winds in Drumlemble, and we planted them in January.The apples are two x Golden Spur, two x Redspur and, pears are two x Lilliput Dwarf.With fruit trees, there is also the benefit of fresh fruit in years to come, either for us or future residents in our home.In response to Alex McKinven’s letter in the February  edition of the Courier titled ‘Any Dalintober developments must be sensitive’, hopefully I can give an assurance on behalf of Argyll Community Housing Association .Despite the merits or otherwise of a debate on aesthetic value with respect to the Dalintober buildings, they do not meet the needs of ACHA’s current or future tenants for a iety of reasons around layout and energy efficiency.ACHA is committed,demolition is permitted, to build  high-quality family homes, built sensitively in this outstanding seafront location.In reference to the gap sites at Saddell Street and Queen Street, ACHA does plan to bring these sites back in to community use and will consult on that in the very near future.That will be consistent with what we did when we demolished properties in central Campbeltown and replaced them with  family homes at New Parliament Place, Park Square, Longrow and McCallum Street.ACHA is committed as a partner of Argyll and Bute Council to do all we can to complete the direction of travel of regeneration in central Campbeltown over the

birthday in December this year,I am still here, I can look forward to a further increase in my state pension of  pence per week.Any suggestions as to what I should spend this welcome amount on Never mind, when the SNP and Greens obtain independence, they will be able to increase my pension from their abundant resources.Then again, all the SNP’s money trees have been blown down in the recent

Trezise said it would be the first time he had performed on Arran since staging a school show on the island more than  years ago.He also has fond memories as a child coming to Arran from Cupar in Fe and it was here that he learned to ride a bike.He said: #The show is nostalgia for adults and fun for kids. Bring granny too. We promise not to #Shove Granny off the Bus#.#The Singing Kettle was formed in the early s by Artie and his we Cilla Fisher. Very soon they were joined by Gary Coupland and the three stalwarts were the backbone of the company for more than  years.From the very start Singing Kettle shows have been based on clues for songs inside brightly coloured kettles with the famous chant: #Spout, handle, lid of metal. What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

Estate.The new Launder-Aide venture offers a same-day laundry and ironing service, with pick-up and delivery included.‘We had been looking for new premises for some time and the unit has everything we need,’ said Joan Stewart, Shopper-Aide project manager.The building has been altered to suit Shopper-Aide’s needs, with the creation of a reception office space, a group meeting room, a private office and accessible toilets, in addition to the laundry room that was already in the building.There is also a kitchen where Shopper-Aide hopes to make soup which will be sold to the public twice a week.While there are still some small additions to be made to the building, Joan said Andrew Smith, Shopper-Aide’s new landlord, and local tradesmen who have carried out work so far, have been ‘brilliant’ in helping get things up and running.When Shopper-Aide was first set up, to help people aged  and over with their grocery shopping, it was dependent on external funders to operate and pay staff salaries.Over the years, as it began to offer more services including household support, a befriending service and organising social clubs like Elderberries and Garry’s Gang according to clients’ needs and abilities, the charity introduced new initiatives to help generate its own funds.These include selling crafts created by clients at its art and crafts clubs and donated second-hand books and other items.The importance of Shopper-Aide has been highlighted during the Covid pandemic, with its outstanding work in the community earning it a Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service, the UK#s highest award for volunteers.During the first lockdown, the charity’s shopping client-base more than doubled, but an influx of volunteers who were unable to work due to Covid restrictions supported the charity to cope with the increased demand.Volunteers also helped Shopper-Aide to continue providing entertainment to older people throughout lockdown, despite not being able to hold its regular groups, by organising virtual afternoon teas and quizzes and a poetry competition.A ‘Phone Buddies’ system was also set-up, offering one-to-one phone-calls to clients.The charity encouraged its clients to knit squares as part of its ‘lockdown blankets’ project. These were then sewed into blankets which have been donated to three dferent charities to help homeless people.‘During lockdown, it was brought to our attention that it wasn’t only older people with dficulties who struggled,’ Joan said. ‘Everyone felt loneliness.‘To that end, we want to invite everyone, including older people, to come and help us at Shopper-Aide, to help support their community.‘Our volunteers come from all walks of le and are truly tremendous. We wouldn’t be where we are today without them.‘Just an hour a week of someone’s spare time would make an amazing dference to us.’Shopper-Aide is looking for volunteers across all areas of the charity’s work, although it should be noted that people must be aged  or over to drive Shopper-Aide’s vehicles.Garry’s Gang, a men-only group that meets twice a week, was the first to resume when Covid restrictions allowed.One attendee told Shopper-Aide staff: ‘I’m not going to die of Covid, I’m going to die of loneliness.’That is why the charity is keen to restart its social groups as soon as possible, initially in bubbles to ensure safety.‘The last two years, we’ve been on hold, the same the rest of society,’ said Joan, ‘but we’re starting to open our wings and are looking forward to getting back to the new normal.’Shopper-Aide has three full-time and  part-time staff who assist and coordinate volunteers.‘Our staff are very committed,’ Joan said. ‘They all do a brilliant job and go above and beyond what’s asked of them.‘The Shopper-Aide family is committed to supporting each other, and we want to become more resilient should something like Covid ever happen again.’As well as volunteering, people can also support the charity by becoming a ‘Shopper-Aide Friend’ by donating £ a year infor newsletters and the knowledge that they’re supporting a charity within the community.Call   or visit Shopper-Aide’s website or Facebook page for more information on the new laundry service or to support the charity."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 4 2022","story":"We have recently moved to Carradale, and are loving it!I wrote this poem in praise of our new home.Carradale, O Carradale,Room to stretch, peace to workThe south might say it’s grim up northMay our days be long and all spent hereI urge you alltired and stressedThe story’s just startingTo quote a French poet, Charles Baudelaire,Best wishes.Living in a Campbeltown flat, one up from the street, with only one flat above using the same toilet waste downpipe, I was amazed tohome to find a previous #deposit# still in my toilet.My attempt to clear and flush caused the toilet basin to fill to the brim with #dirty# water etcetera and white paper.The emergency plumbers were called and two good men arrived but efforts to clear the toilet basin in the flat failed.At ground level outside, they effected an entry into the said downpipe and pulled out unpleasant #deposits# and many many wet wipes – which I do not use.They claimed to have previously attended similarly choked toilets with wet wipes.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

That is within expectations but what that does do is underpins the  date so I think we are more confident now that that will be the date.“One success we got from the Hunterston end-of-generation is we managed to find a job for everybody who wanted to stay here.“The staff levels do go down, there’s no doubt about it, but I’ve just done it.“Hunterston was the first station of the AGR [advanced gas-cooled reactor] fleet to reach the end of generation. I was there, I saw it all, so I’m well positioned to help Torness on their journey. We will be starting our preparations for that in the next couple of years.”Once the station stops generating power, attention will turn to defueling the reactors.That process is expected to take more than three years and will require hundreds of members of staff.Mr Forrest succeeded Tam Al Bishawi, who has moved to EDF’s new Hinkley C power station in Somerset after  years over two spells at the station.However, the -year-old is no stranger to Torness.He has lived in nearby Dunbar for more than  years and has a connection with the power station dating back more than  years.He was involved in the construction and commissioning of the station and has held ious roles, including operations manager and technical and safety manager.He was also plant manager at Torness for nearly two years from December  to September , when he was appointed acting station director at Hunterston B, near West Kilbride in Ayrshire.The “strong supporter” of nuclear power felt that Torness had an important role to play in the years ahead.The father-of-three said: “I will be painting that picture and, as I said, at Hunterston we managed to find a job for everybody who wanted to stay. If I can replicate that, it would be a real success.“That will be one of my main focuses but right now we are generating electricity for about a quarter of Scotland’s electricity needs and that is low-carbon electricity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"controlled-explosion-item-address-west-barns","story":"An official police statement to the Courier yesterday said that bomb disposal experts had carried out the controlled explosion on Tuesday - but that information was wrong.Apologising for any inconvience caused, a Police Scotland statement this morning said: \"Information initially provided relating to a controlled explosion at the address was inaccurate.

Seating areas boast a selection of large leather couches and intimate tables of two – both of which offer stunning views of the waters that make North Berwick so popular.The hotel embraces the beauty of the wilderness on its front door, with interiors pulling from the agricultural and architectural history of the area. Local heritage is displayed through framed prints of wildle found on the Bass Rock. The refurbished style is reminiscent of F.

Main courses include options of venison, halibut and duck breast.The quality of the food is a definite selling point I’d recommend the haggis bonbons to start, while the Tweed valley beef with Chimichurri sauce makes for an admirable main course.The only distraction in the dining area was the rather bleak music played throughout dinner. Additionally, I would recommend a late dinner, with the atmosphere of the eatery heating up at around pm.Breakfast is a generous premium buffet served in the restaurant with an additional menu of warm and cooked items the French toast is not to be missed. From my understanding, the pastries on offer at the buffet are made in house and the best I’ve ever eaten.The overall dining experience at The Lawn was high class, most of all due to the eagerness and humour of our server. If you visit The Lawn, with or without a booked stay at The Marine, always ask for Richie!Cocktails created by talented bar staff are the perfect dinner treat Staff are faultless in their presentation, their unorm neat and matching they’re eager to help and accommodate.Marine Hotel North Berwick Without a doubt, the staff are among the most polite and caring I have ever met.

But she wasnt asleep, her laughs had triggered cataplexy, a symptom of narcolepsy, which meant that despite appearances, she was wide awake.Mrs McFarlane, , who lives in Jordanhill, said: “I was laughing and within a split second it looked like I was asleep, but I was lying there and I couldn’t move any muscles. It was horrible. I was still awake and conscious, but I was essentially trapped in my body.”She says she first noticed things were not right in , while she was on maternity leave with her third child and was struggling to stay awake. She then noticed that emotions, such as laughter or smiling could trigger an attack. Her face muscles would droop and her legs would give way. In her job, teaching children with additional needs at Hazelwood School, she would retreat to the staff toilets where she would end up asleep. People would talk to her and she would struggle to stay awake and she had to give up driving the school bus.She said: “It was horrendous. When I laughed, I had a kind of shutdown, asI had rebooted in a split second. Like the power had gone out and come back on again.\"I had to stop watching funny things on TV and avoiding funny situations with the kids.“It saw part of me disappear. I even had to learn toas a dferent kind of mum to the one that I was.”It is estimated that around , people in the UK suffer from narcolepsy, which is a recognised disability and can also cause vivid dreams, poor memory, automatic behaviour and obesity.The teacher sought help from her GP and in , was referred to a specialist team at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where she was finally diagnosed. While there’s no cure for the condition, the team worked to find out the best clinical treatment, as well as other support required to help Heather keep her job and live a more ‘normal’ le.Margaret Docherty, a nurse practitioner at the sleep clinic, has been pioneering treatment approaches, with her expertise sought by colleagues across Europe. She said: “Narcolepsy can be completely devastating for people’s lives. It’s about finding the right treatment and support for the person, everything from psychological support, to medication and understanding their lives and needs. My driver is how we can improve things for people – that’s what matters.”The team prescribed Sodium Oxybate, a puried form of GHB, which depresses the central nervous system, as part of a range of treatments to help Heather stay awake during the day and asleep at night.“It was a game-changer in lots of dferent ways,” added Heather. “I’ve been able to get some of my le back.”Dr Eric Livingston, Respiratory Consultant and Clinical lead at the clinic, said: “When we get the medication right, it can transform lives, allowing people to drive their cars again, or get back to work or university – instead of people thinking they are tired or lazy.“Some people have been told for  years that they are lazy, before they even get a diagnosis, but we can support and get them back to a full le again.”Dr Livingston paid tribute to his team, not least Margaret. He added: “I deal with the narcolepsy and clinical symptoms, but the service Margaret provides is unique. \"She can see the big picture about how it impacts on people’s lives. She has done amazing work with these patients and, along with our service being a pioneer in providing new medications, it’s really making a positive dference.\"Mrs McFarlane, has been supported by her colleagues and remains at work – with a beanbag on hand, in case it’s needed for her less frequent attacks. She’s also found ways to smile and laugh again.She added: “The team have been amazing.

This is more complicated than it seems: many delays are actually caused by, for instance, the customer not understanding that a utility bill more than three months old isn’t a valid proof of address. Accordingly, we’ve taken pains to catalogue our own experiences as well as dozens of documented complaints against each casino. Both the average cashout time and how long it takes to resolve any issues were taken into account.In addition and as with all our reviews, the safety and security of users are fundamental and often what distinguish the best fast-withdrawal casinos from fly-by-night operators.

Like countless others watching the invasion unfold on the news, from a position of safety, we are deeply moved and appeal for your urgency in introducing sanctions on Russian activity in the UK.#We appeal to you to take immediate action to address the activity of state-owned Russian vessels in UK waters at this time, in particular the activities by Sovcomflot oil tankers in the Northern Isles of Scotland. We are aware of the vessel NS Challenger, owned by Sovcomflot, which was permitted to take on cargo at Sullom Voe Oil terminal, in Shetland on the February .#Following the media statements from Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, another Sovcomflot vessel NS Champion has cancelled its berth in Scapa Flow, Orkney on the March , .#It is with our disappointment that sanctions were not imposed prior to this Sovcomflot activity in Shetland, however we hope that similar commercial activity in our waters is restricted in future.#We, the undersigned, fully support the UK Government extending sanctions to mody the obligations of Open Port Duty, Section  of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act , to be applied to the activity of Russian state-owned vessels and their use of UK ports.#Elected members of Orkney Islands Council, as the Orkney Harbour Authority, continue to uphold the Port Marine Safety Code and the obligations covered by the Pilotage Act .#The letter was signed by all  councillors.

Turn your thermostat down by C and put on a jumper instead of overheating the house.Q: What is climate change and how can we stop it in Northern Ireland A: Climate change is measured over long time periods and is the long-term change in weather, whether local, regional or global.The dference now is the pace of change caused by us all putting more carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmospherethat result in increased temperatures over time.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Here, it will mean more extreme weather events such as flooding, damaging winds, and droughts.Everyone globally has to play their part, but the onus falls more on parts of the world where we are creating most of the problem, and that includes us.Reducing the effects of climate change for future generations requires immediate action including switching to renewable energy, investing in public transport, insulating all our homes , adopting a circular economy and creating less waste.Q: Does our government do enough to safeguard the environmental future A: Our government is no dferent to nearly every other country around the world, in that we are doing too little to protect our environment, whether in relation to climate change, nature recovery or tackling pollution.That said, there is a lot of legislation and there are many strategies in the pipeline in Northern Ireland that are going to help speed up work in all these areas.Governments cannot tackle this on their own, though. We need businesses to buy in to accelerating changes to the ways they work, and we need all of us to understand that this really is an emergency.Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate ChangeEnvironment In Focus: Dromore Rugby Club plant trees to neutralise  miles of travelling for away games PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsThe -year-old nun that’s standing with our youth to help fight climate changeRosalind SkillenOpinionHow green is your candidate  Why it’s so vital to quiz politicians when they ask for your voteStormont’s move towards first climate bill encouraging, says NI campaignerMost ReadIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospitalNorthern Ireland cop John Fleming facing jail over cruelty to pet dogs caught on dashcamNorthern Ireland completely unprepared for nuclear strike, warns Cold War bunker ownerUDA-linked drug enforcer and far-right thug to join Georgian Legion to fight RussiansRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerPlayWatch: Piano player lightens mood at Ukrainian refugee camp with #Somewhere Over the Rainbow# PlayVideo: Russian Army choir #abducted# while singing  Spectre theme songLatest EnvironmentEnvironment In Focus: Dromore Rugby Club plant trees to neutralise  miles of travelling for away gamesClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsThe -year-old nun that’s standing with our youth to help fight climate changeRosalind SkillenOpinionHow green is your candidate  Why it’s so vital to quiz politicians when they ask for your voteStormont’s move towards first climate bill encouraging, says NI campaignerLatestRussia sets cease-fire for evacuations amid heavy shellingVisas granted for fleeing Ukrainians will rise ‘very quickly’, says ministerIrish families ‘will have to open their homes to Ukrainian refugees’One dead after fishing vessel capsizes off NorwayCovid deaths surpass six million but some believe true figure may be .m,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rather than lessening exposure to the harsh winds that whip around the pitch though, these new saplings have been planted with a view to offsetting the carbon footprint of the side’s first XV on their travels.Playing in Kukri Championship One, the County Down side rack up their fair share of miles with trips to the likes of Enniskillen and Clogher Valley on the fixture list and it was such y journeys that got clubman Peter Dickson thinking about the side’s impact on the environment.“I work for Bridgestone, who have a good relationship with rugby through their advertising at Ravenhill and things like that,” he says. “And they’ve been involved with Dromore for quite a while too.“At Bridgestone, we’re a company that is very into sustainability and we invest heavily in that. Working in the corporate world really gave me an insight into how important it is for companies to take their responsibilities seriously and the idea that every organisation has to do its part.“So I was sitting in a Starbucks one day thinking about how Dromore Rugby Club could do its own part and develop a sustainability programme. What would be realistic for us to do  And thinking about it, as a club where we generate most of our carbon footprint is from our travel. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I got Google Maps out, clocked up all our miles, looked at things like the average Co emission per vehicle, the number of people we take to games and things like that. “And it worked out that we had a total of  miles in the league, which meant that it seemed to be that throughout the season we’d have emissions of about six tonnes. It takes six trees to offset one tonne so we were looking at  trees to come out neutral and we rounded that up to .“I went to Bridgestone who gave us a bit of money, and the Old Mill Nursery in Dromore gave us the trees, and from there this idea born in a coffee shop got to where we are now.“We put some of the trees in our grounds, because it all starts at the club, but whether it was farmers, guys who were building houses, whatever, it was so, so easy to get rid of the rest.“You’d don’t struggle to give things away in Dromore, that’s something learned.”While they’ll look to repeat the initiative year after year to offset each season’s travel, this is only a small part of the club’s plans. They have already installed LED floodlights with a view to cutting down on their electricity usage, a move which has cost-saving benefits as well as environmental ones, and their next project later this year will look at the carbon footprint of their clubhouse with the possibility of new heating systems being explored. “If you were building a clubhouse  years ago, sustainability wasn’t something that you would have considered,” adds Dickson. “But today,you’re not considering sustainability you’re not being responsible.”As the club sees it, that responsibility extends not just to crunching the numbers, but in educating their members too.“The mini-rugby club has got involved and they’ve embraced it,” Dickson says. “It’s been great to get them out with a shovel planting trees.“It shows them what they need to do. When they’re grown up, in  years, they’ll have a responsibility too to look after the next generation.“There’s kids in the community that look to Dromore Rugby Club and see us as leaders and it’s important for us to take on that responsibility and show the way.“We’re an amateur sports club, and obviously we want to go out and win on a Saturday, but there’s nothing more important to a club like ourselves than the people and the community. “Projects like these are a big part of that.”Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate Change PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsThe -year-old nun that’s standing with our youth to help fight climate changeRosalind SkillenOpinionHow green is your candidate  Why it’s so vital to quiz politicians when they ask for your voteStormont’s move towards first climate bill encouraging, says NI campaignerInvasion will be an environmental disaster for both Ukraine and rest of worldMost ReadIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospitalNorthern Ireland cop John Fleming facing jail over cruelty to pet dogs caught on dashcamNorthern Ireland completely unprepared for nuclear strike, warns Cold War bunker ownerUDA-linked drug enforcer and far-right thug to join Georgian Legion to fight RussiansRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerPlayWatch: Piano player lightens mood at Ukrainian refugee camp with #Somewhere Over the Rainbow# PlayVideo: Russian Army choir #abducted# while singing  Spectre theme songLatest EnvironmentClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsThe -year-old nun that’s standing with our youth to help fight climate changeRosalind SkillenOpinionHow green is your candidate  Why it’s so vital to quiz politicians when they ask for your voteStormont’s move towards first climate bill encouraging, says NI campaignerInvasion will be an environmental disaster for both Ukraine and rest of worldLatestRussia sets cease-fire for evacuations amid heavy shellingVisas granted for fleeing Ukrainians will rise ‘very quickly’, says ministerIrish families ‘will have to open their homes to Ukrainian refugees’One dead after fishing vessel capsizes off NorwayCovid deaths surpass six million but some believe true figure may be .m,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGreen Party NI leader Clare Bailey pictured.March   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPoliticians are increasing recognising that immediate and decisive action on the climate crisis will not only influence votes — it will win votes.Indeed, for many Northern Irish voters, climate action will be one of the defining issues in the upcoming MLA elections in May.With these elections fast approaching, many candidates have already started leafleting and door-knocking. However, when a candidate knocks at your door, what questions should you ask them  More importantly, how do you know whether they are genuinely serious about what they propose To gain a deeper sense of the candidate’s knowledge and understanding of climate breakdown, begin the conversation in the context of the broader political landscape.There are currently two climate bills passing through the Northern Irish Assembly. These are subject to ongoing debates, reviews and amendments. Both bills have a target of net zero emissions. Yet while the Private Members’ Billaims for Northern Ireland to be net zero by , the Executive Billaims for .Read MoreClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsYou could therefore start by asking the following question: which bill do they support Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Given how both bills aim for Northern Ireland to be net zero, despite ying target dates, a good follow-up question would be to ask how their party hopes to achieve this. How will they get us there  What is their political strategy  What concrete steps will they take to help Northern Ireland reach net zero Northern Ireland is not only the last nation in western Europe to implement climate legislation, but we also rank th worst in the world for bioersity loss. Nature recovery is therefore integral to an ambitious climate strategy.It is therefore crucial to ask the candidate about how they plan to halt and reverse nature and bioersity loss. How will they promote regenerative agricultural practices  How will they create more spaces for nature  How will they prevent the decline — and potential extinction — of our valuable species and wildle There are also three sectors in Northern Ireland which could be uniquely affected by the climate crisis: agriculture, energy and transport. These three sectors are vastly dferent. However, what unies questions regarding the future of these sectors is the principle of ‘just transition’.‘Just transition’ is the idea that we should not moveto a low-carbon, environmentally-friendly economyit means sacricing justice or ‘fairness’. A just transition recognises that, whether it be people on low incomes or workers in the fossil fuel industry, no one should be left behind in the creation of a ‘greener’ society.To take energy as an example, fossil fuels like oil and gas remain the primary source of heat and power in Northern Ireland. We already know that fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, and they will not help us to reach climate targets. Beyond asking candidate about renewable energy systems, we must therefore go one step further.We need to ask candidates about how they will compensate for workers in polluting industries, who may find themselves without a job in a more sustainable world. What incentive schemes will they promote  How will they re-train or upskill iniduals  How will government invest in this The same is true for agricultural and transport sectors. Will there be grants or public goods for farmers who dedicate areas of land to rewilding or regenerative practices  Will there be further investment in public transport infrastructure, particularly in rural communities  How will government incentivise citizens to support ‘greener’ lestyle choices that are typically more expensive, like buying an electric car or fitting solar  at home Lastly, ask the candidate seeking your vote about what is important to you.Whether it be plastic pollution or food waste, this is an invaluable opportunity for you to ask the candidate about a specic topic that you care deeply about. This could be an ongoing problem in your local area, or a global issue which causes you concern.Raising more personal questions with candidates may subsequently elicit a more direct response from them.Elections are a rare opportunity for citizens to shape environmental policy, and focus political attention on the most defining issue of our generation: the climate crisis.Climate change will be related to every social issue on each political party’s manesto – from gender equality to healthcare.Voting for candidates who support ambitious environmental policy solutions is therefore arguably the most important action that citizens can take.Remember this when candidates come calling.Related topicsEdwin PootsClare BaileyClimate ChangeClimate BillMore On Edwin Poots PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsStormont’s move towards first climate bill encouraging, says NI campaigner PremiumAndrew MaddenOpinionThe Weekly Political Spin: From climate change April fool#s and #winging it#, to anti-Nato rants and the crisis-that-isn#t-a-crisis PremiumEdwin Poots strongly tipped for South Belfast co-option PremiumCourt rules Sinn Fein member challenging DUP Minister Edwin Poots’ order to halt Irish Sea border checks to remain anonymousMost ReadIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospitalNorthern Ireland cop John Fleming facing jail over cruelty to pet dogs caught on dashcamNorthern Ireland completely unprepared for nuclear strike, warns Cold War bunker ownerUDA-linked drug enforcer and far-right thug to join Georgian Legion to fight RussiansRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerPlayWatch: Piano player lightens mood at Ukrainian refugee camp with #Somewhere Over the Rainbow# PlayVideo: Russian Army choir #abducted# while singing  Spectre theme songLatest EnvironmentEnvironment In Focus: Dromore Rugby Club plant trees to neutralise  miles of travelling for away gamesClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsThe -year-old nun that’s standing with our youth to help fight climate changeAsk the expert: ‘We need all of us to understand that this really is an emergency’Stormont’s move towards first climate bill encouraging, says NI campaignerLatestAverage price of petrol above £. per litre for first timeSqueeze on households could tighten as gas prices soar % to record highUkrainian volunteer troops marry in military fatigues at Kyiv checkpointMoscow condemned over ‘humanitarian corridors’ taking Ukrainians towards RussiaPost-mortem shows Shane Warne died of natural causes – Thai police,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

Restoration of St Patrickrsquos Cross and the interpretation  were financially supported.Exhibitions have benefited from the Friendsrsquo support in recent years with a major contribution to the extension at the back of the site was signicant. This included paintings for the new Tea Room.Talks and lecture series have been organised both in in the museum and at other venues with all profits given to the Friends.And dozens more: from the purchase of trees and shrubs for the garden at the back of the site to the purchase of a Papal bull..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Aontú selects human rights activist to run in Assembly election  ","story":"AONTUacute is fielding a candidate in South Down in the May Assembly election.The party has confirmed that Rosemary McGlone will be its standard bearer when voters go to the polls in  weeksrsquo time to elect five MLAs to represent the constituency.Aontuacute says it views South Down as a key constituency and aims to challenge the Stormont ldquoestablishment parties and provide genuine opposition to the to the broken Stormont system.A nationalist and human rights activist, Ms McGlone is a secondary school teacher in Belfast and a mother of four young children.Her party says that like many nationalists, she felt no longer represented by Sinn Fein or the SDLP and that rather than let herself be disenfranchised with no one to vote for, she has taken a step forward so that people like her might have a voice in Stormont.Aontuacute says that like so many, Rosemary has been ldquofrustrated by Nationalist parties who have abandoned their communities and supported discriminatory policies.It says the final straw for the South Down candidate came when Sinn Feacutein and SDLP MLAs voted for abortion up until birth for children with disabilities. Aontuacute says Rosemary also opposes the de-prioritisation funding of hundreds of local schools that is contained in the Integrated Education Bill.Her party leader, Peader Toacuteibiacuten, said , people are on housing waiting lists, , on hospital waiting lists for longer than a year, a quarter of a million people are in poverty and Sinn Fein and SDLP MLAs have voted for abortion right up until the birth of the child.He declared: ldquoThat the DUP has torn down Stormont in the middle of these very real human crisis is wrong and it must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoAontuacute is the only political party calling for the reform of the democratic institutions to prevent any one party tearing them down again or any one party preventing an Executive being formed in the future.ldquoThese le and death issues are too important for Stormont to be crashed over and over again. We are also calling for the suspension of MLA salaries for the political parties who crash the democratic institutions or prevent Executives being formed.Mr Aontuacute described Ms McGlone as a le-long human rights activist and nationalist who stopped voting for the SDLP because ldquoit abandoned her and so many communities to pursue identity politics.He continued: ldquoRosemary will lead the fight to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people who currently have no representation in Co Down. Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill. All students mdash Catholic, Protestant and Integrated mdash should be treated equally. A vote for Rosemary is a vote for compassion and a vote to fix the broken system..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch lose out to UCD side  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH blew their chance to draw UCD into the relegation dogfight with a poor first half display into the wind on Saturday.There had been high hopes of a victory with a sizeable UCD contingent involved in the Ireland U- squad and the release of Ulsterrsquos Tom Stewart and Comac Izuchukwu to bolster the pack.However, the late withdrawal of the vastly experienced John Donnan meant a reshuffle with Tom Martin stepping in at lock and debutant Kyle Gill up to the bench.Playing into a gale in the first half, Ballynahinch failed to keep possession of the ball for long enough to exert any control on proceedings and were soon behind to a couple of excellently struck Chris Cosgrave penalties.The home side were denied a certain try when Stewart broke up the blindside and offloaded to a flying Conor McAuley but his foot was judged to be in touch.This proved to be signicant moment in the match as UCD scored a close range try from centre Dave Ryan soon afterwards to lead by  points with half an hour gone.Disaster was to strike for the home side on the stroke of half time when Ballynahinch found themselves pinned back from what should have been a comfortable position in the UCD half.They gave away a scrum penalty to concede territory but excellent defence forced a UCD knock-on and regained possession.Instead of playing narrow channels and reaching half-time no further in arrears, they were turned over in the middle of the field, allowing UCD to play an excellent kick behind a scrambling defence which then had to concede a goal lineout into a mph wind.The kick went straight out, handing the students a five-metre attacking scrum, and several phases later winger Ross Deegan scored. The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy.

The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

It is a book that every Christian should read especially those who are full time in the Lord’s service. As Bonar’s inspirational ‘Banner of Truth’ publication states on the dust cover of the  edition: “His diary and le is one of the great treasures left to the Church from the th century, and deserves to be widely and eagerly read”.On April , , Andrew Bonar made this entry: “Spared to see my th year, while others are taken”. The reason that he wrote those words was because so many of his friends and family had been taken away in death while they were still very young.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Just consider the following examples: three of his siblings died in infancy his father died when Andrew was just eleven his own son also called Andrew died as a young child his dear we Isabella passed away in middle age, and his very good Scottish ministerial friend the Rev Robert Murray McCheyne had died before he reached his thirtieth birthday, a fact that Bolnar reflected upon regularly for many subsequent years.As Bonar thought of the lives of others coming to an end so swtly, he pondered carefully and seriously the question - “Why am I spared  What is the reason that I am not taken away ” The diary reveals that he meditated upon that question on more than one occasion. It is a question that I have been caused to consider earnestly myself in recent days and you would be wise to consider it also. Ask yourself just now: “Why am I spared and others taken ” Why has God allowed you to live so long – when he has taken away some of your friends and loved ones in the prime of le  If you are a believer then there is only one answer to that question. The Lord has kept you alive , not so that you can make more money or make a name for yourself, but because your work for Him is not yet finished.There is still a work for you to do for Christ. The first time American acclaimed evangelist D. L. Moody met fellow US evangelist R. A. Torrey he said to him: “Young man you had better get to work for the Lord”. That is still the Lord’s message for you today. He would say: “Go work today in my vineyard’” . Get busy for the Lord while you still have the opportunity.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Alliance Party leader, Naomi Long. Picture by Philip Magowan   PressEye“The things that are pressing on people’s minds, our health service, on the cost-of-living crisis, the fact that we have to deal with climate change – these are the issues that are gripping people, not the constitutional question right now,” she told BBC NI’s ‘Sunday Politics’ show.“And when we take a position, as undoubtedly will happen at some point in the future, it will be based on facts and evidence.“We’re not going to see a referendum and we don’t want to support a referendum on Northern Ireland’s future in the context of, for example, a Brexit-style referendum where you promise everything to everybody, and everybody comes away disappointed.“So, we’ve got to actually focus on the things that matter to people and I think what we’ve got to do also is respect the fact that for many people in our community, and for a growing number, it isn’t the thing that defines their politics, and we’ve got to adapt our politics to respect that.”In her conference speech on Saturday, Mrs Long said a big result for the Alliance Party in the Assembly election in May could herald the end of Stormont political system based on binary ision.She stressed the need for major changes to structures that are currently based on the community designation system that effectively hands blocs of unionists or nationalists a veto.Yesterday, Mrs Long said Stormont could no longer one party was able to halt effective governanceit decided to “take their ball and go home”.Her comments come amid the latest power-sharing crisis at Stormont.The Executive imploded last month when the DUP withdrew first minister Paul Givan from the administration as part of its campaign of protest against Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.The move automatically ousted Sinn Fein deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill from office and removed the Executive’s ability to take any signicant decisions.Other ministers, such as Mrs Long, remain in post but are constrained in their ability to shape major policies.There remains uncertainty whether a new administration can be formed on the other side of the May  election, with the DUP making clear it cannot be business as usual until Brexit barriers on Irish Sea trade are removed.“We need to make sure that in future Assemblies and Executives that no party can take their ball and go home, and leave the rest of us in this kind of situation,” Mrs Long told BBC NI yesterday.“I think what we do need to do is rebalance the playing field. If the DUP don’t want to be part of government, they have a right to be, butthey don’t want to be that shouldn’t mean we can’t have a government, and the same should go for every other party.“If parties want to walk away from government, that’s their choice, which they should answer for, but they shouldn’t be able to hold the rest of us hostage.”Naomi LongNorthern IrelandDUPBrexitBBC  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularPSNI issue update on suspected abduction of young maleFermanagh GAA player’s family hit by third tragedy as father dies after being hit by lorryPSNI arrest man after reports of woman in distress‘Major rally’ details announced as unionists voice regret at Sinn Fein anonymity rulingChurches: Christianity in Ukraine is noted for its strength and resolutionMost PopularBest men’s waterproof hiking jacket UK : dry walking jackets from Rab, Columbia, Berghaus, Arc’TeryxBest portable solar chargers for camping UK : keep your USB devices charged while backpacking and campingBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, AcaiBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, these pans will produce perfect pancakes every timeBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from birth to , including Maxi Cosi, Halfords, Cybex                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported exclusively on our sister site The National on St Davids Day, the Cardf Capital Regiongroup of local authorities has bought the site of Wales last coal-fired power station for £ million. CCR says it is committing £. million to the project in total, which includes the purchase price.The other £. million will be spent on \"demolition, remediation, and re-development\".The contracts have now been exchanged between Cardf Capital Region and energy giant RWE, the seller. The distinctive Aberthaw Power Station as seen from the air. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The Cardf Capital Region have released a proposed \"master plan\" for the redevelopment of the site, which they say \"will take several years to come to fruition given the nature of and complexities involved in the transitioning process\".In sum, CCR says it will:Support the production of renewable and green energy projectsProvide an accompanying battery storage facility to support the green energy projectsProduce a zero-carbon manufacturing cluster which will include green hydrogen production facilitiesProvide a green energy innovation centre to promote innovation, growth, knowledge and community interaction with the zero-carbon future of WalesBe responsible for the development and maintenance of a bio-erse ecology park which will include a visitor centre, providing amenities to the local communityCreate the correct conditions to support industrial de-carbonisation and future giga-plant facilities.Cardf Capital Region also says the project has \"the potential to create thousands of direct, indirect and induced jobs, along with local supply chain and upskilling benefits\", though no further details were supplied as to what that means in practical terms. An artists impression of the Aberthaw Power Station site created by London real estate giant, Reef Group for Cardf Capital Region The master plan of the site produced by London real estate giant Reef Group on behalf of Cardf Capital Region The CCR goes on to say that it will \"maintain a strong commitment to engage and involve local community stakeholders in order to develop an open, inclusive and participative ethos as soon as the commercially sensitive considerations have been addressed.\"There are areas of the site which require ongoing custodianship, in respect of nature, bioersity and managing the overall ecology of the site, which will be best achieved in partnership with community.\"The Aberthaw nature reserve. The lagoon is where the ancient Aberthaw harbour was situated before it was destroyed to make way for the power station. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The group also says that its redevelopment plan will \"commit to safeguarding and developing the Nature Reserve, working with colleagues in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to ensure effective plans are put in place. In the interim, whilst plans are worked through, commitment is given to ensure this ecologically valuable component of the site is protected and, wherever possible, further enhanced and augmented\".However, Cardf Capital Region, despite promising to work with local residents in the future, stops short of making specic reference to concerns raised by members of the nearby community recently. Those concerns centre around what will happen to the  metre high pulverised ash mound, the sea wall being breached by the tide, and problems with traffic due to poor local transport infrastructure. The long Aberthaw Power Station ash mound, m high. The smoke stack can be seen in the background. Photo: Siriol Grfiths \"Well believe these plans when we see them,\" Paul Turner told The National. He has been living in the shadow of the power station since  and says that since then, he and his we Sara have seen many ideas come and go, including nuclear power and tidal energy. \"Everybody who lives near that site knows how toxic it is. The ash tip is full of asbestos from when they demolished the original A power station. And the site gets flooded whenever theres a spring tide or a storm, ask anyone who has worked there. Thatll only get worse as the years go by.\"Will £ million keep the tide from drowning that site  Id say RWE are laughing all the way to the bank.\"The Climate Central Coastal Risk Screening Tool predicts that the site will be under water by , with flooding reaching as far inland as St Hilarys There are similar concerns from Barry Town Councillor, Dennis Clarke: \"The ambition for the Vale to access clean, green, high value employment is commendable but this site could not be sold to private industry. The likely reason the site was regarded as unsaleable might be the cost of dealing with tidal flooding, clearing the signicant level of contamination, removing the slag heap, identied as dangerous by RWE.\"Its well known that the road access is completely insufficient, especially bearing in mind the Vale and the Welsh Government persist in supporting a too large, unviable development at Model Farm\"I hope the CCR releases the papers that will show why they believe this site is suitable for any development beyond reinstating what was in place before the power station was built.\"A map produced by London real estate giant Reef Group in  depicting so-called major assets nearbyIn its statement, the CCR describes the Aberthaw site as having \"strong strategic links with other major assets, including Bro Tathan Business Park, Cardf Airport, and the overarching St Athan Enterprise Zone – one of the few sites in the UK capable of accommodating large-scale lithium-ion battery production\".Last month, the Welsh Government was accused of having let a proposed gigafactory project at St Athan \"slip throughfingers\" by Welsh Conservative South Wales Central MS Andrew RT Davies. It followed an announcement by car battery manufacturer, Britishvolt, that it was creating a factory in Northumberland, whereas St Athan had been its original preferred location. March  : Aberthaw Power Station as photographed from the Wales Coast Path. The site is currently badly flooded in the wake of recent storms and spring tides. Photo: Siriol Grfiths CCRs plans make no specic reference to tidal energy at Aberthaw either, despite the group having earmarked the site as being \"perfect for that type of facility\" last summer. By October , it was also reported that a new commission was being set up to explore building a barrage across the Severn estuary for tidal energy CCR is a part of that commission. However, a statement supplied by Welsh Government Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething, does moot the possibility of tidal energy: \"The proposed plan for Aberthaw is positive news which fits well with our commitment to develop tidal lagoon projects and support ideas that can help Wales become a world centre for emerging tidal technologies\".Mr Gethings enthusiasm is echoed by the UK governments Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, who is the Conservative MP for Monmouth: \"The UK Government’s investment in the Cardf Capital Region will deliver thousands of jobs at Aberthaw and help put Wales on course for an economic recovery from the pandemic.\"The current s of the Cardf Capital Region - including any activity at Aberthaw - will eventually move into the new South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee .Three other Corporate Joint Committees will cover the rest of Wales in the south-west, the north, and the central area of the country.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can’t wait to hear what the children think of it.“This new school building will provide a modern teaching and learning environment for staff and pupils, as well as a range of facilities for the local community.”The design includes solar  with battery storage, an air source heat pump, electric vehicle charging points, storage space for bicycles and scooters, and green habitat areas.Contractors ISG began building the school in January last year, which forms part of the council’s wider £ million programme of new school buildings across the Vale.Cllr Burnett added: “The council has made a climate commitment through our Project Zero initiative, which aims to make the organisation carbon neutral by . Delivering schools like this, which are extremely environmentally friendly, is a key part of that pledge.“This is the latest project in our Sustainable Communities for Learning programme, a far-reaching body of work intended to transform educational facilities across the Vale.”Protests were sparked by the decision to relocate Llancarfan Primary School from its village setting five miles down the road to Rhoose, with some parents opposing what they saw as the closure of a rural school. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFlammable cladding was found on Lydstep Flats in Llandaff North in March , following concerns about fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.Cardf council removed the cladding in December later that year, leaving residents suffering from cold flats, poor insulation and black mould.Now contractors ISG have started to replace that cladding, with the work expected to last until summer next year.Councillor Lynda Thorne, cabinet member for housing and communities, said: “I’m so glad, as I know all the Lydstep residents are, that contractors are now on site to begin replacing the cladding that was removed because it didn’t meet current fire safety standards.“The cladding we’re using to overclad the three blocks is of the highest level of fire safety.”The work includes new windows and upgrading balconies for the  flats. Meanwhile, residents in council flats in Butetown are still waiting for contractors to begin installing replacement cladding, with no start date announced yet.Flats at Loudon House and Nelson House in Butetown were also found to have flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell fire.Delays to both the council flats in Llandaff North and Butetown were due to inflation caused by Brexit and the pandemic, according to the council, as well as changes to the safety testing rules for new cladding. The estimated cost of replacing cladding at Lydstep doubled from £. million to £ million.Cllr Thorne added: “Progress on this work has been affected by signicant cost rises due to Brexit and inflationary pressures in the building industry, as well as the impact of the extensive testing and regulation framework for cladding solutions.“Throughout this time, we have been so grateful to the residents for their patience as we worked on finding the right solution for the three blocks, and it’s great to see contractors on site and work underway.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe app would let users know real-time data on public transport and the road network, and the estimated time to get somewhere by car, train, bus or bike.A huge upgrade in traffic monitoring, new bus lanes, and a state-of-the-art new traffic control room also form part of Cardf council’s plans for an ‘intelligent transport system’.Buses could also be ordered like taxis, taking a route based on the demand for the service determined by public requests.The council will consult the public on its plans to roll out the changes for the system, which it hopes will encourage people to walk, cycle or take public transport.Cllr Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: “We want to ask the public their views on our draft strategy to build an intelligent transport system in Cardf. We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
