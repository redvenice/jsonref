And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Then a voice echoed around the west London housing estate: “We are passing through the valley of the shadow of death, but we are not alone.” It was Sunday 19 April, when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its most intense in London and the earth was shifting beneath our feet.The Rev Pat Allerton, a Church of England vicar, pressed a button on his phone to play Judy Collins’ powerful rendition of Amazing Grace, and something extraordinary happened.Faces appeared behind glass, windows opened and people leaned out. Residents came on to balconies. Some held up small children to see. A woman aided by a walking frame shuffled on to a path. A couple of older men in vests stood with their arms crossed women in hijabs came out of their homes a man wearing a kippah stopped to listen.Amazing Grace faded and Allerton took up his microphone. As he began the Lord’s Prayer, some people bowed their heads, some put their hands together, some mouthed words taught many years before. A few wept. No one laughed or jeered or heckled. In the middle of one of the most cosmopolitan cities on earth, this was a communal moment of spirituality.A month earlier, the Church of England had suspended services and locked its church doors. Mosques cancelled Friday prayers, temples closed, synagogues shut. At a critical moment when people were frightened, uncertain and in desperate need of comfort and hope, congregational prayer and worship, the cornerstone of organised religion, was no longer. Faith leaders were forced to find new ways of reaching out.Allerton decided that if people were unable to go to church, he would take church to the people. He rented a cargo bike, borrowed a sound system and bought a portable generator online. He was uncertain how people would react to his bite-sized services on the streets, in estates and outside hospitals. But he said: “I’ve been amazed by the response. People feel very emotional. They are looking for answers.” The crisis had shown a “spiritual hunger out there”, he added.Five million people tuned in to a service led by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, at a makeshift altar on his kitchen table on 22 March, broadcast on the BBC and Facebook. The C of E, which has seen a steep decline in churchgoing in recent decades, said it was the largest single “congregation” in its history.Clergy at St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square were astonished to find more than 1,000 people joining their online morning prayer sessions. At St Nics in Durham, more than 2,300 people watched a streamed service one Sunday in March, compared with a normal attendance of about 300.The Church of England launched a 24-hour free phone line for Christian worship and prayer, aimed at people with no or limited access to the internet and offering “words of comfort and hope”. More than 6,000 calls were made in the first 48 hours of operation.Other faiths and denominations saw similar trends. Anglicans, Pentecostals, Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Hindus and others rapidly developed or expanded online prayers and services. Remarkably, the transfer of faith to the easily accessible and informal virtual world unleashed a new experimentation.“People who might be curious but perhaps inhibited by unfamiliar dress codes or arcane rituals discovered they could try out faith anonymously, log in to different services, even cross religions,” said Ed Kessler, founder director of the interfaith Woolf Institute. “You might think: I wonder what happens at Muslim prayers – now you can find out.” Rather like a pub crawl, people could do a “place of worship crawl”.As religious leaders learned to master the mute button, some sought more creative ways to keep the faith.In Stamford Hill in north London, Europe’s biggest ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, the closure of synagogues and the government’s edict to maintain physical distance from people outside one’s household were grievous blows.Two weeks before lockdown began, Jews celebrated the festival of Purim with prayer services and parties, where dancing, singing and embracing almost certainly spread the virus. Two weeks after the start of lockdown, as the Jewish death toll from Covid-19 was rising at an alarming rate, Passover – traditionally another time of communal worship and family feasts – was marked in isolation.For many Jews, the directive from faith leaders to pray at home or online was not simple. Many ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews have limited access to the internet, and the use of technology is prohibited on Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath. Moreover, a minyan – a physical quorum of 10 males over the age of 13 – is required for prayer. How could they meet both the requirements of their faith and the coronavirus constraints?Joel Snitzer had an idea. The owner of a construction company and the father of 10 children, Snitzer went to the synagogue to pray three times a day before lockdown. Now the synagogue was locked, but perhaps he and his neighbours could form a minyan, each separated in their own back garden.Over a weekend, he built a bimah, a raised platform from which the Torah is read, where his garden meets the garden backing it. He fetched the Torah scroll from his synagogue. The neighbours agreed on a daily act of worship at 9.45am. To all intents and purposes, they created a backyard synagogue.“We’re fortunate to have so many of us living in adjacent properties,” he said one morning in early May. “Jews have had many challenges in our history, and we usually find a way of adapting – and this is what we’ve done now. People are thriving on it, especially the older generation who can’t leave their homes.”After attaching tefillin – small leather boxes containing handwritten parchments – to his forehead and bicep, winding the straps seven times around his forearm and hand, Snitzer adjusted his tallit, or prayer shawl, and climbed the steps to the bimah for their daily act of worship. In gardens and on flat roofs, his neighbours gathered with their prayer books.Not quite all the neighbours: the family living next door to the Snitzers are Muslim. Wass Bham had no problem with daily Jewish prayers. “I think it’s a good thing that people find a way to practice their religion and achieve a sense of community in a safe way at this time,” he said. “Muslims and Jews have a lot in common. And at the end of the day we are living side by side.”By then, Bham had been fasting during daylight hours for two weeks, with another two weeks still ahead of him. Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, was an unprecedented challenge this year, with people unable to go to the mosque to pray after sunset and prohibited from sharing their iftar meals to break the daily fast with loved ones.“This is something completely new for us,” said Mohammed Kozbar, the chairman of the Finsbury Park mosque, shortly before Ramadan began. “We would normally have about 2,000 people coming through the mosque every day – even those who don’t normally pray. Now the mosque is locked and empty. It’s heartbreaking.”The silver lining was the chance to spend more time with his family, he said. With the closure of mosques, Muslim men and women began praying at home together for the first time. It was “one of the small blessings we can see in this horrendous situation,” said Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra, a Leicester imam.The East London mosque, which serves the UK’s biggest Muslim community and usually has around 7,000 people in attendance on Fridays, decided – similarly to Allerton – that if people couldn’t come to the mosque for iftar, they would take iftar to the people. In partnership with the charity Supporting Humanity, throughout Ramadan they delivered hundreds of meals to Muslim and non-Muslim staff at the Royal London hospital.One recipient, Boshura Khatan, a respiratory and cardiac nurse, said the hospital felt like “a war zone” when Ramadan began. She had prioritised her patients over her prayers on many evenings and had often gone home with a “banging headache” after a 12-hour shift in full PPE and with no food or water. Ayesha Khan, another nurse, also had not always found the time to pray. “I feel sad about it, but I also feel I’ve become closer to God through this crisis. My faith has definitely deepened.”For many people, the pandemic has led to a fundamental recalibration of the way we live and what is really important. In contemplating mortality, the question “is this it?” takes on weight and urgency. No wonder there has been some degree of religious revival – but how enduring it is remains to be seen.Now some faith leaders are asking themselves whether the changes in the way they have practiced their faith under lockdown will leave a lasting mark. In conversation with Kessler about the new religious landscape, Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, wondered whether time was up on the concept of religious institutions as “official brokers” between people and God. Joe Aldred, a Pentecostal bishop, said lockdown had “solidified my longstanding sense of wanting to understand God beyond the euphoria of what happens on a Sunday”. Isolation, he added, could “enrich the spiritual experience”.Faith leaders had adapted surprisingly quickly to new circumstances, said Kessler. “They have generated new communities, some of which will survive. But the institutionalisation of religion will be less important in the future. People might want certainty, but they don’t want rigidity.”Allerton had similar thoughts. Of his church congregation, he said: “Like any family, we miss each other and we long to be back together. But there’s been real learning about how to reach out and reconnect with the world. Our message stays the same, but its delivery needs to move with the times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ae895bb1906915e10abc0d27c066d52c619144/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c1d33eed8ae9034bc2dcc9f292af8c8","title":"i stuck my foot in the door what it is like to be black in uk publishing","story":"‘More African’ covers. Adding racist characters. As authors and industry insiders share their experiences, readers can see how the books they read are changed by white publishersPublishing is in the middle of a reckoning. In the weeks since the death of George Floyd, as black authors topped UK books charts for the first time, and #Publishingpaidme exposed the disparities in what black and white writers are paid, publishers – long criticised for employing overwhelmingly white workforces who cater for white readers – have been grappling with their record with black authors, editors and agents. And black people in publishing are not holding back, sharing details of the “hostile environment” they’ve been working in.Last week’s release of the Rethinking “Diversity” in Publishing report confirmed what many people already knew. With interviews with 100 authors, agents and publishing staff, it found that UK publishers still serve a supposed core audience of white, middle-aged, middle-class readers, a mission that changes books by black writers in ways that are invisible to a reader by the time they hold the book in their hands.Narratives that don’t fit a typically white, middle-class editor’s perception of black people result in rejections, changes and comments that far exceed constructive criticism. Malorie Blackman’s magical black siblings pitch was deemed implausible and rejected. Dorothy Koomson was asked to add racist characters and a slave narrative. Some authors have been asked to sign off on “a more African cover”, others prevented from showing any hint of blackness at all. Some books, such as Bernardine Evaristo’s Mr Loverman – about an older, black gay protagonist – have been “negatively” considered “niche”. (In Evaristo’s case, “triple niche”.)“Black writers do not want special consideration,” Koomson wrote recently. “We want a level playing field, the chance to write books and explore as many subjects and genres as our white counterparts.”Early in her career, literary agent Emma Paterson learned to “anticipate” these responses from publishers. Alongside pitch letters, she would send information editors wouldn’t know to inform them why there was “commercial or intellectual value” in books that speak “very directly to an audience that’s not white” – which were often “mainstream for black and brown readers”.Agents in the Rethinking “Diversity” report claimed that finding BAME authors remains a major challenge for them, citing a lack of submissions from BAME writers, or being unable to find them through the usual avenues: prizes and creative writing courses. But Paterson is sceptical. “I fiercely oppose the idea that it’s hard to find the writers because the writers are out there, clearly, you just need to look for them,” she says. “I think a lot of it is about … desire. What are your priorities? What do you want to find?”Paterson, whose client list at Aitken Alexander includes Evaristo, Paul Mendez and Otegha Uwagba, notes that although looking for black writers might require “engaging with different writing communities”, she also uses “exactly the same channels as everyone else”. She has discovered a number of her authors by simply sending them a message on social media: “That’s how I’ve built a list that doesn’t resemble lots of the lists of very established, powerful, older, white agents in the industry.”“There were things I understood, and so I didn’t have to ask him questions about the authenticity of what he was trying to say or how relatable it will be,” says Lovegrove, whose imprint is dedicated to authors “excluded from the mainstream”. Her anger with the UK publishing industry, she says, is due to what she calls “corporate colonialism”: “They came, built up and gentrified London, created jobs and hired everyone except those who are born there from black, Asian and marginalised ethnicities as well as people from working class, neuro-atypical backgrounds and excluding much of the LGBTQI+ communities, which together make up over half of the population of the capital. To redress the balance my aim is to be fully inclusive by paving the way – as is the heritage of all civil rights movements.”Perception isn’t the only hurdle numbers are too. As books by black authors are comparatively few, the industry method of predicting sales by comparing similar titles is problematic. “If there isn’t anything similar,” says Lovegrove, “then it’s really hard to position it in the market. So therefore you have to always start at a very low point, because it’s almost like everything is the original. Although the maths isn’t biased, the process in which black writers are compared is.”Queenie author and former marketing executive Candice Carty-Williams knew this well and positioned her debut about a single, millennial woman as the “black Bridget Jones”. Although the phrase raised a few eyebrows, Carty-Williams knew it would work in her favour: “That was me sticking my foot in the door and pitching it alongside this book that was a huge commercial success so people knew how it should be treated.”It worked. She signed a six-figure deal with Orion after a four-way auction Queenie has sold more than 77,000 copies and was recently named book of the year at the British Book Awards. The success of Queenie, says Kishani Widyaratna, a Sri Lankan commissioning editor at Picador who works with several black writers, proves publishers are misjudging their audiences: “There is a failure in really understanding what readers want to read ... these books are racing up the charts.”One of the most striking things about Queenie is the cover: the braided up-do, the large gold hoop earrings, the black woman. Many successful books have covers with black characters, but some publishers still fear that “strong racial signifiers” could make a book seem “niche”. One respondent in the Rethinking Diversity report said that putting black people on covers is still “seen as a bold move”. Some designers avoid this by “downplaying” racial elements, while others find safety in following trends: silhouettes of women with afro hair, or wearing headwraps, or using African prints. (Replacing the much derided acacia tree stereotype that was popular for years.)Patrice Lawrence knew she didn’t want the cover of Orangeboy – a family drama that touches on the issue of knife crime – to be a stereotype boys doing “a gun sign or something”. She praises her then editor Emma Goldhawk for commissioning a cover that reflected the essence of the book, as well as getting it into the hands of her intended audience. Lawrence notes that Goldhawk “had gone into schools”, submitted it for prizes and even passed on copies to her running club. Yet she feels that much of her positive experience was down to inidual effort, rather than being widespread.“The younger generation are quite global,” she says, referencing her daughter who enjoys anime and is starting a degree in anthropology and Japanese. “I think publishing doesn’t move quick enough and have enough of these types of young people inside publishing to enable them to connect with that.” Paterson however has seen a small change in the landscape. “It does look a little bit different,” she says. “You have a different generation who don’t really need to explain the value of a book or that there is an audience, because they kind of get it. They exist and operate in the same spaces.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/297c9d515a85994d764a67985dbfe414bd75888d/0_305_6600_3960/master/6600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3bd05d141579ead29e50ca37c93a46d2","title":"uk buys stake bankrupt oneweb satellite rival eu galileo system","story":"Investment with India made in US firm OneWeb after Brexit locks UK out of Europe’s satellite navigation systemThe UK government has pledged to invest $500m (£400m) in bankrupt satellite company OneWeb, giving it a stake in a business that provides broadband from space.The government, which has proven so far unwilling to take stakes in major British companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic, will receive a “significant equity share” in the loss-making company as it seeks to make “high-risk, high-payoff” investments of the kind advocated by 10 Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings.The deal, which is still subject to US court approval, is expected to close before the end of the year. It includes a pledge to bring manufacturing of OneWeb’s satellites to the UK, where it is headquartered.Indian telecoms company Bharti will also invest $500m, which will “bring OneWeb a revenue base to contribute towards its future success”, the government said on Friday. Much of India does not have access to high-speed internet.Downing Street said: “The deal will support the UK to be a pioneer in the research, development, manufacturing, and exploitation of novel satellite technologies, whilst boosting UK manufacturing.”The investment is backed by the Unite trade union, which represents many aerospace manufacturing workers, in the hope it will bring secure, high-skilled jobs for workers.However, some space experts have raised concerns over the suitability of its technology for navigational purposes. The government had ambitions to create its own rival to the US’s global positioning system (GPS), although it had reportedly scaled back those plans. The UK has been barred from the EU’s Galileo system because of Brexit.Dr Bleddyn Bowen, a space policy expert at the University of Leicester, told the  last week it was a “tech and business gamble” that the satellites could be redesigned to allow navigation. The existing major satellite navigational systems all use satellites orbiting about 20,000km from the Earth’s surface, compared with only 1,200km for low-Earth orbits.OneWeb’s network has been described as unsuitable for navigational purposes by the UK’s own space agency, according to internal documents cited by the Daily . A spokesman for the agency declined to comment on the documents.Graham Turnock, the UK Space Agency chief executive, said: “Now is the right time to look at new ways to use space to boost the UK’s prosperity, security and global influence, while benefitting people across the whole country.”The satellites were previously built in the US by Airbus, the European aerospace manufacturer, which was also an investor in OneWeb. OneWeb’s main competitor in low-Earth orbit satellites is Starlink, the satellite company run by the billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX.OneWeb was founded in 2012 by American businessman Greg Wyler with the aim of providing cheap internet access around the world through a network of hundreds of satellites. OneWeb had raised $3.4bn in equity and debt to fund its “constellation” of 74 satellites, with plans for a network of 650 covering the globe. However, it failed to secure new funding at the end of March from investors including its largest backer SoftBank, the big-spending conglomerate controlled by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son. OneWeb filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US at the end of March to try to find a buyer.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said: “This deal underlines the scale of Britain’s ambitions on the global stage.“Our access to a global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect millions of people worldwide to broadband, many for the first time, and the deal presents the opportunity to further develop our strong advanced manufacturing base right here in the UK.”The deal will give the UK a “sovereign global satellite system”, as well as “strategic opportunities across a wide range of other applications”, the government said.Sunil Bharti Mittal, the chairman of Bharti Enterprises, said the low-Earth orbit satellites were the “only viable mechanism through which the ‘last billion’ can be connected”, referring to the roughly 1 billion people in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and India who do not have internet access.The UK will have a final say over any future sale of the company, and over future access to OneWeb technology by other countries on national security grounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef40b54d52f8407640fdb149f7b94d02240117ae/88_0_5269_3161/master/5269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8d06bb4da88801e4d1e67a7ee01c8f","title":"cancellation activism persuasion cancel culture twitter","story":"While denouncing someone can get you high, it ignores human complexity, and is no substitute for the hard work of persuasionHow do you change someone’s mind?

It’s a human being.”When civilians, ordinary human beings, are cancelled, their lives are turned upside down. Jon Ronson has written perceptively about cancel culture’s sibling, public shaming. An ill-advised tweet may make someone unemployable, the consequences lingering for years.I write this as someone who I know some would like cancelled because I continue to think biological sex exists – which in certain circles is heresy. It’s true I have this platform, and cancel culture can be a way for the powerless to bring down the powerful.Lately, however, I see it as just another power tool of misogyny, and I cannot stand by and watch as more women are basically thrown onto the pyre while twitchy mobs ready the torches. JK Rowling imagined worlds that enchanted many, then dared to tell us some real stuff that happened to her. Actors with their eyes on the prize denounced her. Out went any imagination in came the witch-finder general. Those who had encouraged the mob then had to backtrack when the man who abused her appeared on the front page of the Sun. They had, it seemed, wanted to burn her at the stake – but didn’t really like the smell of the flames.Now we have Damian Barr making sure Emma Nicholson, who held an honorary position on the Booker Prize Committee, is booted off for her views on same sex marriage and some terrible tweets about trans people. Gay authors have won the prize, but Barr said she would have the ring off his finger. Really? Some of us are not fans of marriage full stop, but I digress.This becomes yet another argument where to disagree with someone is said to erase them. This is not a dialogue. It is a showy monologue of purity, always bound to unravel. It is possible that Nicholson is a homophobe who has also done some good in the world: rescuing Romanian orphans starting a charity in 1991 called AMAR in response to Saddam Hussein’s systematic persecution of Marsh Arabs campaigning for many years for the Yazidis, who continue to suffer terribly. Can a person do good things and think wrong things ? How do we evolve if this cannot be acknowledged?As it turns out, Barr himself wrote some nasty tweets about the attempted suicide of a trans woman. I don’t want him cancelled. I don’t want Nicholson cancelled. None of this is activism, which is daily work, often boring and inevitably involves compromise. This is just backslapping performance, and it disturbs me to see how its targets are now regularly women – such as Allison Bailey and her case against Stonewall.David Willetts, who is also no great shakes on gay rights and is on the Booker committee, was not targeted by Barr. Why not?Clicktivism, especially when it involves cancelling, is a psychological method of bonding offering status and a veneer of solidarity with no real cost. If you don’t take your target down, another woman doing wrongthink will soon pop up.If cancelling doesn’t work, it is because the people targeted are being protected by something more evil than can ever be imagined (yes, I have read this about myself), rather than the mundane truth that people may think differently from each other. Difference is not hate. We contain multitudes, we make mistakes, we grow. “I got some bad ideas in my head,” said Travis Bickle. Well, don’t we all?If identity politics is the new theatre of war, let’s stop the performance of a pre-formed, perfect set of beliefs and discuss how we engage each other politically. Cancelling is short-lived as a high. You are better off with poppers. It’s a zero-sum game. Because in the end we are all potentially cancellable – but you can’t cancel my right to think."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df085977408145c429d140b81534d04921ae1d8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=613d3f9e0b1d9cf8438d564863b7b8f0","title":"leicester coronavirus lockdown is no surprise to its garment factory workers","story":"Our new report on the industry has revealed lockdown breaches, furlough fraud and conditions of modern slaveryAs the UK’s first local coronavirus lockdown was imposed in Leicester earlier this week, another shocking story joined it in the headlines. The report we compiled at Labour Behind the Label told a stark tale: of lockdown breaches, furlough fraud and conditions of modern slavery in Leicester’s garment factories. After failing to heed warnings to properly monitor conditions there, Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has finally been forced to say he will investigate.At one factory employing over 80 people there have been around 15 Covid-19 cases, including the supervisor. When one worker applied for statutory sick pay, his boss told him that he would not receive it and ordered him to keep working through the illness. Some workers said they were told to continue working despite testing positive for coronavirus, and were warned not to tell anyone. Others disclosed to their bosses that relatives in the same household were ill with coronavirus, but were ordered to keep working, going against government guidance to isolate.These exploitative conditions are appalling, and yet to place the blame entirely on factory owners would give the companies profiting from the exploitation a free pass – and fail to tackle the root of the issue.Complex and secretive supply chains make it hard to enforce regulations and monitor labour practices. The fast fashion model used by Boohoo is characterised by small-batch orders with a fast turnaround. This model encourages subcontracting in order to meet low prices and quick production times. Labour Behind the Label has long campaigned for Boohoo to take the first step in improving labour rights in their supply chain by increasing transparency, and this illustrates why.Although the Covid-19 crisis has caused grim new problems for Leicester’s garment workers, the exploitation detailed in the report is not new. Concerns about working conditions and illegally low pay in Leicester’s factories have been subject to press investigations, and even the focus of government reports. Yet there has been little meaningful action to tackle these issues, or the social and economic inequalities that allow exploitation and poor business practices to take place.Most garment workers in Leicester’s factories are from ethnic minority backgrounds. Around a third of workers were born outside the UK. Migration status, language barriers and higher levels of unemployment push workers to accept poor working conditions and illegally low pay, having little other option. Meanwhile the government’s hostile environment policy has taken the form of immigration raids in Leicester’s garment industry, rather than rooting out illegal work practices and the poor purchasing practices that drive them. Vulnerable migrant workers fear speaking out against exploitative employers in case their migration status is weaponised against them.The Covid-19 crisis has laid bare the inequalities in the garment industry. We need far greater transparency in our supply chains, and governments and clothing brands alike must commit to due diligence to protect human rights in the industry.For many years, citizens have been reduced to consumers. We are told that our power lies in the personal choices we make about where we spend our money. But this puts responsibility on iniduals, rather than the brands and governments who allow this exploitation to take place. We need to harness much more than just our consumer powers, and demand change more vocally. Sign petitions, join campaigns and write to brands demanding that they do better by their workers – let’s make this a moment of change.• Meg Lewis is campaigns manager at Labour Behind the Label, a group that works to improve conditions and empower workers in the global garment industry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0faa2138d7c90c803c36ae11d18beefe87a99fe/0_140_5568_3342/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cd85fa2e21d51841cae352b8b84a7ef0","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from parents and teachers about the government’s announcement that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full at the start of the next academic yearThe government have today announced that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full in September.Current limitations on the number of students that can be in school at once will be lifted, but schools will be expected to keep children in ‘bubbles’ according to their class or year group.

An initial 100 scooters are set to appear in Middlesbrough later this month in a partnership with a new UK-based operator, Ginger, rolling out across Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool.Allowed to go no faster than 15.5mph, the scooters can be ridden on the road or in bike lanes but not on the pavement. Helmets are recommended but not compulsory. It is likely to cost about £1 to unlock a scooter using an app, with riders charged between 15p and 25p per minute extra per ride.Users will need a full or provisional car, motorcycle or moped licence to take part in the trials, and must be 16 or over. Though e-scooters are already available to buy online and in many bike shops, only rented bikes will be legal under the law that applies in England, Scotland and Wales.How this distinction will be policed is not yet clear, admits Portsmouth councillor Lynne Stagg, who is part of a committee that has agreed to introduce a rental scheme across the Solent region of Hampshire, Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight this summer.“I’m all for e-scooters as long as they are legal. We have been liaising with the police over how to crack down on the illegal ones. I’ve seen people already riding like absolute lunatics,” she said.She hopes e-scooters can be part of a green economic recovery, improving air quality and reducing congestion. “The average number of cars per household in Portsmouth is 1.6. My hope is that e-scooters will encourage households to get rid of their second car,” she said.Rental companies already operating in mainland Europe are competing with startups such as Ginger in a race to woo local authorities, insisting they will bear the costs – and risks – of pilot schemes. “We’ve already been contacted by 20, perhaps 25 different firms,” said Stagg.Despite a few high-profile accidents – last year the Youtuber and TV presenter Emily Hartridge died riding an e-scooter in London – research from the International Transport Federation found that a trip by car or by motorcycle in a dense urban area is much more likely to result in a death than a trip by a e-scooter.Councils can stipulate how their pilot schemes operate. In Portsmouth and the Tees Valley, users will be fined for riding outside of the operation zone and have to dock their bikes in designated parking spaces.Other areas may take a more relaxed approach, allowing riders to park up wherever they like. Some may consider that naive, given the experience of the first generation of “dockless” bike hire schemes, such as Mobike, much of whose fleet was vandalised or dumped in canals after launching in Manchester in 2017.Tier scooters weigh 27kg, making it more difficult – but not impossible – to throw in a canal. Most rental models include GPS tracking and software that allow operators to designate no-go zones.In London, the US-owned operator Bird has run a rental scheme in the privately owned Olympic Park since November 2018. According to spokesman Harry Porter, Bird can programme the scooters to drop their speed in certain areas. “So when they approach a playground, for example, the maximum speed drops to 5mph until you’ve gone 50 yards beyond it,” said Porter.Only one scooter has gone missing in 18 months, he insisted: “If we see that a scooter has left the zone we just turn the motor off so that it is no fun to ride and all someone has cluttering up their hallway is a useless, massive paperweight.”Many conflicts lie ahead, not least with blind people, who argue they are most likely to be mowed down by e-scooters.“If there is strong uptake – and looking elsewhere in the world where they are being used it’s likely there will be – then they will add to the case for bike lanes which would be good,” said Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cyclist turned Greater Manchester walking and cycling commissioner.“Longer term they may also see people progress to bikes for greater speed, range and health so the potential to be a positive travel disruptor is high. However, there are a lot of hurdles that need to be addressed, such as the potential conflict with pedestrians and the need for smooth roads to stay safe, so I’ll be fascinated to see how the trial goes.”The UK government says e-scooters can have motors with a maximum continuous power rating of 500W. The Xiaomi’s is 300W and a fully charged battery will propel you up to 28 miles at a maximum speed of 15mph. To get going, you have to do a few manual scoots and then press a little lever on the handlebars before – whoosh! – you’re off. Even just over 12mph feels naughtily fast, so I keep my left hand permanently hovering over the brake as I whizz through Stockport’s suburbia.In my spare time I campaign to get more people walking and cycling where I live. The hills have always been a stumbling block to the cause but e-bikes and scooters feel like a realistic alternative to car commuting for those normal people who don’t perspire for fun. The Xiaomi survives the ascent of Werneth Low, chivvied along with a few human scoots. Going downhill is the hairy part, particularly when I hit an enormous pothole.My trip is, strictly speaking, illegal. From Saturday, only rented e-scooters will be allowed on the roads. But Pure Electric is hoping to offer long-term loans to customers to keep the government happy. I’m certainly smiling after my illicit test drive – and am not even vaguely sweaty for once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/764e98d23b6d148d72a53036abbd72153c732a63/214_470_2097_1258/master/2097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0ba56d6e65201bfac4e4d5e45348478","title":"swans ospreys one womans soaring migration mission aoe","story":"Conservationist Sacha Dench will also log marine mammals she sees from her paramotor on the 7,000km journey across Europe and AfricaSacha Dench is not one to sit still. Known to many as “the human swan” for her record-breaking journey tracking migrating swans in a motorised paraglider, the conservationist and adventurer is planning her next aerial mission: to follow ospreys migrating 7,000km across Europe and Africa.“It’s really hard to get people to care about migratory species because they are not the responsibility of any one country,” says Dench, who founded Conservation Without Borders and was named as a UN ambassador for migratory species this year. “Birds often don’t fit within borders so they don’t sit in national action plans unless they breed there. But we need to think of conservation in terms of a species’ entire flyway or migratory track.”It was in 2016 that Dench undertook the Flight of the Swans, flying 7,000km across 11 countries in a paramotor to track the migrating Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) across the tundra in the Russian Arctic to the UK.Next year, as part of her three-year strategy as UN ambassador, she will take to the skies once again to follow ospreys migrating 7,000km across Europe and Africa. Every August, these birds of prey fly from their breeding grounds in Scotland, south to the Strait of Gibraltar and across the Sahara to Senegal, Guinea-Bissau and Ghana in west Africa, where they spend the winter.In preparation for the four-month Flight of the Osprey expedition, Dench is speaking to British ambassadors in every country along the route. With help from scientists at Cardiff University, she is developing a protocol for aerial photo surveys of macroplastics, and will log manatees, humpback whales and other marine mammals she sees from her paramotor. As she flies, her motor turned off as much as possible as she catches thermals as ospreys do, her support team on the ground will sample water quality and test for pollutants, pesticides and microplastics, and assess the state of seagrass – an important habitat for the fish ospreys eat and also a great carbon store.\u0026nbspDench first took to the air in a paraglider in a quest to conquer her “debilitating” fear of flying after a frightening experience in a small plane. “It’s such simple technology and I could feel every single movement, so I felt very connected to the air. I could catch thermals like a bird. Learning to fly was an intense experience.” Then she saw someone put a motor on their back and realised that she could “take off anywhere and do anything. So, now I have an aircraft in the back of my car.”\u0026nbspWhen she discovered the paramotor, Dench, a biologist, was working for Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT). She started using it to take aerial photos as a way of assessing habitats. “Wetlands make so much more sense from the air because it’s possible to see how they connect and how they change with the tides – these photos helped to put wetlands on the map,” she says.\u0026nbspWWT scientists, who X-ray birds on their return to UK wetlands, had found that, for the past 30 years, one in three Bewick’s swans had shot in their bodies. “But the declining swan population was difficult to solve. The number of different problems in each of the 11 countries they fly through can be overwhelming,” says Dench, who kept looking at the map, imagining what their gruelling journeys might involve. “I wanted to bring that to life while engaging with key players, from hunting associations to power companies, and inspiring communities to help.”As she followed the journey of eight GPS-tagged swans, Dench endured extreme cold and challenging flying conditions. But she remembers a particular highlight.“There was one magical moment when two swans flew alongside at my right wingtip, surfing on the big vortex,” says Dench, who holds a Guinness World Record for being the first woman to cross the English Channel by paramotor. She certainly made an entrance every time she landed in remote communities to talk to hunters, farmers and schoolchildren, and promote the importance of protecting these birds.“People would arrive from miles around to ask, ‘Where have you come from? Isn’t it dangerous?’ ‘How can I help?’ So this was an incredible way to introduce the swans – people won’t forget that encounter and it helps change the culture.”\u0026nbspPower lines are a constant danger for migrating birds such as Bewick’s and ospreys, so Dench is excited that a new citizen-science app, e-faunalert, enables anyone to report bird collisions.“Power lines are a big part of our renewable energy future but they must be clearly visible and installed away from bird migration hotspots,” she says. “The data from this app will help build a picture of where bird collisions are the biggest problem.”Bewick’s swans live for 25 years so new data is slow to arrive, but the last count showed that the population is starting to grow. “The expedition can’t not have had an impact – we reframed the conversation and got people talking – that must have affected the wildlife,” says Dench, who once again will engage with local communities in Europe and Africa as she investigates the threats to ospreys and other migratory birds using the flyway.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7952bc78b99a4b4d808b1ec24c48921b3352886/0_380_4368_2620/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6a013f5faba222b0d57d3911532878c","title":"city crumbles as the sands shift on senegals coast in pictures","story":"Nicky Woo has won the Marilyn Stafford award 2020 with her project As the Water Comes, documenting rising sea levels in Saint-Louis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0c50bb40c01464c26f442a2f9d96ecec89fb3f2/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55e1a81b07a402ee0883d58008b3db02 660w","title":"how to wear a chain like normal peoples connell waldron","story":"The BBC drama has reignited our love of the neck chain – perfect for those who like their accessories subtleMen’s jewellery has been “bubbling under” for a while. By which I mean that male peacocks of the Hollywood, music and street style variety have been wearing bright and shiny accessories for years now. In these circles, Harry Styles popularised the renaissance-referencing pearl earring and A$AP Rocky signet ring.But never has a piece of men’s jewellery gone mainstream until now. In the depths of lockdown, we all binge-watched Normal People and, as a slightly delirious nation, anthropomorphised Connell Waldron’s (played by Paul Mescal) chain, elevating it to National Heart-throb status. The necklace’s charms were subtle. So subtle, in fact, that had we not been in the throes of a universal pause, it might have gone entirely unnoticed.This was, in part, to do with the fact that it wasn’t overdesigned. It was very simple: thin and silver – not so much a wink or raised eyebrow of a chain, more a furtive glance. And for that it was something that normal people (sorry) could embrace.My style is quite minimal when it comes to jewellery. I’ve never even had my ears pierced. I’ve toyed with a skull ring (too wannabe rock star) and once wore a pendant on a leather chain, but only for a fancy dress party. Wearing this chain, I get way too neurotic and overthink it. Am I doing this right? Is it hanging correctly over my collar? And, bafflingly, does it make my ears look big?I find the chain works best when it’s offset by a plain colour in this look, I’m saving the tie-dye for my trousers (by streetwear label Aries Arise). It also speaks to simplicity and lightness, making it an ideal accessory to pair with summer colours: here, I’ve chosen a rich lilac T-shirt.The thing is, once I settle into it, I like wearing the chain a lot. I’m no Mescal, I’m not even Mescal adjacent, but I do feel empowered.

This is basically a two-hour dollop of action-movie product, teased out to look like a superhero origin story and touting (weakly) for the possible beginnings of a franchise property. DC Comics writer Greg Rucka has adapted his own graphic novel series of the same title and the director is Gina Prince-Bythewood, whose debut movie Love and Basketball from 20 years ago – about a young woman with a gift for basketball – I still remember fondly. That had a humanity and idealism that seems far away from this ponderous stuff, which is crucially lacking in the humour that might have sold the essential silliness of its premise.Charlize Theron appears in the badass mode that is an important part of her screen persona: previously seen in Fast \u0026amp Furious, Atomic Blonde, Aeon Flux and of course Mad Max: Fury Road. These days, she doesn’t appear comfortable unless she’s sporting an asymmetrical short haircut, dark glasses and a couple of Glocks. She plays Andy, the leader of a tough crew of mercenaries who get hired for large amounts of money to do dangerous stuff helping her are Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli). These soldiers of fortune have a secret: they are immortal. For decades and in fact centuries, they have been battling on the side of righteousness, standing up for the oppressed. There are some very ridiculous “olden-dayes” flashbacks showing Theron in ancient warrior headdresses solemnly galloping around on a horse.Over the years, they’ve also supposedly been doing good by saving the lives of people whose children or grandchildren will one day do stuff like cure polio, although how they have the foresight to do this is a mystery, because prophecy is not among their gifts. The script also briefly concedes that they have to work for the bad guys once in a while (although this distasteful necessity is not shown) in orde to stockpile cash for food, guns, ammo and so on. But immortality is their sole superpower: they don’t have super-strength, or the ability to fly or be invisible. They are essentially no stronger and smarter than any of the ex-special-forces people that they wind up getting into fights with. It’s just that when you shoot or stab them, the wound heals up and they start over. Their millennia-long existence comes to a crisis when a new immortal joins their vampiric ranks: USMC officer Nile, played by KiKi Layne (from Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk). And a certain shadowy CIA officer Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) approaches them with a deal, at the behest of creepy corporate kingpin Merrick (Harry Melling).Theron always brings a certain hauteur and dash to her action and martial-arts sequences and Layne has real screen presence. It’s a pity that more of the movie could not have been about the meet-cute mentoring “soromance” between Andy and Nile. The adjective in the title is right. It gets old pretty quickly.• The Old Guard is available on 10 July on Netflix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ccfddbc81e4aaff12f2e55566b15d54517e685/0_287_8660_5199/master/8660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c2d04c800ecb86d0b2a35fc2d950f36","title":"how to eat pasta salad","story":"This month, How to Eat is tackling the pasta salad. Is mayonnaise ever an acceptable dressing? Should you ever opt for shop-bought? And is eating it ‘al desko’ a big part of the problem?What is it about pasta salad that people find so triggering? “Nothing on this earth will ever lead me to make a pasta salad,” wrote Nigel Slater in 2006, describing the concept as “disgusting”. Almost 15 years later, its ability to summon the unbending militant in otherwise reasonable, mild-mannered food writers is undimmed. In May, Diana Henry tweeted: “Two words I do not want to hear together: PASTA SALAD.”Had Henry been more exact, and specified creamy pasta salad, How to Eat could have given that a like. Possibly created by the fusion of Germanic potato salads and Italian pasta, mayo-drenched pasta salads are, as Daniel Gritzer once put it: “One of the worst things to ever come out of the American kitchen.” And, to be fair, that is not a short list.But How to Eat (HTE) – the series identifying how best to enjoy Britain’s favourite dishes – takes a more nuanced view of the wider pasta salad spectrum. Without the mayo and, given the right treatment, this carby combo of pasta and dressed veg can shine. How to Eat asks you to give, if not peace, then pasta salads a chance.But first, let’s lay down some ground rules for a dish that, in polite foodie circles, dare not speak its name.… is an oxymoron. That, my friend, is pasta. A pasta dish. Not a salad. The best pasta salads combine cooked ingredients, but are designed so that those cooked ingredients will work their magic at room temperature, not lukewarm from the pan. Unless you think carbonara is a salad?Rarely can a food’s reputation have suffered so much, not because of what it is, but how it is usually eaten. Cast your mind back to the pre-Covid world, where people occupied hutch-like work-units called offices. Invariably, that is where you would find yourself eating a pasta salad al desko, or – if eating in front of your computer was too painful a reminder of your enslavement to the late-capitalist machine – sitting on a bench on a windy precinct, picking at your meagre supermarket pasta salad with a spindly plastic fork. Beating The Man, but still miserable. Dreaming instead of a hot bag of Greggs swag.It would be difficult to take pleasure in any cold food in those dreary circumstances, much less a tub of fridge-cold, factory-processed pasta in a vinegary dressing. HTE has no truck with the passive-aggressive snobbery that everything tastes better if you make it yourself. It could name 101 products that the industrial (fast) food complex has nailed, from ice-cream to chicken kiev. Making pizza at home is more punishment than pleasure.But get to work charring vegetables, stoning olives, chopping herbs and whisking up a simple lemon and olive oil dressing and, undoubtedly, once that marinates together for a few hours in the tub, you will have something – please read the next section in the smuggest voice you can muster – vastly superior to anything you can buy off the shelf. Importantly, pasta salad is also immeasurably improved by eating it out of a sturdy container with a fork that does not bend, and doing so after it has had a chance to warm up, rather than straight from the supermarket chiller cabinet. Your salad needs to reach room temperature so that the compounds that give foods their flavours have sufficient energy to exhibit their natural volatility.This is a dish usually eaten on the move. Therefore, it needs to be easily transferrable from receptacle A (Tupperware) to receptacle B (your gaping cakehole) without any cutting and wrestling. It should be simply forkable: you need to be able to pierce and pin down your pasta and other ingredients, later scooping up the dregs, ideally in a way that allows you to get a little bit of everything in each mouthful. To that end, the ingredients must be cut small enough that none are larger than the pasta shape you have chosen, which should be diddy enough (penne, fusilli, farfalle, orechiette, conchiglie etc) that you can get a few in your mouth in one go.In a way, the success of a pasta salad is a test of your commitment: are you prepared to chop fastidiously enough to make it work? Want to use tiny, silky rice-like orzo? That is a discerning choice, but it will require you to painstakingly dice the other ingredients down. It is worth the effort. You are, to paraphrase L’Oreal, worth it.Some quite incredible recipes suggest spaghetti, pappardelle and other noodles for salads. Good luck with that. And the clean-up operation. Your aforementioned workstation (now box-bedroom-ad-hoc-laptop-perch) will end up covered in stray bits of oil, parsley and tomato as you transfer twirling mop-heads of pasta to your gob. Since HTE recently over-enthusiastically hoovered up its # key, it is now avoiding all foods that might require it to later clean a keyboard.It may seem perverse to discuss the dressing before the ingredients. But that is the thing about a salad dressing. It gets everywhere. It is all pervading. It matters. A lot. HTE has already established that creamy pasta salads, dripping in mayonnaise or, worse, salad cream, are a gloypy chore (“gloypy” meaning gluey and gloopy). Even the perkiest flavours are muffled by that heavy coating of fat. Sour cream is a sprightlier option but tends not to cling to pasta, collecting instead at the bottom of the tub.Commercial olive oil-dressed pasta salads are marginally better but, typically, sweet and vinegary in a clumsily unbalanced way. Far from being natural allies, vinegar and pasta are actively antagonistic, combining to create strangely astringent, metallic flavours. Use lemon juice in your olive oil dressing. It is more forgiving. Otherwise, keep it simple: chopped herbs, salt, pepper, a little finely chopped chilli or mild Tabasco if you want some heat (no mustard or crazier hot sauces this is not a raucous gig).If in doubt, pesto it out. HTE is firmly of the belief that pesto, even the worst pesto, bulked-out with bamboo fibres and potato flakes, makes everything better.Confusingly, raw salad ingredients (tomato, cucumber, celery, the dreaded grated carrot, onion) do not work in pasta salads. This is not a garden salad into which you can lob some macaroni. Thankfully, the inexplicable habit of sitting pasta salads on a bed of rocket has also largely ceased.Instead, pasta salads require cured, processed or cooked ingredients that retain a firm or clearly differentiated texture (no slimy spinach, mushy green beans or flabby mushrooms) and that, when cool, still deliver an explosion of flavour. Abide by those two rules and you will not go far wrong. For instance, if adding meat, you would not add woolly, flavour-deficient shredded chicken, expensive prosciutto or bacon. Who wants to eat cold, congealed bacon? But you might well chop a few punchy sausages through a pasta salad or fry a little chorizo, with the added bonus that the oil released can be used as the base for your dressing.There may be nothing intrinsically Italian about pasta salad (the 2005 edition of The Silver Spoon contains just two pasta salad recipes and one of those is for curried penne), but, unsurprisingly, in order to achieve a satisfying balance – sunshine-filled but not overly sweet flavours, something tangy to punctuate them, a bass note of umami to anchor everything – Mediterranean flavours are not a bad place to start.For instance, puttanesca’s core components (garlic, capers, olives, passata, anchovies for savoury roundness and heft perhaps a few preserved artichoke hearts for luck), can be deployed hot or cold. Likewise, using three variations on the tomato: good quality sun-dried, roasted and tinned, you could whip up something pretty great, again using juices from the roasted tomatoes as the dressing’s base. Charring, roasting and toasting everything from peppers and broccoli to pine nuts or almonds, will help build up layers of flavour, but, as per the Washington Post’s advice, do not overload your salad with too many ingredients. Think Rothko or Reich. Less is more.While some ingredients immediately rule themselves out – asparagus is too prissy peas feel juvenile (use broad beans instead) posh seafood seems an egregious waste – cheese has its uses, while also being woefully overused. Utilising finely grated parmesan, grana padano or pecorino as seasoning works (do not go OTT, this is not a cheese salad), as does feta, well crumbled so it almost “emulsifies” in any excess liquid to become a secondary dressing, so creating a dressing duet.Using mozzarella cold, however, when it so often tastes bland and grainy is a baffling error. It adds nothing. Nor do ricotta or burrata, which, in order to fully shine, in their mild, intensely creamy ways, need to be showcased on the plate and offset with piquant sauces and sharper vegetables, rather than being sparingly tumbled together in a salad where they are likely to disintegrate.Lunch (AKA dinner, up north). Like a three-chord punk classic, pasta salad achieves perfection in its brevity and simplicity. The pasta salad is a dish of limited flavours compelling in a compact serving. Were you to eat a bucket of it for tea, it might get rather boring – like a triple-vinyl, prog rock epic that thinks it is far deeper than it is.So, pasta salad. How do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5742c0b971dd3c0a87bc24b2171515b34464a63f/131_0_1701_1021/master/1701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bd91f46922736d855142d73a9e6549c","title":"the pinnacle of storytelling reader reviews of the last of us part ii","story":"‘A phenomenal follow-up’ or ‘a boring slog’?  readers have their say about the hit video games sequelBeyond being one of the most visually and technically stunning games, the story forces the player to face the consequences of choices made in the first game and refuses to shy away from the pain of those choices. The main character and the player come to the realisation that a cycle of perpetual violence is the result of vengeance and only forgiveness can help us heal. While focusing on issues like transgender rights and homophobia, PTSD, loyalty, and survival, the game also gives representation to a multitude of different women, with varying personalities, motives, and dimensions. A phenomenal follow-up to its iconic original. Erin McDonagh, 26, student and retail associate, TorontoRather than taking a safe and ‘predictable’ route with the story, Naughty Dog has sought to do something special by taking huge risks on a big AAA game. The main character (Ellie) is a lesbian in a relationship with a bisexual woman (Dina). This is a tremendous accomplishment for LGBTQ representation in the largely straight cis male dominated gaming world. Couple this with the fact that the game also features a transgender character and was released during Pride month? Ground-breaking. Antonio Navarrete, 26, accountant, CaliforniaI grew up loving the first game. I was 13 when I played it and I used to fall asleep to the main menu music because it was so peaceful. That’s how the whole game felt even in a world of distraction and death, the deaths meant something. But the second game was just death, upon death, upon death. It was genuinely depressing to watch all the characters I loved – like Ellie, Joel and Tommy – lose everything, for it to be all in vain. In the end we’re just left with two broken, soulless girls fighting each other, and for what? It broke me. Elena Mekhtieva, 20, student, LondonThe graphics, acting and gameplay are first class. But about 20 hours in, when the game reaches what seems to be a devastating and realistic climax, Naughty Dog loses the plot and, without warning, I found myself playing as the character I had just spent the last 20 hours trying to kill. All the emotion and tension drained away and the game became a boring slog through all the same sort of stuff I’d been doing for the previous twenty20 hours, just now playing as a character I neither cared about or particularly liked. From then on the story just became tedious and increasingly unbelievable. The Last of Us Part II could have been Game of the Year but the second half ruins it. Anonymous, 69A perfect sequel and a masterpiece on its own. Despite Joel’s early death, this game is still about him and Ellie. Their relationship is as complex and heart-warming as ever. There is also new depth in the themes – vengeance, violence and hate are delivered in a powerful way – as well as in the character development. Playing as Abby added a lot to the experience, and I still can’t believe I went from hating Abby for killing Joel, to being happy about her surviving. An intriguing story, complex characters, rock solid combat mechanics, and gorgeous graphics, as well as an immersive world and atmospheric music – Part II is the pinnacle of storytelling in video games. Pauliina Kivistö, 28, student, FinlandIt was disappointing to see the game shift from the relationship between Joel and Ellie, to some bleak revenge story that doesn’t get fulfilled. The gameplay is boring, and the story is not at all immersive. I don’t think the creators of the game did our characters any justice. Ellie feels completely different and is not the same girl so many fell in love with in the first game. . It feels very unreal, and the emotions and moods don’t make much sense, neither does the narrative. I have never felt so let down. Noor Randhawa, 19, pre-med student, MontrealI was blown away several times in the first couple of hours gripping, emotional and often shocking, but this time the execution is almost flawless. Gestures, expressions and body language are more detailed and convincing than any game I’ve played. Enemies are people, with names and friends who care about them. The killing is graphic and inescapable, and it’s never easy. There are consequences. One perfectly crafted detail that sums up this game is the little hiss as your stealth kill’s last breath escapes the wound in their neck. The Last of Us Part II will be impossible to forget.

Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.Potatoes Pile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.WholegrainsChoosing wholegrain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way of boosting your fibre intake. Unlike the refined grains used in white bread and pasta, whole grains include the bran, the fibre-rich outer layer that gets stripped when grain is refined. Remember to check the label on any packets you buy so you can be sure about the ingredients, fibre content and nutritional values. European regulations state that a product claiming to be a source of fibre should contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100 kcal, while a product claiming to be high fibre should contain double those figures.Wheat bran A daily intake of 10g of wheat-bran fibre is known to support your gut health by helping to accelerate the transit of food through your intestines. An easy way to boost your intake is by eating breakfast cereals high in wheat-bran fibre, such as the Kellogg’s high fibre range, which includes Bran Flakes, All-Bran Original and Fruit \u0026amp Fibre.Oats These are another handy breakfast option. Oats are known to provide a type of fibre often referred to as soluble fibre. This fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel in the gut, which can beneficially impact digestion and metabolism. Remember oats aren’t just used to make porridge but are the basis of muesli, oatcakes and oat bread.Leafy vegetables Parents down the generations have told children to “eat up your greens”, and it turns out they were right. For example, broccoli and kale can provide a source of fibre.Probiotics and fermented foods We can enrich the ersity of our gut microbiome by eating probiotics – technically defined as live bacteria that, when consumed in a viable form and adequate amounts, are beneficial to health. Kefir, a fermented milk drink, is an example of a food providing a probiotic source. Such foods may complement a fibre-rich diet, in the context of gut health. Other fermented foods such as certain yoghurts, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi are examples of probiotic sources.Bulgur wheatIf you’re bored of potatoes but need something on the side, this wholewheat grain is your friend. It comes in four sizes, from fine to very coarse, and is great as a basis for salads. Mix it with anything from tomatoes and cucumber to parsley and lettuce, for a tasty side dish.PulsesThese come in all sorts of varieties, with some of the most familiar being lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans. All three contain fibre, as well as resistant starch, and can be added to soups, stews, curries or salads.Nuts and seedsPumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds are handy if you’re looking for a fibre snack while on the go. Nuts and seeds can be sprinkled on stir fries, blitzed into curries, stirred into homemade cereal bars, or added to breakfast cereals. And don’t forget nut butters, which come in varieties such as cashew and almond as well as peanut.Assorted fruitsIf you fancy something sweeter, remember that plenty of fruits contain fibre, such as strawberries, blackberries and pomegranates. Avocados might be savoury but they are a fruit, and another good option.BananasWhen green, these are a good source of resistant starch. As a rule of thumb, the greener the banana, the more resistant starch it contains, so try to eat them before they turn completely yellow.PrebioticsFibre reaches the large intestine undigested. Once there, some types of fibre become “food” for the good bacteria in our gut. These types of fibre are referred to as prebiotics. Small amounts can be found in foods such as chicory root, onions, garlic and artichokes. But you can also opt for foods with added prebiotic fibre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c45d236e06fcc16619994d9934c63d06b061628/755_171_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac7cc57b8c0ed2fccdf9e9390835eda","title":"embarrassing accident holding up broken hands sad t rex romesh ranganathan","story":"I am unable to button up trousers, open boxes, or turn the key to our front door This week I broke my wrist and dislocated my thumb while filming a bike race segment for a show I’m working on. It’s too embarrassing to go into details, but let’s just say that the disparity between potential danger and subsequent injury has never been wider. Nobody on the shoot foresaw any possible way anyone could hurt themselves, and so I was faced with the humiliating implication that my lack of coordination was something not even a detailed risk assessment could account for.It’s difficult to know how you will react to injury until it happens, and I can report that it turns out I overreact massively. I saw my thumb looking as if it wanted to emigrate from my hand, and I had to be given gas and air. My wife didn’t even have that when she gave birth to each of our three boys.I walked off the site to be taken to hospital, where I was put in a plaster cast and sent home. I’m going to be absolutely honest: I was quite looking forward to the sympathy when I got back, and much of my journey was spent practising sorry-for-myself faces and holding up my broken hands like a sad T rex.On opening the door, my wife’s first question was whether I could wipe my own arse. I said I hoped so. I was pretty sure I could, but part of me was tempted to pretend I couldn’t, just once, for a laugh. But I wasn’t sure she would find it funny, so decided to leave it.I have since discovered – and this may sound like the least insightful observation on anatomy – that opposable thumbs are really quite useful. I am unable to button up trousers, though that rarely comes up while working from home. I am unable to open boxes, which thanks to my online shopping addiction has been happening a lot since the lockdown I do not have enough strength in my hands to turn the key to our front door. My wife has pointed out that it’s not my inability to do these things that’s annoying – it’s the fact that I seem to be enjoying it.The most upsetting thing in this whole saga has been the dispensing of hot sauce. I use a squeezy bottle of hot sauce on pretty much everything bar my breakfast cereal (and once on that, too, just to see). I don’t think I possess talent in many areas, but one of the things I am exceptional at is ascertaining exactly how much hot sauce is required to be squeezed out for the amount of food on the plate. There are a number of factors to be considered, including absorption, structural integrity, and level of flavour intrinsic to the foodstuffs.I have been forced to ask my wife to do the honours, and it has been a shambles. The sauce wastage has been criminal. I haven’t said that to her directly, but I think she can tell when she clears the plates away. (Obviously I am completely unable to assist, because of my injuries.)Today I had an online doctor’s appointment. It’s the first time I’ve been naked from the waist down with a doctor without being asked. It felt liberating, but midway through I became paranoid that somehow he knew. He told me that the fracture wasn’t too bad, and that I could lose the plaster cast and move to a splint, which would give me more use of my hand. This runs the very real risk of ruining the Holiday From Helping Out that I have been enjoying over the last few days. Still, it might be worth it for the return to hot sauce normality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44a915085ea5222dad21787c05fff10fafebbe59/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81fba320ae2963ec8b2fb81dcce8f4ec","title":"my half sister has rejected my parents who is really to blame","story":"You have cast yourself as a rescuer, says Annalisa Barbieri, but it’s not your job to make everything OKI’m in my 20s, and the child of two people who had previous marriages and children. Growing up, both my parents shared custody with their former partners at weekends, the house would be full. I believed as a child that this was a blissfully happy family. I was very close with all of my half-siblings and particularly close to one of them. When I was of primary school age, my parents told me that this sister wouldn’t be coming over because she had decided she didn’t want anything more to do with us. After that I only saw her once. I was devastated.  When I was a teenager, my sister reached out to me and we had a casual virtual relationship over a few years. I stopped when I found out she’d said something negative about my parents. She believes she was the victim of emotional abuse. I would never want to say that wasn’t true as it obviously is for her, but it still makes me unbelievably upset. Although I was younger, I know how much love there was in our family. I feel as if she has constructed a narrative for herself that makes her past seem worse than it was.When I was at university, I wrote her a long letter I felt as if she had abandoned me. I was very angry with her, told her my feelings and that, while I understood her pain, I felt as if she had placed all the blame on my father. Her reply was short, and it was clear she wasn’t happy with the way I felt about it and doesn’t want anything to change. I feel that I’ll never really get over it until I have answers, but I also feel very scared to have answers because it may taint the perspective I have of my childhood. Should I try to forget and move on, or have a discussion with my parents about it?As you are seeing, each sibling in a family will have their own perspective on their upbringing. It’s good you acknowledge that, because her truth is no less valid than yours.I understand you felt abandoned, but she was rejecting your parents, not you. She made some effort to get in touch with you. I wonder how she reacted to a letter that was basically telling her (from the sound of it) that what she did was wrong and how she could put things right? I wonder if a more inquiring letter might have opened the conversation more, but I also understand that you fear tainting your own memories. What do your other siblings say? Might they paint a fuller picture for you?I contacted Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist (psychotherapy.org.uk), and she acknowledged that you have a “core belief of a blissfully happy childhood and your half-sister’s perspective really shakes that belief”. Burke also felt that, for whatever reason, you instinctively understood – even as a child – that to talk about your own “feelings of confusion and loss would upset your dadparents further”. So you suppressed your own feelings. There was a strand throughout your longer letter that somehow you felt, or still feel, your parents’ feelings were more important than yours.And yet, to have a sibling disappear out of your life, with no real explanation or space for you to ask questions, is no small thing. No wonder you were devastated. I wonder if being angry at your sister is easier than being angry at your folks?Burke also talked to me about the drama triangle. In this there’s a perpetrator, a victim and a rescuer, and you seem to have given yourself the role of rescuer. Whatever happened, happened between your half-sister and the adults, “and you’ve inserted yourself into it and want to rescue it and make it all right,” Burke suggests. But it’s not your job to make it OK.You clearly can’t forget about it. What I have done with highly complex family situations is, over time, listened to as many people’s versions of their truth as possible and eventually formed my own edit. When you feel stronger, perhaps you can do this and apply some critical thinking to the situation – always a good skill to learn in life, because things are rarely black and white.You and your sister seem at the opposite ends of the memory spectrum: hers dark, yours all bright, “and you may need to live with the greyness of things,” Burke says.I would also consider a less contentious approach to your sister she clearly means a lot to you. Childhoods are rarely totally idyllic or awful but made up of a patchwork of real-life incidents.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

Like you’re 2ft tall? I know the feeling.”Hearing your real voice can be a confronting experience. For me, it’s an occupational hazard. Every interview I’ve played back, I’ve had to hear my voice. And it turns out I have a few.There’s “friend voice”, spoken in my native MLE (Multicultural London English), and which I tone down in my formal, generically southern “work voice”. Then there’s the “Auntie whisperer”, a style I slip into with Asian elders, mirroring their inflections.But recently I have found myself speaking in something wholly new: my “lockdown voice”, a grossly embarrassing blend of the baby voice I use with my partner, MLE, and Gollum-inspired catchphrases from binge-watching Lord Of The Rings. (“Nasty little orangeses!” I once exclaimed at the sight of some bruised supermarket fruit.)Perhaps you have noticed it, too – a speaking style that reflects your smaller social circle. Science backs it up: accents develop during long periods of isolation, circumstances that seemed impossible in our hyper-connected age, until now.Our accents, our vocal styles and tones are a palimpsest of history – adapting, but carrying an imprint of the past. I think of my future voices and wonder what new reality they will reflect: what friends and moments will be the influence? As for my lockdown voice, as measures ease it’s likely to be deprived of the isolated time it needs to fully stick. I’m glad I can’t see it endearing me to future interview subjects.

It can only be driven again once it has passed another test.Lee Griffin of price comparison website GoCompare said drivers who used the extension to knowingly drive a car with safety defects could still be prosecuted.“Drivers are responsible for their cars’ condition and they are expected to carry out regular safety checks to ensure that it is safe and roadworthy,” he said.“We are urging drivers not to ignore any dashboard warning lights and, if they have any concerns about the condition of their car to take it to be repaired.

Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

Until the late 1800s, parliament would rise on the first Wednesday in June to allow the honourable members to join the throng. Derby Day has been inspiring paintings, films, novels and plays for more than 200 years, and the vast, sprawling mass of humanity mingling on Epsom Downs has always had a central role in the story.But not this year. For the first time since it was founded in 1780, the People’s Race will be run without The People. In earlier times of crisis, the Derby has occasionally moved from its traditional home, or the familiar date in early June. In 1917, it switched to Newmarket in late July. But never before has the Derby’s public not merely been discouraged from attending but banned from Epsom outright. Ten years short of the Classic’s 250th birthday, this will be a Derby Day like no other.Epsom’s plan to keep the public a long way away from the action on Saturday was approved by the local council as long ago as 12 May. The track is built on public land – which is why at least 100,000 people can turn up and watch for free in a normal year, in addition to 40,000 in the stands – and so permission was required to close it off, even for just 24 hours. Several miles of temporary fencing will enclose the course and surroundings, and the organisers are pleading with fans to get the message, stay away and watch on television instead.What no one could have foreseen in May, of course, was that the first Derby to be held in July for more than a century would coincide with England’s pubs opening their doors for the first time since March. That adds an element of uncertainty to the proceedings which Epsom could surely do without, and they can only hope that would-be racegoers will heed the words of their hero, Frankie Dettori.“Please don’t come to the Downs,” Dettori said this week on Twitter. “There’s a three-mile fence around the place, so sit back and enjoy it on ITV. I hope I can win it for you. Ciao.”Millions of punters will hope so, too, and as the result of an old-fashioned “jocking off”, Dettori certainly has a favourite’s chance on English King. Tom Marquand rode English King to win his trial at Lingfield last month, but when it became clear that Dettori did not have an obvious ride, Bjorn Nielsen, the colt’s owner, moved swiftly and decisively to get the Italian into the saddle.It was a move with echoes of the pre-race intrigue that so often ended up with Lester Piggott on a Derby favourite in the 1970s.Dettori’s overall record in the Derby – two wins from 24 rides – is several furlongs adrift of Piggott’s nine from 36. But his reputation as a rider for the biggest occasions definitely stands comparison, and Dettori will need to draw on all his experience and self-confidence if he is to become the first rider since Kieren Fallon, aboard Oath in 1999, to win the Derby from stall one.Fallon, like Piggott, was the undisputed master of Epsom in his prime. “When the draw came out, I remember Willie Ryan told me that stall one was the coffin box,” he said this week. “But if you’re riding a horse that travels, it doesn’t make a difference. At Epsom, it’s all about momentum and pace and positioning, and if you enjoy that you’ll ride it well.“Tom Marquand is a rising star but Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys we’ve seen for a long, long time and possibly we won’t see one like him again, in the way he rides, not only here but all over the world.”Racing’s greatest showman on the Epsom favourite in July, behind barricades built to keep his audience out. In this most difficult and disturbing of years, it feels like the plot of another novel set on Derby Day, with only the final chapter yet to be written."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccf108eb885c8459641d613a57dd150592dbdaf9/299_701_3066_1839/master/3066.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f5195953e9e657d952d8c1320a73f552","title":"agatha christie the mousetrap socially distanced west end reopening","story":"World’s longest-running show plans to welcome back reduced audiences in October as ‘first step in restoring live theatre’Its record-breaking 67-year run in London was cut short in March by the coronavirus outbreak but The Mousetrap now plans to resume performances in autumn. Agatha Christie’s whodunnit, the longest-running show in the world, aims to reopen on 23 October as one of the West End’s first socially distanced productions.When it does, the theatre will reduce its capacity of 550 by around two-thirds, depending on the size of household groups attending. The plans have been put together in compliance with stage four of the the government’s five-point “roadmap” for the return of live theatre performances. Stage four will see “performances allowed indoorsoutdoors (but with a limited distance audience)”, although no specific timescales were included in the government’s strategy when it was announced last week.Adam Spiegel, The Mousetrap’s producer, said he recognised it is not viable for the majority of West End productions to operate with social distancing measures in place for the cast, audience and backstage staff. “We are very fortunate with The Mousetrap that, with the help of our stakeholders, we are able to adapt our economic model to be able to reopen. Whilst this cannot be a long-term exercise, we believe it is a crucial first step in restoring live theatre to the London landscape.” He said that putting Christie’s name “back up in lights” on the theatre’s famous sign would herald “the beginning of the end of a very dark time in the history of the theatre”.The Mousetrap has been performed 28,200 times in London and sold more than 10m tickets. It was originally adapted from Christie’s radio play Three Blind Mice, written for the royal family in 1947."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75932c3a0c7cfc3332b40c6eb08b65da59aa952f/140_0_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3d9f88bbf88bf02db66391b2f6268bc","title":"designers wrap uk theatres scene change","story":"Pink barrier tape reading ‘Missing Live Theatre’ will be attached to venues as part of an initiative for the ailing industryThe easing of coronavirus restrictions means that England’s theatres are permitted to reopen from 4 July, albeit without live performance. But many major UK venues are not in a position to open their doors yet. A new design project has been launched to wrap some of these empty buildings with a bright message of hope amid the industry’s deepening crisis.The #scenechange project will see theatres in the UK and Ireland wrapped with pink barrier tape reading “Missing Live Theatre”. It has been organised by a community of designers who work in theatre and want to bring “joy and colour” to venues that currently stand empty, devoid of their usual hustle and bustle. “Theatres which are usually teeming with life feel stark and bleak,” they said, “some even shut away behind hazard tape to prevent them inadvertently being places of gathering.”The first building to be wrapped was the National Theatre on the South Bank in London, where casual staff in front of house and backstage positions were told on Friday that they are being let go. The NT has said it is unable to continue paying them beyond August due to the changes in the coronavirus job retention scheme, and added that staff roles are now at risk of redundancy.The project was created by the SceneChange community, which has more than 1,000 members including leading set and costume designers such as Es Devlin, Bunny Christie, Rae Smith and Tom Piper. The community said that designers will play an essential role in “the transformation that will see theatres being reopened and reimagined” in the future. It aims to link theatres up with local designers for on-site installation of the pink barrier tape, which will remain around each theatre for up to a week before it is removed and reused on another theatre.Matthew Warchus, the artistic director of the Old Vic in London, said he was delighted to support the campaign: “Theatres are the lifeblood of the communities in which they sit, buzzing day and night with people seeking solace, inspiration, escapism, fun and education. It is heartbreaking that these creative spaces, like our own beloved 202-year-old theatre, remain closed to all those who make theatre so special. Alongside those designers who created #scenechange, we hope this campaign will remind people of the joy of live theatre.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/264a6e3d586319335bafc58c21d753e283a29e4f/0_278_4618_2771/master/4618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e16ffe2777a70dba3373afa9956c8817","title":"can britons book their summer holidays now and other questions answered","story":"Everything you need to know about Britain’s new travel arrangementsThe UK Foreign Office (FCO) has updated its travel advice to allow for non-essential travel to 59 countries and territories that it no longer deems high risk for British travellers. Holidays can go ahead to countries on the “safe list” from 10 July. Passengers (both returning Brits and international tourists) arriving from these countries will not face quarantine.Currently this list, which is under constant review, is for England only, but the other devolved governments are expected to accept the list. Within the UK, the Welsh border is due to open to tourists from Monday 6 July, Scotland is aiming for 15 July, while Northern Ireland has already reopened.Not necessarily. Each country will have its own rules on who can enter, regardless of whether the UK says it safe to travel there. Some countries may not permit UK nationals to enter and they may ban anyone who has been in the UK in the previous two weeks. For example, despite Greece being on the list of safe countries, UK tourists must still quarantine for 14 days on arrival, and there is a ban on direct flights until 15 July.Security measures in place at borders could also prevent potential loopholes for passengers to transit through other “safe” countries first and dodge travel bans. Sit tight if your chosen destination is not yet on the list, as more countries are expected to be added in the coming weeks – and some airlines and hotels are offering fee-free date changes if you cannot travel at a certain time. If you attempt to travel to a country for which the FCO advice has not changed, be aware you could be turned away at the airport (unless you can prove the journey is essential and not a holiday), or you may face restrictions such as quarantine measures in the holiday destination or on your return to the UK.The onboard experience will feel very different. Most airlines (and airports) have made face masks mandatory and you could be refused boarding without one. Bringing several for longer journeys is recommended, with British Airways and EasyJet suggesting you change your mask every four hours. Use of the toilet will be managed by cabin crew, in some cases queuing may not be allowed. Other measures in some airports include temperature screenings, additional hand-sanitising stations, limited food and drink, and floor markings to encourage social distancing.Online check-in, avoiding touching surfaces and restrictions on hand luggage (which Italy has banned from 26 July) are also among the government’s list of recommendations. Most low-cost airlines are already operating flights around Europe, with schedules increasing over the coming weeks. The much-debated issue of leaving the middle seat free has not led to any regulation, although some carriers beyond Europe are limiting capacity.How close you can get to others and how strictly it is enforced depends on the country and the activity – although overall 1.5-2 metres is commonly expected in public places. In many of the UK’s favourite holiday destinations, this applies in tourist attractions, museums and galleries, some of which will require booking a timeslot in advance. Cafes, bars and restaurants are also limiting capacity in many areas, and may only offer al fresco seating. Many nightclubs remain closed too – major venues in the party capitals of Ibiza, Amsterdam and Berlin are among the destinations pausing parties this summer. Buffets have been scrapped in many hotels in favour of table and room service and some spas will stay closed, or limit treatments or access.Unless you’re heading for a wild stretch of coast, there are rules for beaches in many popular holiday spots. Mobile phone tracking on the Belgian coast drones in Spain and reservations for some French beaches are among the tactics in place to combat overcrowding. Sun loungers and parasols are being kept apart on many beaches, some within marked squares – and in hotels you may have to book in advance. Both chlorinated and saltwater pools are expected to be open to guests, but social distancing will still apply both in and out of the water – potentially with underwater markings and queuing systems. Public pools will also limit capacity, some may also ban floatation aids, and changing rooms and indoor pools could remain closed.Cross-border rail routes across Europe are beginning to operate again, and as many countries require face masks to be worn in public, trains are rarely an exception. Amenities such as bike storage and catering also vary depending on country, so check before you travel. Other public transport, including trams, metros and buses also require the wearing of face masks in many countries, as do taxis, some of which are limiting capacity per ride. In terms of car hire, new measures are up to inidual firms rather than regulation. Among its “safe travels” recommendations, the World Travel and Tourism Council advises rental companies to limit the number of customers at collection points, the introduction of curbside pick-up and drop-off, and enhanced cleaning regimes.Almost all travel insurance policies being sold right now specifically exclude Covid-19-related claims for cancellation and curtailment. While some will cover medical expenses if you catch the virus abroad, they will generally not pay if you were forced to spend two weeks in a local lockdown, or missed the flight home. If travel does take off in bigger numbers, expect more insurers to offer better terms, although they are still going through a backlog of claims from the first lockdown.The biggest risk is a second wave of infections and a Leicester-style lockdown that prevents you from leaving home. Anyone booking their own trip this week would be highly unlikely to be offered a refund if they couldn’t get the airport because of a local lockdown, and the holiday went ahead without them. Only one insurer is offering cancellation cover for recently booked trips. Annual travel policies offered by banks will not step in and pay out. A package holiday to, say, Spain would be covered if Spain was forced to shut down, and the tour operator had to cancel. Self-booked flights and an Airbnb would not.Last weekend’s tentative announcement led to a flurry of bookings and some of the best deals have gone. On the ferries to France, anyone hoping for a bargain has missed the boat. In the space of 24 hours, tickets on DFDS’s NewhavenDieppe, long seen as the value route to mid-France, shot up from £280 to £425. Prices of booking a PortsmouthSt Malo crossing with Brittany Ferries for popular weekend departures in August all top £900 return. Stena Line is now quoting £943 for a family of four to take return overnight crossings in August from Harwich to the Hook of Holland, the peaktime fare includes a cabin both ways.Emma Coulthurst, travel commentator from holiday price comparison site TravelSupermarket says good deals “are very much available” and with many opting for staycations, it is cheaper to book a break abroad than in the UK.“Seven night holiday packages from the UK for two adults and two children during the summer school holidays to the likes of Greece, Spain and Italy start from as little as £220 per person. It is normally difficult to find anything under £300pp for a week in August,” she says. “City break packages start from as little as £85pp for two nights, flight and accommodation included.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab545061e3fee2f5330f5d19989c653d3341395/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=873a34d1d552d2f55a0dff6193e71143","title":"living in hong kong are you thinking about settling in the uk","story":"We would like to hear from those eligible for the right to settle in the UK on whether they are thinking of leaving Hong KongIn response to the UK prime minister offering nearly 3 million residents in Hong Kong the right to settle in the UK, China has said it would take “corresponding measures” to stop it from happening.We would like to hear from people as to whether they are thinking of relocating to the UK or any other country.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056..

Police finally intercepted him as he approached a greenhouse at the far edge of the grounds. They said they were able to have “dialogue” with Hurren, lasting more than an hour and a half, before arresting him.“There was never any danger to the prime minister and his family nor to the governor general, as neither were on the grounds at the time of the incident,” Duheme said. He said Hurren had “several” weapons with him.Rideau Hall is the official residence of the governor general, Julie Payette, but Justin Trudeau and his family have been living at Rideau Cottage, in the grounds, during renovations to 24 Sussex, the prime minister’s official residence in Ottawa. According to maps of the area, Rideau Cottage is not far from the greenhouse.Hurren, who is believed to have driven 1,900km (1,180 miles) from Manitoba to Ottawa, runs a small sausage-making business called GrindHouse Fine Foods. In May, he posted on Facebook that the coronavirus pandemic had taken a devastating toll on his business.“I’m not sure what will be left of our economy, industries and businesses when this all ends,” he wrote.An hour before entering the grounds of Rideau hall, GrindHouse Fine Foods posted a picture of an outdoor party that would occur after the lockdown, directing people to to look up “Event 201”. The reference was to a conspiracy theory that Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, was responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic.Hurren’s company also posted a QAnon meme to Instagram in March, according to reporting from Vice News. “Has anyone else been following ‘Q’ and the ‘White Rabbit’ down the rabbit hole and how this all relates to the coronavirusCovid-19 situation? Lots of coincidences in all these ‘Q’ posts if this turns out to be a ‘Nothingburger’,” the caption said.Duheme said that after speaking to Hurren, police had a sense of his motives. He did not provide details and Hurren was not known to police at the time.The 13 minutes in which an armed intruder roamed the grounds of the prime minister’s residence has raised questions about a major lapse in security. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police plans to conduct a review of the incident and increase security in the area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/043d0b5d1962d3ec5bf9db71ea89c90f6da339f7/0_137_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e662623e929b4472992b5f15a9c2e213","title":"bolivia coronavirus pandemic","story":"Despite imposing an early lockdown, containment may be unravelling amid poverty, an underprepared health system and a bitter political standoff When Pedro Flores and a group of fellow doctors arrived in the Beni, Bolivia’s tropical northern province, at the end of May, they knew the crisis caused by coronavirus would be severe. But what they found still left them shaken.“The health system, public and private, collapsed,” said Flores. Many doctors in the regional capital of Trinidad fell ill. Other medical staff, terrified, locked themselves in at home or fled to remote farmhouses. As critically ill patients multiplied, the death toll began to climb.“There were no medical supplies, there were no ventilators, no oxygen,” explained Flores, who was initially hired by a local cattle ranchers’ association and has since returned as a volunteer. “Here in Trinidad most people have a relative, a friend, a neighbour who has died. We’re in a health disaster.”Since then, Covid-19 infections and deaths have proliferated – even in Bolivia’s western, highland half, which had been relatively unscathed. A regional human rights body expressed its “alarm” at hospitals leaving at least six patients to die in the street and fearful gravediggers turning away grieving families.Latin America is now the global centre of the pandemic, with more than 2 million cases, at least 100,000 dead, and little sign of the regional curve flattening. Bolivia’s 33,000 confirmed cases and over 1,100 deaths to date are still dwarfed by neighbouring Brazil – where the same number are perishing from Covid-19 daily, and 1.4 million people have been infected.But an underprepared health system, poverty and a bitter political standoff have worsened Bolivia’s belated encounter with coronavirus. The six intensive care beds at La Portada hospital in La Paz – the seat of government – are all full, said a doctor working there, who asked not to be named. “There’s not enough spaces and the patients die waiting.”Bolivia, one of Latin America’s poorest countries, was among the region’s earliest countries to impose a strict lockdown, on 17 March. Jeanine Áñez – who assumed power last November after the leftist president, Evo Morales, was forced out of office – deployed soldiers in the street and along Bolivia’s high-altitude borders, leaving returning emigrants stranded at desert frontier posts.“This gave us a magnificent result for a while,” said Virgilio Prieto, the national epidemiology chief. “We had great success until the end of April.” Daily new cases remained in the low dozens and clinics, scrambling to secure protective clothing and supplies, could just about cope.Some scientists hypothesised that western Bolivia’s harsh Andean environment helped kill the virus, and that the physiological effects of altitude inoculated locals against the worst effects of Covid-19.“It’s like having taken a preventative pill against this infection,” said Jorge Soliz, a professor at Laval University, Quebec, and co-author of a recent study. “High-altitude regions in Bolivia are 10 times more protected than the regions located closer to sea level,” Soliz argued, pointing to 1,900 cases to date in La Paz compared with 15,000 in Santa Cruz, a lowland city also home to about 1.5 million people.The interim Áñez government “failed to understand the day-to-day reality of many in the country”, said Ximena Velasco, a Bolivian political scientist at the University of Essex. “A lot of low-income families don’t even have the documents necessary to collect the money from the banks.”As in Mexico and Peru, Bolivia’s bustling street markets and cramped commuter minibuses soon became Covid-19 hotspots. “People who are working in markets and transportation appear to be getting the virus at much higher rates and are passing it on to their clients,” agreed Calla Hummel, a professor of political science at the University of Miami.A deeply polarised political situation has also weakened public willingness to obey the lockdown. Áñez has reluctantly agreed to hold a rerun of last November’s cancelled elections, originally scheduled for May, on 6 September – and is running as a candidate herself.Politicians loyal to Morales’s Movement towards Socialism (Mas) have organised demonstrations to demand elections sooner and protest against the lockdown. This may have driven up the infection rate in places like Cochabamba, a highland Mas stronghold, Velasco suggested.On 1 June, parts of Bolivia moved to a “flexible quarantine” with greater freedom for shoppers to circulate, only for the infection rate to accelerate still further to over 1,000 daily cases in late June. Bolivia’s top general, appointed by Áñez, is among those infected.“We’re in this absurd struggle,” said Prieto, who accused the Mas-controlled congress of holding up increases to health spending and emergency funding for crisis-hit regions.“We should all stop looking after our own interests, because the catastrophe that’s occurring in Chile and Peru, where people are dying by the thousands, will happen to us,” he warned. “That’s what frightens me.”“If we keep fighting, the dead and the sick are going to pile up,” he added. “That way, none of us will get to vote.”But critics also accuse Áñez of squandering Bolivia’s hard-won head start. “All the government said was ‘don’t go out,’ but they did nothing to equip the hospitals,” said the health worker at La Portada. “All they have done is steal.”Áñez’s health minister was arrested in May, after it emerged that Bolivia had purchased 179 faulty ventilators from a Spanish company for vastly inflated prices.And while Morales ramped up healthcare spending in his 14 years in power, Bolivia still has just 430 intensive care beds for its 11.5 million inhabitants: barely a third of the level recommended by the World Health Organization.A lack of testing means Bolivia is fighting coronavirus blindfolded, lamented Flores, the volunteer doctor. “Right now we need to pull together and fight for life in Bolivia, and above all forget politics,” he added, “because this affects us all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a9e0a9fab1c368c8856d11ebc06f6b98902ab5/0_62_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cf0d7e6df50a154385e87a323232eee","title":"coronavirus the week explained","story":"Localised spikes in Covid-19 cases ... face mask U-turn in US ahead of Fourth of July celebrations ... and the benefits of watching dystopian moviesWelcome to the last in our series of weekly roundups looking at developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As local spikes in infections continue to crop up in many countries, Amsterdam’s sex workers have had to adopt new measures to prevent infection from Covid-19, and researchers reveal why lovers of apocalyptic movies might have been better prepared than the rest of us when the pandemic struck.Local spikes in Covid-19 casesAs the rest of the UK gets set for a relaxation of lockdown rules this weekend, with pubs, cinemas and hotels reopening, inhabitants of Leicester will face a tightening of restrictions until at least 18 July.Dido Harding, who leads the NHS test and trace system, said the programme had been important in flagging the spike in cases in Leicester, pushing back against suggestions that the authorities had not received enough data from the service.It is not yet clear what is behind the uptick in infections in the city. While it has been noted there have been increasing levels of testing, which might in part explain the rise, similar upticks have not been seen in neighbouring towns.Other countries have also seen sharp localised rises in cases after lockdown restrictions were eased, with Tokyo now seeing new daily cases in triple digits.Meanwhile in Australia, genomic sequencing has suggested a spike in cases in Melbourne could have arisen as a result of a single “super-spreading” event, although there are other possibilities.Volte-face on masksIn the US the continued spread of Covid-19 has led to a U-turn by the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott. Earlier this year, the politician blocked local lawmakers from requiring people to wear masks, but now he has issued an executive order supporting the use of masks, and requiring all Texans to wear a face covering in public spaces in counties with 20 or more cases of coronavirus – although there are some exceptions.Abbott is not the only US politician to change his tune on face masks. Having previously been vocal about not wanting to wear a face mask, President Donald Trump said he was “all for masks” in an interview with Fox Business, saying he looked like the Lone Ranger when he wore one (which may raise a few quizzical eyebrows given that the Lone Ranger wore a mask over his eyes).And as the Fourth of July Independence Day celebrations loom, medical experts in the US have voiced concerns that celebrations could create “super-spreader” events. While many public gatherings have been cancelled, large groups are still expected to get together.“It’s set up a perfect storm,” Joshua Barocas, an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center, said during a briefing by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.“The combination of travel, the combination of reopening – perhaps in some cases too early – and the combination of people not necessarily following some of these preventive guidelines.”Green light for red light in AmsterdamSex workers in the red light district of Amsterdam are allowed to go back to work, but are having to embrace a new normal. They must check that clients do not have symptoms of Covid-19, while disinfection, handwashing and changing of bed sheets have also been ramped up. Some sex workers have added they are also avoiding kissing.This week’s podcast takes a closer look at a figure we have all become familiar with over the past few months: the effective reproduction number, or R.

It’s important to tie this to the lack of social housing and the need to build more.”Peter Matejic, the head of evidence at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Younger people tend to start at the bottom of the property ladder and spending on housing is, to a certain extent, discretionary, so in some ways it is not surprising that younger people tend to have less space.“Some younger people prioritise things other than floor space: they might want to live with friends or in city centres, where properties are smaller and have no outside space.”Dr Jennie Bristow, author of The Sociology of Generations and Baby Boomers and Generational Conflict, said: “The ide is actually one of class and ethnicity, not one of generation. We need to question government policies that have shut down public spaces for young people during lockdown and pushed them back into their homes during lockdown when evidence doesn’t show the necessity of that.”Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “Poor housing is a problem affecting people of all ages. Two million older households, including 530,000 long-term sick and disabled older iniduals, live in homes classed as ‘non-decent’.”Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, added: “A toxic combination of expensive private rents, successive cuts to housing benefit, and a dire shortage of social housing have left us in a total mess.“If the government truly wants to build this country back better, then the case for good-quality social homes has never been more urgent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45555d09f3868d4cae1c3448a5d40f67c895874/0_41_1694_1017/master/1694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e6bd46138bf516a94580c55142629ef","title":"edouard philippe resigns prime minister of france","story":"Macron gambles on reshuffle to reset troubled presidency, with popular PM departingÉdouard Philippe has been replaced as prime minister after seeing France through the coronavirus crisis, as President Emmanuel Macron embarked on a high-stakes reshuffle to “set a new course” for the last two years of his mandate.Macron named Jean Castex, 55, a career civil servant from the centre-right of French politics who coordinated France’s successful exit from lockdown and is widely known as “Monsieur Déconfinement”, as Philippe’s successor. The Elysée Palace said Castex would form the next government.The palace said on Friday morning that Philippe – who dined with Macron on Wednesday and met him again on Thursday, and whose calm, unshowy handling of the pandemic has made him increasingly popular – had submitted his resignation.Sources in the president’s office insisted the discussions between the two men had been warm and friendly, with both agreeing on “the need for a new government to embody the next phase, a new path”, Reuters reported. Macron on Friday praised Philippe’s “outstanding work” in the past three years.The president, whose ambitious economic reforms have been thrown off track by the Covid-19 crisis, had previously promised to “reinvent” himself and his presidency in the wake of the pandemic, in order particularly to be able to better confront the deep recession it is forecast to cause.In an interview with regional newspapers published late on Thursday, Macron said France must prepare for a “very difficult” economic crisis, “so we have to chart a new course … based on economic, social, environmental and cultural reconstruction. Behind this, there will be a new team.”Other top ministers could also be on the way out in the cabinet reshuffle, with the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, who has been strongly criticised over the failure to contain the rioting and looting that marred the “yellow vest” protests of 2018-2019, seen as most likely to go.During the extremes of the crisis it fell to Philippe to deliver the detail of France’s strategy, while Macron painted a bigger picture. During news conferences, the prime minister’s measured and reassuring style won applause as he explained and justified tough lockdown rules and a series of other unpopular measures.Philippe, 49, was appointed in 2017 after Macron’s presidential election victory. At the time he was a member of the centre-right Les Républicains (LR) party, which he subsequently left – but without ever joining the president’s centrist La République en Marche (LREM), fuelling tensions with the Élysée.The announcement came days after the prime minister was re-elected mayor, with a large majority, in his Normandy bastion of Le Havre, to where he is now thought likely to return even if his longer-term ambitions are unclear.The local elections revealed surging support for the Green party, which captured several major French cities, and underlined Macron’s troubles connecting with ordinary people. His LREM movement failed to win a single big city, depriving the president of a local power base ahead of 2022.Jérôme Fourquet of the pollsters Ifop had earlier suggested Macron might be unwise to dump his popular PM. “The difficulty for Macron is that Philippe is not only popular, but difficult to replace and a potential rival,” he said.Replacing Philippe is seen as a significant gamble for Macron, analysts say – but keeping him would have suggested the president was too weak to let go of a popular prime minister, and that LREM lacked the depth of talent for a full cabinet overhaul.Macron and LREM swept to victory in presidential and parliamentary elections in 2017 by blowing up France’s political landscape, exploding the traditional centre-right and centre-left parties. Neither LR nor the Socialist party have recovered.While the present still needs to appeal to left-of-centre voters, Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) is widely tipped to again make it into the second round of the presidential election in 2022. Macron is therefore seen as needing above all to pick up support from rightwing voters.Although Castex, Philippe’s replacement, is on the right of French politics, he was described by one official as a “social Gaullist” – a reference to the more interventionist, socially minded wing of the LR."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16f273e69c518c3c7b5fe2f033a96c54f65abe6/0_326_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56ac5059cc17f5bd397bf3ad7eafab9c","title":"global report horror week for us as coronavirus records tumble","story":"US surpasses 40,000 daily cases four times in a week Brazil nears 1.5 million infections UN warns on mass bankruptcies in Latin AmericaThe past week has seen the United States break its own one-day case record four times, according data compiled by researchers at Johns Hopkins university.In the seven days up to and including 1 July, the country, which has the highest number of cases and deaths worldwide, confirmed over 40,000 cases on four separate days. Wednesday also saw cases rise by more than 50,000 for the first time in the US, with 51,200 confirmed in 24 hours.There are 2,739,230 known infections in the US, and there have been 128,743 deaths.Brazil, second only to the US in terms of number of cases and deaths, has almost 1.5 million confirmed infections, after it added 48,105 new cases on Thursday. Cases there stand at 1,496,858, with deaths at 61,884. Brazil has reported more than 40,000 daily cases at least three times in the past week.Mexico’s coronavirus outbreak also rose by a record 6,741 confirmed cases and 679 deaths on Thursday, putting the country’s death toll at 29,189. Reacting to a spike in virus cases reported in Arizona, the top health official in the neighbouring Mexican state of Sonora has asked Mexico’s federal government to temporarily close the border to non-essential visits from the US.The United Nations has predicted that more than 2.7m businesses could go under and 8.5m jobs could be lost in Latin America due to the coronavirus crisis. The UN’s economic commission for the region said shops, hotels and restaurants, many of which are small- and medium-size businesses, will be hardest hit.Australia’s state of Victoria is still struggling to contain a new outbreak, with 66 additional cases confirmed on Friday. The state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said on Friday there was evidence of a “super spreader” in the Victorian outbreak. She said: “On Tuesday, I received a briefing of a genomic sequencing report that seemed to suggest that there seems to be a single source of infection for many of the cases that have gone across the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne. It appears to be even potentially a super spreader that has caused this upsurge in cases.”In Tokyo, Japan, more 120 new cases were found on Friday, the Nikkei newspaper reported. On Thursday, the metropolis confirmed 107 new cases, the most in two months, but the government – eager to revive a slumping economy – said it was not planning to reimpose the emergency that was lifted on 25 May. Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike, looks set cruise to victory in her bid for re-election on Sunday, buoyed by approval of her handling of the pandemic.Tokyo accounts for nearly 6,400 of Japan’s approximately 19,000 cases.South Korea reported 63 new coronavirus cases as of Thursday, most from domestic infections outside Seoul, triggering the return of tighter social distancing curbs in one city as the spectre of a second wave of the disease worried authorities. For the first time in almost two months, new daily cases from other cities surpassed those from Seoul area. The south-western city of Gwangju has recorded more than 50 cases in the past few days, prompting the suspension of operations at public facilities such as public libraries and museums.North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un meanwhile praised what he described as his country’s “shining success” in holding off the pandemic, according to state-run KCNA news agency on Friday. The head of the totalitarian state spoke at a Workers’ party politburo meeting on Thursday discussing the impact of the virus, AFP reported.Pyongyang has not confirmed a single case of the deadly disease but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and schools, and putting thousands of its people into isolation.Analysts say the North is unlikely to have avoided infections, and that its ramshackle health system could struggle to cope with a major outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/750d688ad098868dc843d30d119bae8edf4b674e/0_75_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b85c677b9dd6ad0ad19a4f86ede2f439","title":"hug bump or wave how to behave as uk covid 19 lockdown eases","story":"Etiquette and behavioural experts on how people should respond as the Covid-19 restrictions are liftedYou’ve been invited round to someone’s house for a barbecue. Then maybe to watch the match, because now, as lockdown eases further, you can be indoors with other people too – as far as you can figure out, from the government guidance, which is over 5,000 words long for England alone.Yes, here: “Indoors in groups of up to two households … you should continue to maintain social distancing.” Hmm, not sure how 2 metres is going to work on their sofa. Or “1 metre-plus”, whatever that looks like.This new lockdown relaxation throws up a whole fresh load of anxiety: about the virus itself, whether you’re going to get it, and whether easing is a good idea or a fast track to a second spike.But also how are you supposed to behave? How do you greet the other household – smile and a wave, elbow bump, or fully-eased hug. What do you bring – your own plates, food, PPE?Jo Bryant, etiquette expert, handily condenses it down to three Cs: consideration, communication and confidence. “If you’re hosting something you have a duty to make sure people can have the option to socially distance. And the option – if they’re not comfortable – to maybe bring drinks or their own cutlery or even food. You need to be very open and loose with the arrangements, allow people to have those options.”Communication is about telling people what to expect, or about how you’ve been at home, “making sure people realise you are aware that people might have different levels of comfort”.She mentions a picture of a wedding that did the rounds, in which people wore different coloured wristbands depending on levels of contact they were comfortable with, from green (“OK with hugs and high fives”) to red (“Hi! I’m keeping my distance”).“Confidence is that very unBritish thing of having the confidence to say what you think,” says Bryant, confidently. “People are putting themselves out of their comfort zone and possibly even breaking the rules because they don’t want to offend.” If you’re not happy about the bottle of ketchup that’s gone through five pairs of hands, don’t have ketchup. Same with distance, stick to what you’re comfortable with, respect what others are.What about that greeting? “Normally I’d give you a hug but I can’t, ha ha ha,” is one suggestion from Bryant. “We are coming out of lockdown, we’ve got a bit of feelgood, approaching it with humour and lightheartedness is a good way of communicating what you’re comfortable with.”Dr Charlotte Hilton, a behavioural psychologist, says that while more freedom is preferable for many, it will also cause increased anxiety about what to do and how to behave. “I guess the recommendation from a psychology point of view is take the point of keeping yourself and other people safe as the starting point.” That might mean wearing a face mask in public, certainly on public transport, hand washing etc.“It has to be a personal decision,” Hilton says. “Some of the difficulty is a lot of these decisions are based on trust in the government, which is notoriously problematic. Particularly when there seems to be this incongruence between science and government, health and economy, it makes the decision-making process more difficult.”Harder still if your decision-making’s a bit wobbly. “After a few drinks in the pub it’s reasonable to think that attention might very well reduce,” says Hilton. “Therefore what we have is much more dangerous behaviour and I think that’s what most people are concerned about.”Professor of health psychology at UCL, Susan Michie, who sits on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), acknowledges the psychological importance of socialising. “It is really important, and one of the mental-health costs of the pandemic has been isolation and loneliness, especially for younger people, especially for younger men … The issue is about how to enable that in a way that the risk level is commensurate with the situation we are in at the moment.”She points to the still relatively high rate of transmission, that a vast majority of it happens indoors, the lack of a fully functioning test, trace and isolate system. And to the fact that alcohol disinhibits behaviour. “So even for those people who have gone out with really good intentions to keep socially distant, wash their hands frequently, not touch other people etc, after two or three drinks we know that will be out the window.”Visiting another household of people you know and trust is one thing, the pub is another. In a situation of risk assessment and risk management, opening pubs is “the top of the hierarchy of riskiness,” she says. “I think it is a recipe for disaster.”Michie is not impressed with the government’s decision-making on easing then, especially when it comes to indoor pubs. It’s too soon. But what about us, how should we behave? She has more faith in us, pointing out how many people locked down before being told to. “I say carry on exercising your good judgment like you did when you locked down before the government asked,” she says. “Avoid pubs despite the government saying it’s fine to go to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/475c4648f8699a075311edf672f8f8a99c11630b/0_240_4754_2853/master/4754.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=20b7311a865e18b5dcb2320bc4554716","title":"is coronavirus really in retreat in the uk","story":"Key questions about Covid-19 answered as lockdowns ease across the four nationsEngland is approaching a significant relaxation of lockdown on Saturday, while in Scotland, outdoor cafes and beer gardens will begin to reopen from Monday. But with rises in infection cropping up around the UK is Covid-19 really on the wane?The short answer is: yes, it is, but not fast enough.New confirmed cases of Covid-19 are falling in the UK, as are deaths, with 576 new cases reported on Thursday compared with 8,719 on 12 April. Experts say that is good news, but they still have concerns.“Although case numbers are lowering in the UK, they are not falling as fast as we would like them to be,” said Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.He said the rate of decline of both new cases and recorded deaths is slowing down. “Maybe we’d expect to see that a little bit as the country opens up what we don’t want is for there to be enough cases hanging around so that they seed a second big outbreak.” Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said there were important differences, with cases in double digits in Wales, confirmed cases in Scotland below ten a day, and very few cases in Northern Ireland.Sridhar also highlighted the different strategies, with Scotland aiming to reach zero new cases, but England apparently setting the bar lower.According to Head: “We just need a few cases here and there for community transmission to start up again … We then might be in the same situation as we were a few weeks back with large numbers of cases and deaths again.”Sridhar said this raised another question: “The challenge is going to be how many times can you actually lock people down? You can imagine if this happens again, I think you will have social unrest.” A key factor will be what happens after lockdown is eased and people mingle in pubs, restaurants and other locations.She said test and trace programmes would be crucial for outbreak control, while Head noted that rapid data-sharing would be needed to help local authorities spot and tackle any outbreaks – something that has been a matter of controversy in the Leicester outbreak.It is unlikely the disease will be stamped out, at least in the short term. While experts say a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford is the best hope for a Covid-19 vaccine this year, the timelines remain uncertain and, even if it is released, experts have cautioned it may not offer complete protection.“We need a very effective vaccine that needs to be available everywhere in the world – essentially, that is the end game,” Head said. “That is not going to happen at any point soon. That is more than one year ahead, probably two or three years ahead minimum, I reckon, before we can say we have completely got rid of Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7556520cac47db2118d29891761dbe66ec89f7c/0_113_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=781d066f96a4b8dc02d307ba1cb83442","title":"us included on englands covid 19 red list for travellers","story":"Quarantine rules will not be lifted for arrivals from US due to its high number of infectionsThe US will be on a “red list” of high-risk countries that people in England are advised not to visit for non-essential reasons because of its continued high level of coronavirus cases, the government has confirmed.Travel restrictions will be relaxed in England for more than 50 countries including nearly all EU countries, British territories such as Bermuda and Gibraltar, and Australia and New Zealand.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the quarantine rules would not be lifted next week for travellers arriving from the US or Greece.“The US, from a very early stage, banned flights from the UK and from Europe so there isn’t a reciprocal arrangement in place in any case there,” he said. “They have got very high numbers of infections, which is why they are not on the list today.”Shapps told BBC Breakfast the countries people would be able to travel to England from without facing quarantine restrictions would be split into two groups.Ministers have not guaranteed reciprocal arrangements with all the included nations, meaning some may require English holidaymakers to go into quarantine at the beginning of their trip. Shapps said some countries – such as New Zealand – on the green list might impose restrictions on English travellers, while England would allow New Zealanders to enter the country without restriction.“I take New Zealand as a good example. They do have restrictions when you arrive, but we thought it was right to include them because people may want to come here from New Zealand and that’s no particular threat to our hard-won gains.“But on the middle countries, those ones are places where we have reciprocal arrangements in place that if you go there or if you come here, the arrangements are the same both ways round. In other words, you do not have to quarantine.”Asked about the decision taken by Boris Johnson’s father to visit his holiday home in Greece, Shapps said it was “up to the inidual” to decide what was essential travel, but that Stanley Johnson would have to self-isolate on his return to England for 14 days.The government has failed to convince the devolved administrations to sign off on the overall plan, with the Department for Transport stating that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will “set out their own approach”.On BBC Scotland’s Reporting Scotland programme, Scotland’s justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, criticised the UK government’s approach to air bridges, saying devolved governments had not been sufficiently consulted.Yousaf said the prevalence point – the estimated proportion of the population currently infectious – of the virus in Scotland was 0.037 while in England it was “five times higher”.“There’s some countries that may not be as high-risk as England or a lower risk than England but, clearly, coming into Scotland, if they are a higher risk – France, Italy, Spain all have a higher prevalence point than Scotland does – then clearly that’s going to have a different potential impact in Scotland than it does in England,” he added.According to the DfT, the Joint Biosecurity Centre, in consultation with Public Health England and the chief medical officer, considered factors for each destination, including the prevalence of coronavirus, the number of new cases and the potential trajectory of the disease. Passengers will still be required to provide contact information on arrival in England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about itFrom this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

The 2021 game is set for Atlanta’s Truist Park, home to the Braves since 2017.Because of the pandemic, opening day had already been delayed from 26 March to 23 or 24 July.“Once it became clear we were unable to hold this year’s All-Star festivities, we wanted to award the Dodgers with the next available All-Star Game, which is 2022,” baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.Dodger Stadium has since May served as the city’s largest coronavirus testing site, where up to 6,000 people can be tested daily.This will be the first time since 1945 that no game will be held. Travel restrictions because of World War II kept the game scheduled for Boston’s Fenway Park and any player selections from taking place that year. It was pushed back to the next season.A UK government scientific adviser has criticised the decision by the prime minister’s father to travel to his Greek villa in apparent breach of Foreign Office guidance, write Nazia Parveen in Manchester and Helena Smith in Athens.Boris Johnson has refused to condemn his father, Stanley, for flying to Greece, despite current advice for British nationals to avoid all but essential international travel.Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists to government on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, said the incident could undermine the public’s trust in government guidelines.Reicher, previously reacted with disdain to Johnson’s defence of his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, after his notorious visit to his parents’ home in Barnard Castle during the height of lockdown.Of the recent episode involving the prime ministers’s father, Reicher said evidence had shown that trust is more important for compliance at this stage than it was during the lockdown.“Erosion of trust undermines people’s willingness to use the test, trace and isolate system and in particular to give their information to the authorities,” he added.The New Mexico national guard and tribal police are preparing to enforce a weekend curfew on the Navajo nation, as the sprawling reservation tries to contain a coronavirus outbreak that has so far killed more than 370 people, the Associated Press reports.The curfew, which starts at 8pm on Friday and expires at 5am on Monday, is the first of three consecutive weekend lockdowns on the territory, that s parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the tribal president, Jonathan Nez, said. He warned that enforcement will be strict and include checkpoints in communities across the nation.“The majority of Navajo residents comply with the weekend lockdowns, but there are a handful of residents who do not comply and continue to travel off the Nation and put themselves and others at risk of contracting the coronavirus,” Nez said in a statement. The vast reservation has been trying to stop a major virus outbreak for weeks. The tribe reported 56 new cases on Thursday and two additional deaths. That brought the total to 371 deaths and nearly 7,700 confirmed cases.The US reported a daily global record of more than 55,000 new coronavirus cases on Thursday as infections rose in the vast majority of states and America’s top public health expert spoke of a “very disturbing week”, write Joanna Walters and Victoria Bekiempis in New York for the  US.Hospitals in some of the new hotspots in the US south and west put themselves on a crisis footing and face becoming overwhelmed. Florida reported almost 10,000 new cases in the past 24 hours and that state along with Texas, Arizona and California together made up almost half of the total of new infections.The daily US tally stood at 55,274 new cases late on Thursday, topping the previous single-day record of 54,771 set by Brazil on 19 June and exceeding single-day tallies from any European country at the height of the outbreak there.“What we’ve seen is a very disturbing week,” Anthony Fauci, a top federal health expert on the White House coronavirus taskforce and longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a livestream with the American Medical Association.The surge this month, after a steady improvement in California and a continued improvement in the previous center of the pandemic, New York, has been blamed in part on Americans not covering their faces in public nor following other social distancing guidance or rules as states swiftly lifted their lockdowns.Fauci warned that if people did not start complying, “we’re going to be in some serious difficulty”.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Saudi Arabia has passed 200,000, according to the latest update from the country’s health ministry, weeks ahead of the annual hajj pilgrimage, which has been drastically cut back because of the pandemic.The Gulf’s worst-hit country has now 201,801 confirmed infections including 4,193 new cases on Friday alone. There have been 1,802 deaths, while more than 140,000 of those infected subsequently recovered.Amid tight restrictions to rein in the pandemic, the kingdom has said it would only allow around 1,000 worshippers already present in the kingdom to take part in the annual hajj pilgrimage later this month. In 2019, it attracted over 2.5 million pilgrims from around the world.Saudi Arabia has seen an increase in both confirmed coronavirus infections and deaths from the Covid-19 illness the virus can cause since easing movement restrictions in late May.It has yet to restore international air links.The mayor of Florida’s biggest city has imposed an indefinite nightly curfew after the number of coronavirus cases in the state jumped again on Friday, according to Reuters. The Miami-Dade county mayor, Carlos Gimenez, announced an indefinite nightly curfew from 10 pm to 6am as the 4 July holiday weekend began and halted the reopenings of venues, such as casinos and theaters that had been set for Friday.  “Let’s celebrate Independence Day by respecting one another’s right to life, liberty and happiness,” Gimenez said in a video on Friday, citing the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The move came after Florida recorded 9,488 new cases on Friday, according to the state health department, on top of more than 10,000 new cases the previous day.  Thursday’s figure marked Florida’s largest daily spike so far and put it on a level that exceeded single-day tallies from any European country at the height of the outbreak there. Pakistan’s foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, has announced he has tested positive for the coronavirus, as the number of confirmed cases in the country passed 220,000 on Friday. He said he felt a ’slight fever,” immediately quarantined at home and later tested positive, according the Associated Press. Qureshi is the senior most government official to contract the virus. Pakistan’s infection rate has been steadily climbing since the prime minister, Imran Khan, eased restrictions saying the country’s fragile economy would collapse under a strict lockdown and the poorest would suffer the most.Khan has gone on national television to ask Pakistanis to wear masks and social distance, but the vast majority largely have ignored the precautions. Confirmed infections reached 221,896 on Friday and more than 4,500 deaths. Pakistan has pulled back on testing to around 20,000 tests a day from a high of more than 32,000. Four MPs have died of Covid-19, one from the federal legislature and three provincial parliamentarians.Spain will reopen its borders to visitors from 12 non-EU countries from Saturday, the country’s official state bulletin has announced, according to Xinhua. Australia, Canada, South Korea, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, New Zealand, Rwanda, Thailand, Tunisia, Serbia and Uruguay, were selected from an initial list of 15 agreed by the European Union, China’s official news agency reported.Spain reopened its borders to countries of the EU and the Schengen passport-free area on 21 June. Coronavirus restrictions in South Africa are posing an existential problem for one of the country’s youngest Christian sects, with a ban on drinking effectively banning their idiosyncratic ceremony for communion.When the country began easing its coronavirus lockdown in May, it allowed religious worshippers to gather in groups of up to 50, but maintained a ban on people assembling to drink alcohol, Reuters reports.That’s a problem for the “Gabola” church — the name means ‘drinking’ in the local Tswana language — for whom a tipple is an integral part of their religious worship.Founded just two years ago, the church tried to hold its usual meetings in local bars, called shebeens, to praise God while downing whisky, but they soon got arrested, said its leader and self-styled pope, Tsietsi Makiti, 55.“They can arrest us until Jesus comes back,” said Makiti, wearing a bishop’s mitre with a miniature bottle of spirits hanging off it. But he added they had nevertheless been moving services from place to place to avoid a run-in with the authorities.On Sunday worshippers met in a rubbish-strewn field in Evaton, south of Johannesburg. As the service started, clergy blessed beer bottles in prayer. “At Gabola church you (bring)... the liquor of your choice... and the pastor will bless the liquor so that it will not be poisonous to your body,” Makiti said.Wearing flowing black robes and coloured scarves, Makiti and five clergymen sat before a table strewn with empty bottles of alcohol. Makiti’s sermon included such proclamations as: “We are a church that will remake the world.”“People call me a drunkard,” said one worshipper, Nthabiseng Kotope, 38, who said she joined the church in March. “I agree with them. I do God’s work while drinking.”Apart from the ban on alcohol, the congregants observe all other coronavirus rules, including the limit of 50 people, the spacing out of chairs and use of hand sanitisers.The UK is in talks to join a European Union plan to secure supplies of potential coronavirus vaccines, in a test of the cooperation required to tackle international emergencies after Brexit, the Financial Times reported on Friday, according to Reuters.  London is assessing whether the advantages of the European bloc’s bargaining power to strike deals with international drugs companies outweigh the broader political desire to sever ties with Brussels, the report said, citing UK officials. Life in Russia is unlikely to return to normal until next February at the earliest, the country’s health minister has said, according to Reuters.Mikhail Murashko told the Interfax news agency that 3,500 people in Russia were still receiving treatment via artificial lung ventilators, which he said was a “serious figure”. He added that millions would have died had preventative measures not been taken. Some restrictions have already been eased, with restaurants, gyms and domestic travel all permitted within social distancing guidelines and certain parameters. But with thousands of new cases still being reported every day, and a death toll approaching 10,000, some measures remain in force, including a ban on international flights, extended on Thursday until August.“What is normal life? It’s going to concerts, taking flights, fully fledged work and travel. In my view, it’s unlikely that this will happen before February,” Murashko said, without elaborating on his choice of month.  Russia has reported 667,883 cases of the novel coronavirus - the world’s third-highest tally - but just 9,859 deaths, far lower than death tolls in other countries, which has prompted some scepticism. Several dozen prostitutes armed with an inflatable sex doll staged a protest in Berlin on Friday against coronavirus restrictions they say are preventing them from making a living, AFP reports. The protesters gathered outside the Bundesrat upper house of parliament with red umbrellas and placards bearing slogans such as “Let us work,” “Open the brothels now” and “Our sector is being driven underground”. Prostitution is legal and regulated in Germany, with sex workers entitled to employment contracts and social security benefits. But sex work has been banned since mid-March as part of efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus.The Federal Association for Erotic and Sex Services said this was “incomprehensible in view of the developments in other sectors”. “Hairdressers, massage parlours, beauty salons … fitness studios, tattoo shops, saunas, restaurants and hotels have been allowed to reopen,” it said in a statement, but sex workers “seem to have been forgotten by politicians”. Brothels have been allowed to reopen in neighbouring countries including Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, the association pointed out. “Prostitution facilities are subject to particularly strict regulations and are obliged to offer their sex workers a safe, hygienic working environment,” it said.A junior minister in the Ghanaian government resigned on Friday after failing to self-isolate after testing positive for coronavirus, the presidency said, according to AFP.The president, Nana Akufo-Addo, accepted Carlos Kingsley Ahenkorah’s resignation “with immediate effect”, according to a statement from Akufo-Addo’s office.“This follows the admission by the deputy minister of his breach of the Covid-19 protocols, when, as a person certified to be positive of the virus, he visited a registration centre in his constituency before the period of self-isolation was complete,” it said.The presidency said that the Ahenkorah, who was deputy minister of trade and industry, ought to have led by example rather than violate self-isolation protocols.The embattled minister told AFP that as an asymptomatic patient he was not a major threat to other people. “I have Covid-19, but I’m asymptomatic. There is nothing shameful in catching covid. I never got in the midst of people at the registration centre. I spoke to a few people at the centre and left,” Ahenkorah added.The authorities in Ghana have introduced a raft of measures, including self-isolation, lockdown, mask-wearing and social distancing to curb the spread of the virus. The disease has so far infected more than 18,000 people and claimed 117 lives in the west African nation. Hong Kong’s new security law has prompted a sharp uptick in inquiries from families looking to relocate to Canada, but Ottawa’s strict Covid-19 border control measures are making it nearly impossible to get in.Even before the law took effect this week, refugee claims from Hong Kong in the first three months of 2020 nearly tripled to 25 compared with nine in all of 2019 and just two in all of 2018, Canadian government data shows. Claims from all countries have plunged since March amid Covid-19 closures. Beijing imposed the legislation on Hong Kong this week despite protests from Hong Kongers and Western nations, setting China’s freest city and a major financial hub on a more authoritarian track. Canada was a preferred destination for Hong Kongers who fled the island city ahead of the British handover to China in 1997, and some 300,000 people in Hong Kong hold Canadian passports. Most who came in the 1990s have left and interest in relocating from Hong Kong to Canada has been tepid in recent years. But in the days since China imposed the security law, Vancouver immigration lawyer Richard Kurland has found himself consulting with people by phone, email and Zoom on how to get from Hong Kong into Canada. “This week is the game-changing week with the new security law,” said Kurland. “Now families are taking things seriously.” Moving to Canada will not be as easy as it was in the ‘90s. A programme that allowed wealthy foreigners to buy admission to Canada was scrapped in 2014. And the border is currently closed until at least the end of July due to the coronavirus pandemic, with only citizens, permanent residents and others deemed essential allowed in. “Until the travel restrictions are lifted from Covid, I can’t imagine how someone would manage to even board a flight at this point,” said Toronto immigration lawyer Chantal Desloges.

WHO special envoy Dr David Nabarro has advised caution on overseas travel. Photograph: Vassil DonevEPAWorld Health Organisation special envoy Dr David Nabarro has advised caution on overseas travel amid the continued Covid-19 pandemic, saying “if in doubt, don’t go”.He also said that teachers’ unions and the Irish Government are right to debate the balance of risk of a reopening of schools in September.This was “a tricky question”, he said. Dr Nabarro said he favoured a “gentle” return to schools, which meant a return “bit by bit”.“There is a real challenge here, what degree of risk is appropriate or acceptable in that setting?”Spike in casesDr Nabarro said he had been told that children are capable of understanding the need to practise social distancing if it is explained to them by parents and teachers. But schools needed to be prepared to close if there was a spike in cases.When asked to explain what he meant by a “gentle” opening, he said he meant being ready to change tack “if things don’t turn out as hoped”.“You may find that if you do it bit by bit it works well. I imagine you will do it very well, you will do it together.”On the issue of face masks, Dr Nabarro said that airline staff, pubrestaurant staff, security staff and cleaners should all be wearing masks. He was glad that masks are to be mandatory on public transport in the State, and added that they should also be mandatory in shops and cafes.Dr Nabarro said he understood decisions being made for economic reasons, but said such moves should only be made on a health basis. “In the end having a system that keeps us all safe is most important.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4295787.1593797367!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda%C3%AD to start checking pubs to ensure covid 19 guidelines being followed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOnly pubs serving hot meals, costing a minimum of €9, can reopen and customers can stay for a maximum of 105 minutes.

Our intention in this latest phase was to conduct a large number of spot-checks of licensed premises. “However, it now appears that just a few days after their introduction some licensed premises and their customers are ignoring the public health guidelines. By doing so, they are putting themselves and everyone they then come into contact with at risk of getting Covid-19. This is not acceptable and we are now expanding our planned checks.”Only pubs serving hot meals, costing a minimum of €9, can reopen and customers can stay for a maximum of 105 minutes. Social distancing must be maintained meaning no seats at the bar and, in some cases, the erection of plastic screens between tables. On July 20th pubs can reopen without serving a hot meal, assuming the Covid-19 infections numbers remain on the right track.SuppressedEarlier the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) reporte that another two people diagnosed with Covid-19 have died. This brings to the total number of deaths related to the disease in the Republic.Nphet also reported a further nine new cases of the disease, bringing the total number of confirmed cases here to 25,498 .Dr Ronan Glynn, Acting Chief Medical Officer said “Ireland’s 14 day incidence of Covid-19 is now less than 3 cases per 100,000. This is amongst the lowest in Europe and demonstrates that the disease remains suppressed in our communities. The key to maintaining this status is responsible inidual behaviours and avoiding any complacency.”“HIQA’s report on mortality today demonstrates that we have comprehensively recorded deaths relating to Covid-19 in Ireland by following the recommended WHO approach.“We have consistently recorded and published data on all deaths where a person had Covid-19 or was suspected to have Covid-19. This reporting gives us a robust understanding of the impact of the disease in Ireland and continues to inform our response.”Dr Glynn was referring to a report wihch said Ireland’s official death toll from Covid-19 may have been overstated, according to a new report that says there was a 13 per cent increase in deaths during the pandemic.Between 1,100 and 1,200 more deaths than would have been expected on historical patterns occurred between March 11th and June 16th, according to the report by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa).However, this is substantially lower than the 1,709 Covid-19 deaths officially reported toNPHET over this period.Data on mortality are usually gleaned from death registration records but because of a three-month lag in this process, Hiqa’s estimate of excess deaths, and other recent estimates during the pandemic, are based on data from the Rip.ie website.Hiqa found the officially-reported Coivd-19 deaths “likely overestimates” the true burden of excess deaths caused by the virus.This could be due to the inclusion within official figures of people who were infected with coronavirus at the time of death but whose cause of death may have been “predominantly” due to other factors, it suggests.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4295665.1593792947!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a how close are we to having a covid 19 vaccine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A model of Covid-19, known as coronavirus, is seen ahead  during a US Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the plan to research, manufacture and distribute a coronavirus vaccine. Photograph: Saul Loeb-PoolGetty ImagesThe remarkable global effort to produce a range of Covid-19 vaccines in parallel with developing new treatments – many of which are adapting proven medications for other diseases – is gathering pace. The scale of scientific endeavour is unprecedented, not just in terms of finding a new vaccine, but in the level of co-operation between scientists in quickly sharing results, data and critical genetic details indications of variations in the form of what is known as SARS-CoV-2. Then there is verification of the work of others, enabling promising work to push on. That is the reassuring bit. It heightens the chances of success on both vaccine and antiviral fronts. A rough assessment of timings on potential vaccines would suggest early optimism needs to be tempered and early 2021 is the most likely time one will become available to some.When might we have a vaccine?The realists among the ranks of virologists, immunologists and vaccine developers, who are familiar with all too frequent experience of failure, would say all this is very much on the optimistic side. The leading immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill of Trinity College Dublin always refers to a horse racing metaphor you may be leading the Grand National and have just one fence to clear, and fall at the last hurdle.The world also has to face up to the fact that there may never be an effective virus. But he is quick to add that the ability to contain the novel virus through a combination of therapies is very likely – as was the case with AIDS. Likewise, there are already treatments emerging that will act as a bridge to getting a vaccine in place.The one discordant note undermining this tremendous team play is wealthy countries buying up treatments, as seen with the US recently buying up all the next three months’ projected production of the drug remdesivir from US manufacturer Gilead – it cuts recovery times, though it is not yet clear if it improves survival rates.There remains the risk such big players aligned to powerful pharma companies will do the same when a vaccine emerges, and national interests will dominate over need to give it to those requiring it most. That being said, and acknowledging the case for doing things differently, there are other strategies being born out of desperation – in the form of 10 million cases and 500,000 fatalities and no indication of peak – that are likely to counter that threat.What is the emerging picture on leading vaccine candidates?There are more than 145 candidate vaccines in development, with 17 in human trials. Some have been shown to generate a strong immune response in animals.Those conducting vaccine trials are “chasing the disease around the world” notably in Brazil and the US. Places where there are high levels of Covid-19 are the best to test efficacy and safety.The extent of that research is likely to mean a range of vaccines of differing type and effectiveness will emerge – the first to come on stream might not be the magic bullet hoped for. But given the whole world will need protection a variety of vaccines from different sources is not such a bad thing.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson has indicated, for example, its vaccine appeared so promising in preclinical studies they were able to push up the start for testing in healthy volunteers to later this month. The vaccine uses a common-cold virus to deliver a coronavirus antigen into cells to stimulate the immune system to fight off an infection. This type of “vector” using weakened virus is already proven effective and safe in 65,000 humans.Its chief scientific officer Dr Paul Stoffels outlined to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this week how the clinical trial process is being accelerated in the case of Covid-19 with elements run in parallel, while drug companies are already scaling up manufacture of the vaccine to have it ready in the quickest possible time - much different to traditional approaches of the past. If one element fails, all others are then stopped, he confirmed. The vaccine is already in production in the US and Europe with a view to 1 billion doses being available early next year.Meanwhile the US government is spending billions of dollars in supporting the five best candidates, in the hope of having the best one available in the shortest possible time.Other vaccines continue to make significant progress towards clearing each stage of a robust trials processOxford University is regarded as making most progress, and “offers the best chance of having something protective against the virus as we go into winter”, MPs have been told.It is being tested in Brazil and South Africa, where the case numbers are high. Astra Zeneca, the company partnering with Oxford, is to start a trial with 30,000 people in the US. European countries are lining up behind this project.BioNTech’s vaccine being developed with Pfizer in Germany has confirmed positive trial results, generating immune defences in participants that were stronger than those of the average recovered Covid-19 patient. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is faster than traditional methods.Moderna’s mRNA vaccine trial in the US showed participants developed similar levels of immunity to recovered coronavirus patients, with only minor side effects. Rather than using pathogens to induce an immune response, mRNA vaccines use genetic material that carries instructions for cells to produce proteins that fight disease. However, no marketable mRNA vaccine has been produced to date.China is using a vaccine developed with CanSino Biologics on army personnel though little is known about the type of vaccine involved and extent of deployment.All these factors confirm great progress yet there is no clarity on timelines, which underlines the importance of having treatments in the meantime. Uncertainty over the extent to which having the disease confers immunity and protection against re-infection is an added complication pointing to the acute need for Covid medicationstherapies.So what are the promising treatments?Fortunately, the process of finding new treatments is quicker with lower regulatory hurdles to clear, though it has to be said a widely available medication approved for routine use has not materialised yet.Numerous trials are in progress with prompt endorsement of effectiveness or rejection. There has been too much haste on occasion, as in the case of hydroxychloroquine, though some trials are continuing using this anti-malaria drug and, bizarrely, some recent results are more positive.Early indications on dexamethasone – a cheap steroid –suggest it reduced deaths by one-third in patients on a ventilator. A run on dexamethasone ensued as physicians quickly made it part of their standard of care for the sickest patients. This drug, however, looks to be only effective in patients already in a critical state.Remdesivir reduces the duration of infection in hospitalised patients but not mortality. It does not come cheap, costing $2,340 per treatment in the US.Other drugs such as daclatasvir, used to treat Hepatitis C imatinib to treat leukaemia and favipiravir to treat influenza are showing promise. “Cocktails” of these drugs could be deployed as they are no longer patented, meaning they would be easily and cheaply made available.A long-established therapy using “convalescent plasma”, in this instance made from antibodies from people who have had Covid-19, continues to show promise, and it can be manufactured in a laboratory.Likewise, T cells may be sufficient to control infection in the absence of antibodies. T cell responses have been detected in most Covid-19 patients, and first-in-human vaccine trials have reported potent T cell activation. It is possible that T cells’ memory of Sars-CoV-2 may last longer than antibodies.There is also significant work being done on monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies and can be isolated and manufactured in large quantities to treat patients.When it comes to vaccines, was there adequate preparedness for a pandemic?For scientists and doctors who have had to wrestle with the rapid spread of Covid-19 across the world, it is a game of constant catch-up. The insidious nature of the novel virus compounds their difficulties. The picture is incomplete. That said, on a daily basis revealing details emerge so the medical response is being constantly perfected.The bottom line as of now, however, is a safe and effective vaccine remains the best way to achieve herd immunity on a global scale. The lessons for future preparedness are clear.Immunologist Sir John Bell of Oxford University has criticised the lack of pandemic planning in the UK and particularly the absence of manufacturing capacity for vaccines. It is, however, a global problem that will have to be addressed through sustained funding over many years.This pandemic was “not a one-off” that would not recur for centuries, he told a House of Commons committee.That warning was echoed by Dr Stoffels who outlined the need to have a range of vaccines in place, especially in relation to coronaviruses like Covid-19 and flu, before outbreaks lead to a difficult-to-control pandemic.

Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4295340.1593765837!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wage subsidy could continue until end of year says paschal donohoe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe (right) alongside Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath during a press conference outside Government Buildings in Dublin on Thursday. Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said that the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme will not end abruptly and suggested it could last until the end of the year.The objective of the July stimulus will be to take action in 2020 that is successful in “keeping jobs that we have and allowing new jobs to be created,” he added.The wage subsidy scheme is now responsible for keeping more than 400,000 people in a job, he said.On top of this, more than 213,000 people signed on to the live register in June and a further 438,933 people were receiving the pandemic unemployment payment, CSO data shows. The total receiving income assistance from the State to just in excess of 1 million, with some overlap between the schemes.“What I can confirm now is that it will not come to an abrupt end because were that to happen, that itself creates the risk of jobs being lost,” Mr Donohoe said.“In relation to the pandemic unemployment payment, the last government outlined that across the month of August we would begin to make changes in relation to that payment, as our economy reopens.“We’ve in fact made one such payment this week in relation to those who would have been on part time work in the past.”When asked if the scheme would be extended to the end of year, Mr Donohoe said that was a decision that needed to be taken by the Government. “As I said, I and the last government, brought in these payments, the value of them and the value of the wage subsidy scheme in particular is recognised very strongly by the Government. I’ll be working with the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and with my new colleague Michael McGrath to come up with the right plan now for those schemes.”As a former minister for tourism, Mr Donohoe said that he was very aware of the strains and pressures the sector is under. He said he would keep the option of a VAT reduction under review when making decisions for the July stimulus and could look at the matter again in the Budget in October.A cut in the 13.5 per cent VAT rate is being examined by the new Government. However, a reduction in the VAT rate of 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent, as was introduced in 2011 by the then Fine Gael-Labour government, is seen unlikely and any move this year will not be as “drastic”, Government sources have said.Mr Donohoe said that job creation and job retention had to be prioritised over other options. “We need to get the balance right and implement a stimulus plan that makes a difference to the keeping of jobs.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4295338.1593769216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dara murphy leaves eu job after just seven months","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy has left his job at the European Commission seven months after he took up the post. File Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsFormer Cork Fine Gael North Central TD, Dara Murphy’s job at the European Commission has come to an end just seven months after he took up the post.Mr Murphy moved into the position in the cabinet of the Bulgarian European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel in December after resigning from his position in the Dáil under the shadow of an expenses scandal.The Fine Gael politician had been representing Cork North-Central while being based primarily in Brussels, where he worked in a senior position in the European People’s Party while having the lowest voting turnout record in the Dáil.Mr Murphy abruptly stopped working in the Commissioner’s cabinet in mid-June after just seven months in the post, and he has moved into another position within the Commission where he will work on research and innovation until his notice period ends in September.“By mutual agreement Dara Murphy has left my Cabinet. I am very grateful for his contribution from the beginning of the mandate,” Ms Gabriel told The . “I wish Dara all the best for the future.”Mr Murphy told The  he had left his post due to a “new opportunity” but would not say what this was.Ms Gabriel had previously taken criticism because of the scandal over Mr Murphy’s poor attendance and expense claims in the Dáil broke that just as he took up his new position in her cabinet, leading to negative coverage in the press in her native Bulgaria. A former European Affairs minister, Mr Murphy became a well-regarded figure in Brussels in the wake of Brexit as EU counterparts found him personable and valued his ability to explain Ireland’s unique dilemmas.After being dropped from his ministerial post by then-taoiseach Leo Varadkar, this clout helped him get an appointment as campaign director for the European People’s Party (EPP) in Brussels, the right-leaning political grouping that includes Fine Gael and is the largest bloc in the European Parliament. Sources in the EPP say that Mr Murphy did not distinguish himself during his time as campaign director, which he performed simultaneously to his role as a TD. Ms Gabriel, a former EPP vice-president, appointed Mr Murphy to her cabinet just as the expenses scandal broke in Dublin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Zheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4295481.1593777762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"liberal values in russia swept aside in putin s power grab","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA supporter of LGBT rights takes part in an opposition protest in  St Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday. Photograph: Anatoly MaltsevEPAWhen Russian LGBT activist Alexey Nazarov voted against President Vladimir Putin’s constitutional overhaul this week he was not just rejecting a redrafting that would allow the president to extend his more than 20-year long rule.He was also opposing a slew of social initiatives – including a ban on his right to marry – from being enshrined in Russia’s fundamental laws.While Putin’s move to reset his presidential terms and potentially remain in office until he is 83 has dominated criticism of the new constitution, that is just one of more than 200 amendments that will tighten the Kremlin’s control over Russian society and bolster its efforts to suppress liberal values.The new constitution specifies that marriage can only be between a man and a woman, affirms the importance of God and mandates the teaching of patriotism to children. It also calls for Russia to resist efforts to “falsify” the country’s history and designates Russian the “language of the state-forming ethnic group” in a state boasting dozens of minority languages.“The amendments will both make Putin irremovable and reinforce discrimination,” said Nazarov, who is gay. “These amendments represent the destruction of the constitutional system of Russia.”The referendum, which Putin arranged in a bid to lend a veneer of public support to changes he had already passed into law, is the latest move by the 67-year-old to promote nationalist, conservative and traditionalist policies and legislate against what he has described as “obsolete ... liberal ideas” prevalent in western countries.“We are not just going to vote on legal amendments,” Putin said in an appeal to all citizens on Tuesday, the day before polls closed. “We are voting for the country in which we want to live.”“The country ... that we would like to pass on to our children and grandchildren,” he added.Pop-up stationsThe slate of amendments was supported by 77.9 per cent of voters on a turnout of 68 per cent, according to government figures, after months of heavy support from state-run media, and a week of voting using pop-up polling stations in car boots and on park benches.Citizens were offered the chance to win vouchers, washing machines or even an apartment in a raffle if they voted, and state-run companies leaned heavily on employees to participate, in a bid to ensure turnout was high. Independent monitoring organisations noted widespread irregularities and reports of ballot-stuffing.Human rights groups have warned that many of the amendments will increase censorship and reduce freedom of speech, restrict the rights of minorities and citizens whose lifestyles are deemed in breach of “traditional family values” promoted by Putin.Last weekend Russian police arrested more than 30 people who took part in inidual protests against the detention of a pro-LGBT and feminism activist accused of publishing pornographic photographs.One amendment endorsed this week enshrines the supremacy of Russian courts over international tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights, hitherto the last hope for citizens seeking to overturn Moscow’s judicial decisions. Another increases the government’s power to dictate how people get access to the internet.Tanya Lokshina, Moscow-based associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia ision, said the amendment banning all but heterosexual marriages “continues the trajectory of homophobic discrimination the Kremlin has stoked since the 2013 anti-gay ‘propaganda’ law”, referring to legislation that banned actions deemed to “promote” homosexuality.An advert produced by a pro-Kremlin group urging support for the amendments showed an orphan’s sadness at being adopted by a gay couple, prompting an elderly woman to spit in disgust.“Is this the Russia you will choose?” says a voiceover. “Decide the future of the country.”Another amendment that codifies the upholding of “traditional values” raises “ample grounds for concern that this could be used to further counter women’s rights, including by thwarting efforts to adopt a law against domestic violence”, Lokshina said.Popular supportEleanor Bindman, senior lecturer at Manchester politan University, said the traditionalist thrust was partly aimed at whipping up popular support for the plebiscite, which only offered voters the ability to either support or oppose all the amendments at once.The referendum was first scheduled for April but was postponed as the coronavirus pandemic swept across Russia, and at one point made the country the world’s second-most affected. The vote began last week despite the country recording more than 6,000 new Covid-19 infections daily.Planning for the overhaul coincided with a fall in Putin’s popularity ratings to record lows, amid sustained economic gloom. That drove a sense of urgency inside the Kremlin to ram through the amendment to ensure the potential continuation of his regime past 2024, when he was obliged to step down under the previous constitution.“This was not a referendum, it was like a military operation,” said Alexey Sergeyev, a LGBT campaigner from St Petersburg. “But it has also activated LGBT people. Many of my friends who never went to the polls went to vote ... in the future, there will be much more politicisation.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Israel\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Sergio FloresBloombergTexas governor Greg Abbott has issued an order requiring face masks be worn in public in the state’s hardest-hit regions, the latest attempt to snuff the coronavirus outbreak that continues to spread in the US south and west.The executive order from Mr Abbott, which applies to counties with 20 or more positive tests, was accompanied by a measure giving local governments the authority to limit public gatherings to 10 people statewide.“We need to refocus on slowing the spread but this time we want to do it without closing down Texas again,” Mr Abbott said on Thursday.The governor’s order came as the number of new cases nationwide increased by more than 50,000 for the second day in a row, led by Florida, which tallied Thursday’s sharpest uptick. The state reported 10,109 new cases over 24 hours - a record that was up from 6,605 recorded on Wednesday.According to the Covid Tracking Project, the US saw 52,815 new cases, just short of the 52,982 record increase set on Wednesday. In addition to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina saw record increases on Thursday.The Texas face mask mandate marks a sharp reversal for Mr Abbott, who aggressively reopened the state’s economy in May. The Texas governor has been forced into other lockdown U-turns in recent days, ordering bars to close and banning elective surgeries at hospitals in the state’s biggest cities to free up beds for coronavirus patients.Texas recorded 7,915 new infections on Thursday, just under the record 8,076 tallied on Wednesday.President Donald Trump insisted authorities were “putting out the fires”, despite alarms raised earlier this week by Anthony Fauci, the US’s leading infectious disease expert, that the new outbreak risked spinning out of control.“Some areas that were hard-hit are now doing very well,” Mr Trump said at a White House news conference intended to tout a sharp drop in the unemployment rate. “Some were doing very well and we thought they may be gone and they flare up and we’re putting out the fires.”‘Deadly wrong’Joe Biden, Mr Trump’s presumptive Democratic challenger, used a set-piece live address to attack the president for not mentioning the 50,000 new cases and failing to provide a co-ordinated response to reopening.“We’ve seen cases spiking around the country some businesses are closing down again,” Mr Biden said from his home in Delaware. “Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved. He’s deadly wrong – on both fronts.”Mr Biden contrasted the US response to that of its peers, including the EU, which has banned Americans from travelling to Europe owing to the rise in US cases. “We’re already at more than 128,000 dead – and that number keeps climbing,” he said. “Other countries have figured out how to get the virus under control, reopen their economies and put their people back to work.”Florida has been established as one of the new US hotspots for Covid-19, but the state government has been reluctant to further roll back its reopening plans, having already ordered bars across the state to close last week.“We’re not going back, closing things,” Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor and a Trump ally, said on Wednesday, suggesting that the spread was more a result of younger people failing to comply with health guidelines than the reopening of businesses.Ahead of the July 4th weekend, which has the potential to be a so-called superspreader event, some regions in Florida have issued their own guidelines and restrictions to residents.Cities in the Florida Keys decided on Wednesday to cancel their fireworks displays, while festivities in places such as Orlando are still expected to go ahead.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"first known named pet uk revealed cat called mite lived hampshire","story":"While now we are surrounded by cats with all manner of names, from Tiddles to Fluffy, once upon a time the mouser was viewed as property, not a pet. However, a historian has now revealed that feline friends were viewed as part of the family as early as the 13th century, as the first ever British pet to have a name was a cat named Mite.The cat lived in Beaulieu Abbey in Hampshire around the year 1270 and has been discovered, along with his name, in an illuminated manuscript from the time.Ancient Egyptians were the first to have named their domesticated animals Abuwtiyuw, the guard dog to a Pharaoh, is thought to have been named in 2280 BC.Historian Jacky Colliss Harvey, author of The Animal’s Companion: People and their Pets, a 26,000-Year-Old Love Story, has worked with FirstVet to uncover what is believed to be the first British domesticated cat with a name.Ms Collis Harvey said that the life expectancy of ancient cats increased as people began to view them as pets.She explained: “Most cats living around Mite’s era would have had the same life-expectancy as street cats today - that is, about five to seven years. But as with today, what would have made the difference was an owner’s tender care.Some notable examples of long-living cats include the writer Samuel Johnson’s cat, Hodge, who is now immortalised by a statue outside Dr Johnson’s London home. Records show that this 18th- century cat lived long enough to have lost his teeth (corroborated by the fact that Johnson famously bought him oysters to eat when he could no longer chew).”Later, other famous pets were named and loved by their owners in Britain. ‘Math’ was the beloved dog of King Richard II (1367-1400). Math is said to have deserted Richard II for his rival, Henry Bolingbroke - who would eventually go on to become King Henry IV.‘Nosewise’, ‘Smylefeste’, ‘Trynket’, ‘Nameless’, ‘Clenche’, ‘Holdfast’, and ‘Crab’ were names mentioned in a 15th-century book on hunting, written by Edward, 2nd Duke of York between 1406 and 1413. ‘Crab’ was later used as the name of a dog in Shakespeare\u0027s 16th-century play, The Two Gentlemen of Verona.‘Terri’ is the name of a small dog depicted in brass on the tomb of Sir John Cassey and his wife Alice in Deerhurst, Gloucestershire, around the year 1400.David Prien, CEO and co-founder of FirstVet, said: “800 years on from Mite, naturally much has changed in regards to pet care. But the humanising aspect of naming an animal remains just as profound. While the age of the internet has resulted in vast documentation of the lives of pets, these rare but poignant historical examples of names demonstrate that, as now, animals were valued companions to humans.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sainsburys asda agree review use coconuts picked monkey slaves","story":"Carrie Symonds has thrown her weight behind the campaign to end the use of \u0027monkey slaves\u0027 in coconut farming after the issue was brought to light by the .Sainsbury\u0027s has now agreed to review all of its coconut products and Asda has vowed to drop the brands after a host of other supermarkets including Waitrose promised to remove them from sale on Wednesday.An investigation by Peta Asia found that Thai coconut harvesters, including some of the biggest brands from the country which were stocked in the UK\u0027s leading supermarkets, used monkeys on leads to climb up trees to harvest the fruit.The animals are seen chained to dirty tyres with no shelter from heavy rain, and they have their front teeth removed so they cannot fight back.When they are not forced to pick coconuts, they are kept in cramped conditions with no ability to perform their usual behaviours.Monkeys are favoured for the job as they are able to pick up to 1,000 coconuts a day, and it is thought that a human can pick about 80.It said it also discovered monkey schools, where the animals were trained to pick fruit, as well as ride bikes or play basketball for the entertainment of tourists.After The  reported on Waitrose, Morrisons and Ocado dropping the products, Ms Symonds commented: Glad Waitrose, Co-op, Boots \u0026amp Ocado have vowed not to sell products that use monkey labour, while Morrisons has already removed these from its stores.Time for ALL supermarkets to do the same.The Prime Minister\u0027s fiancée called the conditions the monkeys face appalling.Environment minister Lord Goldsmith also supported the campaign, sharing it on Twitter.An Asda spokesperson said: “We expect our suppliers to uphold the highest production standards at all times and we will not tolerate any forms of animal abuse in our supply chain.

initiative highlight black figures world","story":"Famed for masterpieces such as Botticelli’s Birth of Venus, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence is launching an initiative to raise the profile of hitherto neglected figures in its huge collection – black courtiers, kings and servants.As interest in the Black Lives Matter movements grows, the art gallery wants to highlight the paintings in its collection which feature black characters.The initiative, called Black Presence, will be launched on Saturday with a live Tik Tok tour and a Facebook music concert featuring Gabin Dabirè, a singer and instrumentalist from Burkina Faso in West Africa. It is an attempt to broaden interest away from the overwhelmingly white faces that appear in masterpieces by the likes of Caravaggio, Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian.Black figures that appear in the Uffizi’s collection include kings from Abyssinia and Ethiopia, in portraits commissioned by Cosimo I de Medici in the 16th century as part of a series of paintings representing the most illustrious figures of the time.In the Adoration of the Magi by Albrecht Dürer, one of the three kings bears unmistakably African features, while in a painting of Perseus freeing Andromeda, by Piero di Cosimo (below), a musician with black skin and curly hair occupies the foreground.In a painting entitled Madonna ‘Domenica delle Cascine’, la Cecca di Pratolino e Pietro Moro, by the Flemish artist Justus Sustermans, there is a trio of black figures.These are just some of the artworks that feature people of African origin, the Uffizi said.The stories of the black figures will be recounted on Tik Tok by Justin Randolph Thompson, the director and co-founder of Black History Month Florence, a festival held each year in the Tuscan city.“The Uffizi is not some ivory tower of art in fact its collections address the major issues of our contemporary world,” said Eike Schmidt, the German director of the gallery, who has embraced social media platforms such as Tik Tok as a way of reaching wider audiences.“Through art, the museum can tell the great story of the past while also bringing the artworks to life in the present, because its masterpieces speak a universal language that helps us not only to comprehend their own era better, but also to understand the future that we wish to build”.By exploring paintings which feature black figures, the gallery hopes to illustrate Africans’ “social and cultural presence in people’s mindset in Renaissance Europe, testifying to the extremely fertile exchanges that already existed between these two areas of the planet back then.”Designed and built by Giorgio Vasari in the 16th century, the Palazzo degli Uffizi was originally home to Florence’s guilds, officials and magistrates – \u0027uffizi\u0027 in Italian means \u0027offices\u0027.It was eventually used to house the growing art collection of the Medici family, which was bequeathed to the city in 1743.More from NewsMore

without a clear plan for support from the government, Scottish Labour has warned.With the coronavirus pandemic bringing the live music, theatre and art industries to a standstill and leaving thousands of workers without job security, the party urged the Scottish government to provide a “creative arts recovery package”.Scottish Labour’s culture spokesperson Claire Baker said: “The pressures on our creative sector are mounting every day, and the support that the Scottish Government should have put in place weeks ago has not materialised.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“These businesses and venues were the first to close when the lockdown began, and while most staff were furloughed, with no end in sight, redundancies are being announced.”She continued: “We know the recovery from Covid-19 for these industries will be particularly difficult, and they cannot afford to lose out on the vital revenue they need from ticket sales and bookings over the next few months.The too-brief life and joyful work of pop artist Keith HaringSimon Armitage: ‘The events of this year are all I can think about’The filmed version of Hamilton enhances the show’s charisma“We need a Scotland-specific creative arts recovery package, with wide ranging avenues of support, or the arts sector will not recover. The lack of action is risking the future of performance venues, and the Scottish Government must now take serious and immediate action.”In April, it was announced that Edinburgh’s five international festivals, including the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, would not be taking place due to the pandemic. The August arts festival is attended by 4.4 million people each year.Across the UK, workers in the creative industries have called on the government to provide guidance on how arts buildings can reopen with social distancing measures in place without losing huge amounts of money.The Royal Albert Hall CEO Craig Hassall warned that without financial support from the UK government, the 150-year-old venue could go bust in the next year, leaving hundreds of people without jobs.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are among the stars who have today urged Londoners to bid on sections of Sir Peter Blake’s pop artwork Our Fans to raise money for Help the Hungry.Last Friday, The Independent announced that the giant mural — draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge during its 2017 renovation — would be cut into 100 sections and auctioned off.The work, which echoes Sir Peter’s famous 1967 artwork for The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, is his largest piece, the size of 38 London buses. Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort. She said: “Double honour — to be a face in Peter Blake’s awesome collage for the Mandarin and to be a tiny part of helping Help the Hungry. It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community. The people have been really welcoming of me into their community.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just feel bad about all the people in hospitality who have lost their jobs, so I feel quite lucky to be back here.” Different business will operate different rules. There may be booking systems and, as fewer people are allowed in, people may face queues.Social distancing limits set at two metres were dropped to one metre with mitigations in place after the hospitality sector said it needed this flexibility to make businesses viable.  Child maintenance worker Chloe Sayers, 19, who was drinking a honey liquor, said the Sunflower was “a second home” and that she “felt very safe”.“The staff couldn’t be better,” she said. “It’s great.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has to be table service or via an app, and you must order a substantial meal.However, if the pub has outdoor seating you do not have to order food.American Bar regular Patrick Wilson said he was happy to be back at his favourite bar and after months of no pub time was looking forward to “a Sunday session”. “Tins of Guinness just aren’t the same,” he said.The owner of both The Sunflower and the American Bar, Pedro Donald, said time would tell if the businesses could stay open. “It’s great to be back again,” he said. “The initial few weeks will tell us whether the business is viable with the new and understandable rules and regulations. “We stayed in touch with a lot of our regulars on social media, but it is great to see them in person again.“Hopefully this new situation will be short-lived.” Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 related deaths in Northern Ireland has fallen for the eighth week in a row.According to the latest figures from the Northern Ireland Research and Statistics Agency (NIRSA), up to 26 June there has been a total of 826 Covid-19-related deaths.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Youth unemployment could top one million by the end of the year — highlighting the scale of the jobs crisis facing an entire generation of young people, a new report warns.The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank estimated that an extra 620,000 people aged between 18 and 24 will be jobless by the end of the year, on top of the 410,000 already unemployed.This will be the highest number of young people unemployed on record, surpassing the levels seen in the 2008-9 and 1990s recessions, said the report.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis level of youth unemployment should be a major cause for concern, according to the IPPR, as being out of work at an early age can cause serious “scarring effects” on people’s life chances including lower wages, increased risk of further unemployment and worse health into later life.A £3bn government intervention was needed to ensure everyone under the age of 25 is in education, training, apprenticeship or a job, said the report.Harry Quilter-Pinner, IPPR senior research fellow, said: “We face an unemployment crisis in the UK. Our analysis suggests youth unemployment could more than double by the end of the year. This would be a huge waste of talent and potential. It doesn’t have to be like this.Unemployment set to surge to 3.5 million, businesses forecastThink tank report calls for biggest job creation drive in peacetimeWarning of ‘Thatcher levels’ of unemployment“That’s why we are calling on the government to step in to guarantee all young people either a funded place in education, an apprenticeship or a job.“This will require the state to support businesses to take on young people, just as it has supported them to retain adults through the furlough scheme.”A government spokesperson said: “We are doing everything we can to protect our economy and ensure there are options for young people, with the Opportunity Guarantee announced earlier this week ensuring every young person has a chance of an apprenticeship or in-work placement.“Alongside our package of support for business, our nationwide network of Work Coaches are already matching jobseekers to new roles as we get Britain back working again.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Just six per cent said they were “strongly opposed” to the measure, and a further 7 per cent said they “somewhat oppose” while 20 per cent of those polled said they “neither support nor oppose” the introduction of the policy. Among those who voted for Boris Johnson’s Conservatives at December’s general election, 56 per cent said they either strongly or somewhat support the government considering the policy to reduce the working week.Those surveyed were asked to respond to the statement: “Some people have recently suggested that a four-day working week could help us recover from the impact of Covid-19 by sharing work more equally across the economy, with no reduction in pay for workers except the highest earners. “Supporters say it could improve wellbeing, boost the economy and reduce sick days, while some businesses argue their wage bill may increase whilst paying current wages for shorter hours. To what extent would you support or oppose the government exploring the introduction of a four-day working week?”Will Stronge, the director of research for Autonomy, who commissioned the research, said: “The research demonstrated that a shorter working week is beneficial to the environment, to our wellbeing and to staff performances. It’s a multi-idend policy.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A fairer, post-Covid economy that benefits workers is the right thing to do, and shorter working hours with no reduction in pay should be part of that,” he added.In a letter seen by The Independent and sent to the chancellor last month, MPs and activists said shorter working time has been used “throughout history as a way of responding to economic crises”, as they urged the Treasury to explore the policy. “They were used as a way of reducing unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s, which led to the normalisation of the eight-hour day and the 40-hour week,” they added. “One of the biggest impacts would be better mental health and wellbeing across the board, with more time available for socialising, family and community.”Joe Ryle, a campaigner with the 4 Day Week campaign and former Labour adviser, said: “The four-day week is an idea that is gaining momentum across the world right now because people are reimagining a better future for themselves post-Covid-19.“A four-day working week is a no-brainer.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Hong Kongers have said they feel torn between the life-changing decision to leave their homes and take up the UK’s citizenship offer - or staying to fight for their freedom. Boris Johnson\u0027s government has offered almost three million residents eligible for British National Overseas (BNO) passports the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship after China imposed a new security law on the former UK colony. But leaving behind homes, jobs and loved ones to move almost 6,000 miles across the world is not an easy decision to make, said some of those considering the move.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther Hong Kongers currently abroad said they were fearful of returning home after the law - which makes it easier to punish protesters and reduces the territory\u0027s autonomy from Beijing - came into effect on Tuesday.Theodore*, who did not want to give his real name for security reasons, is currently studying in Europe. Live: China warns UK not to ‘interfere’ in Hong KongSenate sends China sanctions over Hong Kong crackdown to Trump\u0027s deskHong Kong’s protesters ‘prepare for long fight’ as China tightens gripThe spirit of protest in Hong Kong is still alive – but they need helpWho in Hong Kong is eligible for UK residency?His parents had already urged him not to return home after he became a vocal critic of the Beijing government last year, even appearing on local television. With the passing of the new security law, they are even more fearful for his safety. “It’s soul-crushing to think I can’t return to Hong Kong,” he told The Independent. “I can\u0027t imagine not speaking out for Hong Kong, or against the very obvious threat the Chinese government poses to the entire world,” he said. “Even if I settled in the UK and went back to Hong Kong occasionally, I could still be arrested. And the idea of not going back for years, if not decades, is soul-crushing.” The detail of the new law means that if he discussed the threat China poses to the UK while in Britain that would also be a crime in Hong Kong. Theodore says he has “complicated feelings” towards the British move to extend citizenship rights to Hong Kongers since the UK government “took away our rights to live in the UK back in the 1970s-80s with a string of nationality laws.

He said he would like to continue his studies in the UK – but he was born in 1997 and his parents aren’t from Hong Kong so he doesn’t qualify for a BNO passport.  His older sister, on the other hand, is eligible - but has a four-year-old child and doesn’t want to move across the world to an unfamiliar place. Ben said many Hong Kongers now fear China, or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), will “send them to concentration camps in the future”. “I’m afraid but I’m still fighting for the freedom to the last minute,” he said. “Most of the young people in Hong Kong believe we can win this war. I have friends who have BNOs but Hong Kong is our home.” For now, he said, they will stay and fight while preparing for the “worst-case scenario”. Sam* has campaigned for greater rights for BNO holders for years. While he welcomed the UK’s offer, he never envisioned making such a big move during retirement. He said he would like to rent - and maybe one day even own - a house in a big city like Liverpool or Birmingham once he and his family “learn the UK way of life”. “It’s very sad about the changes in Hong Kong,” he told The Independent. “I was born in Hong Kong, I live in Hong Kong, I married and have a child in Hong Kong and I’m feeling so sad that I have to make a decision during my retirement – it\u0027s a big move. “We really fear the CCP and we are very afraid that Hong Kong will be a second version of Xinjiang and will be made to be an open prison “We see the Hong Kong police will be turned into something like the police state. We are very fearful walking on the streets now because they can stop and search anyone.” Sam said if you ask people in Hong Kong for their “status” now “I think they will say they are Hong Kongers”. He added many will stay and fight to see “who will be stronger, who will die first – China or Hong Kong”, but if he moves to the UK he doesn’t plan on looking back. “Hong Kong is our roots,” said Eunice, who has just graduated from Imperial College London with a master\u0027s degree in science.  She moved to the UK for boarding school as a child but her once-frequent trips home to see her parents have become less and less as she is fearful of returning. “It’s very difficult to know that you are not able at the moment to go back to your home,” she said. “The younger generation do get targeted so maybe that is something I have to be very careful about.” Eunice, who hopes to stay in the UK and contribute back to society, said she noticed the changes in Hong Kong when she last visited more than a year ago. “Just, like, casually going out on a Sunday to do some shopping in the tube station you see armed police standing there – that\u0027s something shocking for me,” she said. She added her parents have BNO passports but they are waiting for further details to be released by the Home Office before making such a big decision. Johnny Patterson, director of the Hong Kong Watch campaign group, said the security law has “really terrified people”. “I had one message from a friend who works in a civil society group who said their daughter had been having nightmares about them getting arrested so she stepped back from working for the organisation,” he told The Independent.  “It’s a very sobering, serious change that we are seeing in Hong Kong.  “It’s not yet clear how many people will move to the UK – I think it will depend on what happens in terms of how China applies the law. There probably is no going back to the Hong Kong we knew before but what the new Hong Kong looks like is an unknown.” John Hu, founder of John Hu Migration Consulting, based in Hong Kong, said English-speaking countries are the top choices for Hong Kongers looking to move – and that he has received 10 calls today, some from existing clients, applying to move to the UK.“I think the Hong Kongers are more determined now,” he told The Independent. “They will see they will have less freedom of speech and democracy and values of Hong Kong people.”*Some names have been changed to protect identities.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Coronavirus lockdowns are lifting around the world, raising concerns that it could trigger a new wave of infections.Some countries that experienced a significant drop in new Covid-19 cases in April and May are now beginning to experience an uptick in confirmed daily cases.The concerning trend can be seen in several countries throughout the Middle East, most notably in Iran where new cases briefly dropped below 1,000 in early May but have now more than doubled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIran was one of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak of the deadly virus, with close to 200,000 total cases recorded.Looking at a smoothed seven-day rolling average for new daily cases, Iran\u0027s second wave came almost exactly one month after the first wave.The data suggests that Iran may have already reached the peak of its second wave and is now on the decline.Other countries in the region appear to be experiencing a more gradual second wave, with official figures from Israel revealing that new coronavirus cases have been rising consistently for the past three weeks.Israel\u0027s second wave remains a long way off the peak of the first wave, and the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East.In Saudi Arabia, new cases are rising at record rates despite briefly appearing to peak in late May.The false peak means the latest surge of new cases could be counted as a continuation of the first wave, rather than a new second wave.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The replacement comes as Mr Macron is reshuffling the government to focus on restarting the French economy after months of lockdown due to coronavirus.Mr Castex, 55, served for two years as the second-highest ranking official in the Elysee Palace during Nicolas Sarkozy’s presidency.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe was described by an Elysee official as a senior civil servant hailing from the centre-right of French politics whose experience in local politics will help Mr Macron connect with provincial France. The move by Mr Macron to refashion his centrist government comes after voters punished him and his party En Marche! in nationwide municipal elections held from March to June, revealing a surge in support for the Green party.Macron becomes latest world leader to question China over coronavirusIt was a political gamble for Mr Macron to replace the prime minister, who is more popular with the public than himself. Political analysts say Mr Philippe has shown steadfast loyalty during waves of unrest and could emerge as a presidential rival in 2022.Everything you need to know about visiting France this summerFrance’s support for Libya’s Haftar is finally coming home to roostFrance opens up to tourism with a 1986 ‘slow travel’ hitFrance looks to increase litter fines amid PPE wasteBut keeping Mr Philippe in office would have been problematic for Mr Macron as it would have suggested his young party lacked the depth to allow for a complete cabinet overhaul.In an interview given to several local newspapers, before Mr Philippe’s resignation, Mr Macron praised the now-former prime minister for his “outstanding work” in the past three years.He said he is seeking a “new path” to rebuild France for the two remaining years of his term.“The return from summer holidays will be difficult, we must get ready,” he was quoted as saying in regional newspapers.Mr Philippe said during his campaigning in Le Havre: “If he the president thinks someone else would be more useful as prime minister, I will in complete loyalty respect his choice.”Additional reporting by agenciesNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think actually – I’ve had some very good conversations – with friends and colleagues around the EU. I’m a bit more optimistic than Michel [Barnier] is there.”He added: “I just think there’s a good agreement to be reached, but obviouslywe can’t then we will have the very good option also of an Australian-style arrangement.”Boris Johnsons economic investment response to the coronavirus crisis has been criticised by Tory former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine.Lord Heseltine told BBC Radio s Today programme: #What we have is a twin crisis, which is the crisis of the corona epidemic# and it is over with the crisis of Brexit.#It is a crisis of unprecedented scale and it is going to get worse.#So, the question really is how is the Government responding, how should it respond #And I have to say I was deeply disappointed in the speech the Prime Minister made in Dudley.#It was simply the sort of speech with a lot of proposals which were remarkably similar to what all governments have done faced with rising unemployment.#They announce packets of money in housing and transport and repairs for the health service# but they lack the one thing that is essential, and that is the local enthusiasm, energy and enterprise.#Image: AFPA number of destinations favoured by Brits have been left off the quarantine-free air bridge list today.Hotspots not on the list include:Britain and Brussels will face off over who has the final say in the proposed £bn merger between Virgin Media and O.It comes as the UKs Competition and Markets Authorityis expected to ask the EU’s competition watchdog to hand over control of the review. It will argue that the merger only affects UK customers, the Financial Times reports.The CMA told the newspaper: “This important merger will only impact consumers in the UK and since any review will likely conclude after the transition period, it is only right for the CMA to request it back now.”Its understood, however, that the EU may want control of the process because Brussels has historically overseen telecoms deals.The Government has this afternoon announced the countries on its air bridge list.There are a number of countries now not subject to the -day quarantine.The list includes:More on that last blog post.OneWeb # which has its headquarters in London # will complete the construction of a constellation of Low Earth orbit satellites providing enhanced broadband and other services to countries around the world.Business Secretary Alok Sharma has spoken about the deal.He said: #This deal underlines the scale of Britains ambitions on the global stage.#Our access to a global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect millions of people worldwide to broadband, many for the first time, and the deal presents the opportunity to further develop our strong advanced manufacturing base right here in the UK.#In a statement, OneWeb # which has its manufacturing base in Florida # said the deal would enable the company to emerge from bankruptcy with a #robust foundation# to continue its commercial operations.The th hour bid to acquire a stake in the firm was reportedly signed off last week by Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said the deal will #allow the UK to explore other potential strategic opportunities working with our international allies# after Brexit. The Government has taken a major stake in the failed satellite company OneWeb, in a drive to develop a sovereign UK space capability.The UK is part of a consortium with Indias Bharti Global, which won a bidding war for the company, which went bankrupt earlier this year while trying to develop a space network to deliver broadband.Ministers hope it will compensate for the loss of access to the EUs Galileo programme in the wake of Brexit.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK and mobile operator Bharti are each investing  million US dollars , with Britain acquiring a #signicant equity stake# in the company.Officials said the deal would put the UK at the #cutting-edge of the latest advances in space technology#.The England and Wales Cricket Board has approved an increase in overseas players in domestic cricket from next year and will now allow two per side in four-day and -over cricket.Teams are currently allowed to field only one imported player, though foreign-born players with British passports and those on Kolpak registrations have not counted towards the allocation.The effects of Brexit mean Kolpak deals will be terminated at the end of the postponed  campaign meaning those players # as well as those who have had deals cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic # will now have a greater chance to earning deals.The move was recommended by the performance cricket committee, chaired by Sir Andrew Strauss.Products from Japan or South Korea would be stamped “Made in Britain”, under Boris Johnson’s plan to save the domestic car industry after Brexit.The proposal is an attempt to prevent punishing tarfs driving away the likes of Nissan and Toyota.One trade expert has said the plans will sound “ridiculous” to voters who were promised huge benefits from leaving the EU.Speaking of Nissans threat to leave the UK after Brexit, Alan Winters, professor of economics told The Independent: “We know that the Japanese are wondering whether they would stay around.“Brexit is going to be bad news for jobs in lots of dimensions. In this one dimension, the British proposal would help to head off some of those losses.”And Dr Peter Holmes, reader in economics, said: “What the UK government is seeking from the EU on rules of origin is unprecedented.“To the average Brexit supporter this approach may sound ridiculous and not part of any deal they voted for, but without it Japanese car plants risk facing  per cent tarfs on cars made in the UKthey use engines, gearboxes or other components made in Japan.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel made her first public appearance wearing a mask today # after dismissing accusations of hypocrisy earlier this week for not wearing one.Merkel entered the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, wearing a black mask marked with EU.de, a website dedicated to Germanys six-month presidency of the European Union which started on July .Merkel, whose government has made wearing a mask compulsory in some public places, was asked by a journalist at a news conference on Monday why she had never been seen wearing a mask in public.The chancellor responded that she did not need to wear a mask when she was observing social distancing rules, but did so when she could not, for example during private shopping trips when she was not in the public eye.Image: APThe European Commission has given conditional approval for the use of antiviral remdesivir to treat coronavirus – days after the U.S. bought up almost all stocks.The EU executive said the drug, produced by Gilead Sciences Inc, was the first medicine authorised in the EU for treating Covid- following a “rolling review” which began in April.The Commission is in negotiations with Gilead to obtain doses for the  EU countries.However, that may prove dficult after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it had secured all of Gileads projected production for July and  per cent of that for August and September.Tomorrow is Super Saturday in England as the lockdown eases.So which businesses are allowed to reopen European Union foreign ministers will discuss Hong Kong at their next meeting, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said today, after China unveiled a national security law, which the West says threatens freedoms in the city.Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier she feared that Hong Kongs autonomy was being #eroded#.She said Germany will raise issues such as human rights with China during its presidency of the EU.Image: APGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing for a quick agreement on a recovery fund aimed at pulling the European Union out of the coronavirus recession, arguing that every day counts.Germany took over the rotating EU presidency for six months on Wednesday. That gives it a key role in cajoling others in the -nation bloc to compromise on the recovery fund and the EU budget for the next seven years.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has invited Merkel and top EU officials to a meeting on July  to take stock of progress and prepare the negotiations.#The road is stony and a lot of good will and readiness to compromise from all sides will be required to achieve our aim,# Merkel told the upper house of Germanys parliament in a speech setting out her priorities for the EU presidency. #In view of the current economic development, time is pressing and every day counts.#Image: EPAThe plunge in euro zone business activity caused by lockdowns imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus eased sharply last month as more businesses reopened and people ventured out, a survey showed on Friday.Around  million people have been infected by the virus globally, but as the number of daily reported cases has fallen across much of Europe, governments have loosened restrictions on peoples movement.To support ravaged economies the European Central Bank expanded its pandemic-related bond purchases to a total of . trillion euros last month.More now from the PMs interview with LBC this morning.Askedthe Government was being disrespectful of EU rules, Mr Johnson replied: #No, not remotely.#However, he says it would be wrong for the UK to continue to comply with EU laws or #hand over our amazing fish stocks#, adding: #Were not going to do that#.#We now need to make sure that we get a good deal,# he said. #Im a bit more optimistic than Michelis there.#There is a good agreement to be reached, but obviouslywe cant, then we will have the very good option also of an Australian-style arrangement.#Australia does not have a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU.

But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If we were the only pub in eight miles that is open, that’s just asking for trouble.”The Plough Inn in Ratby, another village just outside the lockdown, will also ask customers to bring photo ID with their address to gain entry.In a notice on Facebook, they added: “We ask those who live within the Lockdown Boundary to please not attempt to gain entry.“We are sorry we are having to exclude you, but I am sure you will understand, we have to take the safety of our customers and staff seriously, we are taking this measure purely on safety grounds.”“These are strange times,” it added.Police across the country have said they are bracing themselves for “two weeks of New Year’s Eves” to hit when doors open on July .And for some, the decision to remain in lockdown has taken away the pressure of Super Saturday.Tony Marriott, the landlord at the Nags Head, also in Glenfield, said that in some ways, he was glad to stay in lockdown for another two weeks.He said: “It’s given us a bit more time to figure out how people will fit in.“We were apprehensive anyway opening on Saturday.“I feel for the pubs opening – there are going to be a lot of people trying to get into those places.“We just want everybody to be safe.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Using your skill and ingenuity, you have to predict which town or city will be the next to be put on special measures .⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesTowns and cities where people haven’t been behaving themselves.Right now, it’s Leicester in the sin bin. They are a very community-minded bunch and couldn’t resist going out to meet each other. So there’s a Covid spike.Experts reckon the next place to cop it will be Doncaster. They’re a friendly bunch there, too. But I reckon there’s a decent outside chance it will be Bournemouth or Brighton. Or maybe Cardf is worth a flutter.The people of Leicester are confused, as well they might be. They don’t know what they’re allowed to do any more. I don’t blame them.But it will be as nothing to the confusion across the country which comes as a result of Super Saturday.July  is the day the Government has said we can shake off our chains and go out and get wrecked. Or something.Have you got any plans for the weekend  Going to a rave  Or just down the pub to breathe over as many people as you possibly can. Here’s my big worry. That Super Saturday will be followed, five days later, by Terrible Thursday.Five days is the average time it takes for the Covid virus to make itself known to the person it has taken up home in. That slightly ticklish cough. Bit of a temperature. Uh-oh.Restaurants, pubs, campsites and children’s playgrounds will all be open for business from Saturday. Oh, and hairdressers. Remember them Obviously, it is right that the UK must emerge from what the Prime Minister called its long hibernation. But I think these things need to be done gradually, rather than all at once.Frankly, I would have started with our schools. Teachers have proved themselves to be just about the only people in the country who can’t work from home. Most kids have enjoyed painfully few virtual lessons, and reopening schools first would have shown where our priorities lie.But it’s not a good idea, in my book, to release the bats all in one go. Many people will have taken from Boris’s announcement last week that, after July , lockdown is effectively over.And some of the Government’s guidelines make it easy to be confused.  The two-metre social-distancing rule has been relaxed to something called “one metre-plus”. I haven’t a clue what dference that makes.And the whole thing is very dficult to monitor. The police say they don’t know how they will deal with it.The virus has been dying out because, by and large, we have been abiding by lockdown. The summer sun has helped, too. The best thing we can do to keep that curve plummeting is to do much as we have been doing so far.The last thing we need this summer is a sudden second spike.If you use that phrase you’re supposedly signalling you’re vulnerable. And need attention. But what about the ones who really did have pasta and liked it  And aren’t at all messed up but just want to share their evening meal experiences in a very real sense  They are strange creatures, the young.THE country is on course for a wonderful, “V-shaped economic recovery”, according to a bloke at the Bank of England.I don’t know what that means. A month or so back, the Bank of England was saying the economy was in ruins for ever, mass unemployment, bankruptcies – giant mutant crabs marching across the country eating our children. Or something.Never believe an economist. You’d be better off talking to Mystic Meg.THE latest historical figure to be attacked by people with no sense of history is Charles Dickens.A former Green Party councillor, Ian Driver, sprayed graffiti on a museum to the author, with the inevitable word “racist”.I supposewe were to ban Dickens, it would bring cheer to millions of schoolkids.Great Expectations can be a bit of a grind to get through when you are young.But this tearing down of history has to stop.Was Dickens racist  Yup. He lived in Victorian Britain. Almost everybody had views which wouldn’t go down very well today.But he was also a brilliant writer and a philanthropist.We are all better than our worst acts.The Chinese authorities are reportedly sterilising these people now – taking a leaf out of Hitler’s book. Yet this outrage raises barely a flicker of publicity. Even other Muslim countries don’t complain too much. That’s because they don’t want to upset the third worst country in the world . And what does the United Nations say  Nothing. Just like it says nothing about China’s occupation of Tibet, or its bullying of democracy campaigners in Hong Kong.A GOOD plan from the Prime Minister. Boris wants to turn the deserted shops in our high streets into homes for people.If he did that, he’d cure half of our housing problem very quickly. Without paving over the entire country for new estates.Many of our high streets are decaying. People now go to out-of-town shopping centres for an afternoon of misery with the missus.But here’s another idea for BoJo. Offices.Lockdown proved we don’t need offices like we used to. They were invented because we needed places to shuffle paper around. But we don’t use paper any more. And during lockdown people worked perfectly well from home.Imagine how many homes we could create by changing offices into flats.And how much rent businesses would save.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Burn  loot a couple cities, and the politicians and corporations will start to do whatever the f*** you want them to do, its pretty amazing.“Imagineincels banded together and did the same exact ѕhit these BLM people are doing ”Another forum member, whose avatar picture is of Ricardo López – a crazed stalker who sent a letter bomb to singer Bjork before killing himself – suggested organising a worldwide incel movement.He wrote: “We’d need to heavily organise this. The incel problem is an international one. A group of incels, in America for example, could band together and riot.“We could organise it so that incels from dferent countries met up...“Incels from England banded together. Incels from Poland banded together. Incels from the Philippines banded together. So on and so on.“Maybe we could impact the worldeach of those groups of incels rioted in their national country and also attacked embassies. It would devastate all countries.“Some countries would be more lenient and accept our demands while some other countries would probably kill the protestors.“At leastsome countries cave in to our demands, that can still be considered a win.”While is not clear what their twisted demands would be another recent thread of the forum discussed “banning women from cities.”The opening comment read: “Cities should just be toll areas directly connecting freeways with skyscrapers.There should be walls around it and no clubs, no mcdonalds or any of that. So women cant congregate in wh**e arenas...”Other posters suggest sending women to war zones in the Middle East to be used as “cannon fodder.”Another said: “They should be slaves. Thats it.”The community gained worldwide attention when British-born student Elliot Rodger, , murdered six people at the University of Calornia in .The warped motive behind the killings were exposed in a chilling YouTube video and in a “massacre manesto” in which he mentioned girls such as model Monette Moio, , who he called an evil bitch for spurning his advances.Rodgers’ actions and the sick words in his manesto are believed to have inspired at least three other mass murders in North America,The most infamous of these was carried out by Alek Minassian, ,who killed  people when he ploughing through pedestrians in a rented van in Toronto, Canada.In a disturbing Facebook post, before the massacre, Minassian said an “Incel Rebellion has begun” while also praising Rodgers as a “Supreme Gentlemen.”The term also extends to people who believe they have no possibility of finding a partner to get love, validation or acceptance from.The community is predominately male and the forum incels.me suggests women have readily available access to sex as do gay men.However, the movement was initially started by a Canadian woman known as Alana.Some people who identy as incels blame attractive men and women for their perceived state - a belief that has lead to several mass killings in the US.The group dub people who are able to have normal sexual relationships as normies and have isions within their community as to when someone can be classied as an incel.He has gained notoriety in the community for posing as a male model on dating sites and then filming his disturbing encounters with women.This comes as a suspected incel accidentally blew his own hand off while making an explosive device that may have been designed to kill hot cheerleaders, according to reports last month,Cole Carini, , of Richlands, arrived at the Clinch Valley Medical Center with a missing hand and shrapnel wounds on his neck and throat.Several fingers on his other hand were also ripped off, which he told medics was caused by a lawnmower accident. But a cop who arrived at the hospital to interview Carini became suspicious after learning of his previous convictions for explosives. Police obtained a warrant to search Carinis home and alerted the FBI.They discovered drops of blood leading from a minivan outside the residence to a bedroom on the second floor of the house.  According to an arrest affidavit, investigators found a piece of human skin and a skin colored chunk believed to be flesh inside that bedroom. On June , it was reported that Carini had been charged with lying to federal authorities about the explosives and his injures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That now looks like a very unfortunate explanation. He has straightforwardly shot himself in the foot.It was Maxwell who introduced Andrew to Epstein. It was Maxwell who was Andrew’s guest at Buckingham Palace last summer. And it was Maxwell whose house was the venue for the infamous photo of Andrew with his arm round the bare midrf of young Virginia Roberts who says she was a sex slave for Epstein and a bit of flesh to service his important friends.Andrew told the BBC he went all the way to New York to break off his friendship with Epstein, by then a convicted paedophile. And then stayed for four days at his swanky Manhattan house where he was given a dinner in his honour.Oh, and shortly afterwards Epstein handed over £, as his contribution to the Help The Fergie Fund. It’s a very odd way to end a friendship.Epstein may have died in prison – no doubt very conveniently for lots of famous and powerful people – but it has not stopped the calls for prosecutions of those connected with Epstein, and the calls for justice from Epstein’s victims.The FBI have made it plain they want to talk to Andrew. But he seems determined to keep as far as possible away from them.Geoffrey Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told reporters earlier this year that Andrew had so far given zero co-operation.Lisa Bloom, representing the women who say they were abused by Epstein, called Andrew’s refusal to answer questions ‘a slap in the face’ for the women.Yet the pariah prince was at it again yesterday, insisting he has in fact offered to co-operate.Well there is a very simple way of finding out who is telling the truth. Let him publish the letters and emails he has sent to the US law enforcement agencies and we can judge for ourselves.Overall, Andrew has done more to undermine the British royal family than any other living person. He is the gt that just keeps on giving for those who want to replace the monarchy with a republic.When local councils earlier this year were told to fly the flag for his birthday there was uproar. The Sun captured it perfectly in its front page headline: Union Joke.Meanwhile a Yougov poll revealed that only  in  have a favourable opinion of him. The only surprise is that it was that high.Horrendous as all the Epstein and Maxwell stuff is, that is just one item in the charge sheet against Andrew.There is the calamitous way he damaged Britain’s image abroad over many years as our trade envoy as he went round the globe insulting those he came into contact with and belting out his saloon bar views, views very often the exact opposite of agreed government policy.Diplomats called him His Buffoon Highness for his mixture of arrogance, rudeness, ignorance and stupidity.There is his outrageous use of helicopters, often to get to golf courses, and private jets when commercial flights would do - all charged to the taxpayer.There is all the dodgy company in dodgy countries he has kept – nasty dictators, outright crooks, alleged torturers, even a convicted gunrunner - some of whom he has accepted gts from, and some he even weaselled into Buckingham Palace, so tainting the Queen with his dubious associates.There is the wealth he has amassed from questionable sources, whether through shady offshore companies, using a  name, Andrew Inverness, or direct from his dodgy friends.What a stroke of luck that he was able to offload his old house, Sunninghill Park, which had been on the market for years at £ million, to Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakh dictator, for £ million.Mr Kulibayev never moved in, the house sat empty for a further nine years before being demolished. Why would he pay well over the asking price for a house he never intended to live in And how astonishing on a grant from his mum of £, each year and a tiny naval pension of £,, he has been able to spend £.m refurbishing the property in Windsor Great Park AND get hold of a £m ski chalet in Switzerland.Then there is the appalling boorish behaviour to his protection staff. On at least one occasion he threw stuff on the ground and told them to “f---ing pick that up.”Or there is the casual racism, using phrases like “n----- in the woodpile” which he denies though plenty heard it, or making a jaw-dropping and hugely tasteless joke about camels at a state banquet for the Saudi royals. How to win friends and influence people!Even Donald Trump, who has played golf with Andrew, met him many times, and once lent him a plane, now say:s “I don’t know Prince Andrew.”We’ve all had enough of the obnoxious prince. He is a national embarrassment. When Princess Diana orced from Charles, she was immediately stripped of her HRH status yet the Prince of Sleaze keeps his. He should have his taken away without any further delay. Let him be Andrew Inverness, since he likes that name.The victims of Epstein will be scarred for le. If he has a scrap of decency left inside him, he will travel to the United States and tell the FBI all he knows.This is one trip for Air Miles Andy that the taxpayer would be prepared to pay for - especiallyit is a one-way ticket.       Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is why we remain utterly bewildered by the DoJs approach. However, a request from a commercial law firm is not and never will be the same as an official judicial process.Yesterday, during a press conference which detailed the charges against Maxwell, US officials once again invited Prince Andrew to speak with them.Mr Edwards said Epsteins victims are furious at claims the Duke has already cooperated with prosecutors.He said: Theres no doubt that hes deliberately evading authorities.“I mean, how much more clear - when have you ever heard a US attorneys office at a press conference say: were inviting you to come over...“You know, theres no doubt that they want to talk to him.Jeffrey Epstein was arrested last July but died in prison less than a month later while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors.Following his death, United States Attorney General William Barr promised to go after the paedos accomplices.

But new data, published today by the Government, shows that has risen slightly to . to ..The reality is the true R rate probably lies somewhere between the upper and lower estimates.A Government spokesman said: It is important to recognise that the most likely estimates are somewhere toward the middle of these ranges.Dr Konstantin Blyuss, a reader in maths at the University of Sussex, said while the numbers have changed, its only a very slight change.He said: The fact that there are almost no changes in these estimates since last week appear to suggest that the level of infection in the UK is plateauing rather than reducing.The R rate gives an indication of whether or not the Covid- outbreak is growing. Above one, and its a sign the epidemic is spreading, while below one indicates an outbreak in decline.But critics of the R rate have pointed out it does not tell us how quickly an epidemic is changing.Thats why the Government introduced a new measure - the growth rate, which gives insight on the size and speed of change, whereas the R rate only gives information on the direction of change.The rate of spread of the coronavirus infection across the UK - the growth rate - has moved from - per cent to - per cent per day to a wider range of - per cent to  per cent.Neither one measures is deemed better by the Government, but each provide information that is useful in monitoring the spread of disease.One thing to note is as the number of infections fall, the measures do become less useful, the number of new cases of the disease, for example.Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex, said: The growth rates have remained largely the same, but we have to be careful here.As the number of confirmed cases becomes smaller, the estimates of the growth rate and the R number become more sensitive in a sense that even a relatively small local outbreak can have a major effect on increasing the R number.She said while the R rate is important, it is crucial to have a detailed breakdown of cases at a local level, so community transmission can be quickly identied and contained.Dr Kyrychko warned with lockdown restrictions starting to ease it will take four to six weeks to see the full effect of more relaxed measures on the number of cases in each region.Opening of pubs on Saturday is, perhaps, the biggest change in terms of social interactions since the lockdown was introduced in March, and since the infection is still prevalent, it is essential to follow the guidelines on how to minimise the risk of acquiring and spreading the infection.  London was hit hardest by the epidemic, seeing the highest infection and death rates at the start of the outbreak.But, given the capital was two to three weeks ahead of the rest of the nation, the first green shoots of hope were evident in its boroughs, with rates tailing off first.The new figures, showing a slight uptick in the R rate, might suggest the rest of the nation is set to follow suit.As well as London, the R rate in the Midlands, South East, South West and Yorkshire and the North East, has also risen.In the capital, which was hardest hit in the early stages of the pandemic, the R rate has risen from . to . to . to ..In the Midlands its gone up from . to . to . to ..The results from the Midlands come just days after one of the regions biggest cities was forced into a localised lockdown.The easing of lockdown restrictions has been pushed back a further two weeks in Leicester after a spike in cases.Non-essential shops have closed in the city and pubs and restaurants will not be able to open for another two weeks.This is while in the South East the R rate went from . to . to . to ., in Yorkshire and the North East from . to . to . to . and in the South West from . to . to . to .. The only region to see a slight drop in their R rate is the North West, which had been bearing the recent brunt of the UKs outbreak until recently. There, the R rate dropped slightly from . to . to . to ..The update from the government comes just  hours after experts at Cambridge University released their own estimates as to what they believed that R rate was.The Cambridge experts predicted a median R rate, as well as what the upper rate would be.They stated: The Midlands has the highest probabilitythat R rate is above  and a central estimate for R rate of ..However, the numbers of new infections occurring in this region on a daily basis is relatively low.According to their data, the East of England has an R rate of ., London is at . along with the South West.The South East is at . and the North East and Yorkshire are at .. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All of our services will take a bit longer than usual.Charlottes Academy in Cowes, Isle of Wight, will be cutting customers hair from one minute past midnight until .am tomorrow morning.Charlotte Stephan, the salons owner, told the Mail Online: I then sent out a message to all my customers askingthey would be interested in booking appointments when they should be asleep, and I was overwhelmed by the response.Within a few minutes I was fully booked throughout the early hours of Saturday morning and into the remainder of the day and beyond. Im really blown away by how loyal my customers are and how much they have missed coming to the salon to get their hair done.Some are said to be sticking to their normal am-pm hours, but others say they plan to open their doors at am and work longer hours to get through their client list.Workers will be wearing gloves and a mask, and some salons could see perspex screens above the basins too.There is unlikely to be the usual chatter from your hairdresser, with talking kept to a minimum to reduce the potential spread of germs.The Prime Minister said he hoped the reopening of pubs, restaurants and hairdressers in England on Saturday would allow people to enjoy themselves, but in a safe way.Speaking on LBC this morning, Boris Johnson said: Tomorrow we come to step three of the plan that I set out on May , that everybody, I think, has understood, or huge numbers of people have understood and followed very carefully and very closely.And its because people stuck to that plan that were now able to carefully and cautiously open up hospitality tomorrow. And my message is really for people to enjoy summer sensibly and make sure that it all works.According to the governments -page blueprint, hairdressers and barbers are among businesses which will not be allowed to reopen until they meet Covid--secure guidelines.This may include measures such as the use of face masks - as has been seen for hair salons in countries in Europe - and social distancing.Many measures require the development of new safety guidelines that set out how each type of physical space can be adapted to operate safely, the government document reads.Salons are likely to operate at only  per cent capacity in order to maintain social distancing measures, with those cutting your hair working on sht patterns to minimise contact with staff and customers.It is also likely that not every station in the salon will be used, with hairdressers working at every other station in a bid to maintain a two-metre distance between them.The British Beauty Council recommends that staff wear gloves, masks and gowns, while customers will also likely have to wear masks and will not be able to have many belongings on them.Meanwhile the National Hair and Beauty Federation has asked hairdressers to keep salon chat to a minimum and avoid face-to-face discussions with clients.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On behalf of the victims we have continuously asked him to step forward, step up, be a man and tell us what he knows.He has been hiding behind not only the royal family but his attorneys.Regardless of his position we, on behalf of the victims, hope that he will step forward and speak up about what he witnessed, at the very least when he was visiting themansion in New York, when he visited the home in Palm Beach and when we know he was down visiting the Virgin Islands mansion.Andrews friendship with Ghislaine did not fade, despite Epsteins charges last summer.He secretly met Maxwell at Buckingham Palace on June  last year - a fortnight after US prosecutors said they would be reopening their inquiry into Epstein. Maxwell was in London for the Cash and Rocket rally for  of the worlds most successful women, and was pictured before a photocall at Wellington Arch.The British socialite has also previously been photographed at Prince Andrews side in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot, where admission is at Her Majestys discretion.Andrew failed to sever contacts with Epstein after he was first accused of under-age sex offences - causing many to wonder why.He ended up cutting ties with Epstein — but only after he was photographed walking with the financier in Central Park, New York.Maxwells arrest, with her knowledge of the alleged activities of the paedophile financer, must have been unnerving for the Royal Family, who are aware of Andrews close friendship with her.What Maxwell may reveal may have the potential to drag the good name of the Royal Family through the mud once again.Prince Andrews relations with Epstein and Maxwell has been causing concern and chaos for the last seven months - as revelations lap closer and closer to Buckingham Palace.Ever since his Newsnight interview where Andrew failed to offer any sympathy for Epstein’s victims and showed no remorse over his friendship with the billionaire sex offender, fears about the implications for the Prince have multiplied.In the prominent photo of Prince Andrew, standing with his arm around teenager Virginia Roberts who alleges her and the Price had sex three times, Maxwell is standing in the background.Her arrest now may lead to more information on what supposedly went on - especially considering it was Maxwell who first introduced Andrew to the disgraced financier.As the Royal Family and their advisers have agonised over how best to protect the integrity of the monarchy from the fall-out of the Epstein affair, there may be some slim consolation.The charges brought by the FBI against Maxwell relate to a period in the mid-s — before Prince Andrew had ever met Epstein.The decision to strip Andrew of all royal duties and force him to step down from official engagements also, in hindsight, was a good move.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Pubs, hairdressers, hotels, campsites, restaurants, cinemas, museums and galleries can all open on July  in England. There are also changes to gatherings and the two-metre rule, allowing you to becloser to those you love. Then on July , thereaposll be big changes to quarantine for people wanting to go on holiday - plus, aposshieldingapos people can hug and kiss relatives for the first time. But nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, nail and tanning salons, tattoo studios and bowling alleys stay shut. All the venues allowed to open will look dferent to before - with screens, social distancing and booking systems. But so-called aposSuper Saturdayapos - held appropriately on US aposIndependence Dayapos - will still see far more venues open at once than many people thought would ever happen. And Downing Street has refused to say whether itaposs expecting the changes to push the crucial aposRapos rate of infection above one. That has triggered fears that debauched scenes in pubs and bars could trigger new outbreaks of the virus.  The government has already had to enforce a local lockdown in Leicester, where the below measures wonapost happen - and schools and non-essential shops have shut. Boris Johnson has urged people to stick to the rules and not turn into a roiling, bacchanalian mass. So what can you do from July , evenyou donapost want to  And what is still off the table  Hereaposs a complete guide for England. Please note Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have separate rules. Things you can do already  Non-essential shops, schoolsand other premises like car showrooms and outdoor markets have already reopened in England. People are now allowed to gather in groups of up to six outdoors in a park or garden, with social distancing. The .million most vulnerable people, who are aposshieldingapos, have been allowed to go outside alone or with one other personfor walks. And people can form a support bubble, joining two households together permanently to hug, kiss, stay the night and share childcare. However, indoor gatherings of two or more people not in the same household or bubble are still banned. And people are still banned from staying overnight away from where they live. From July , much of those laws are being abolished in England and replaced with guidance. Things you can do from July  Venues that CAN reopen in England from July  All these venues can reopen in England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs Holiday apartments or homes Cottages or bungalows Campsites Caravan parks Boarding houses Places of worship Libraries Community centres Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens Bars Pubs Cinemas Bingo halls Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example Museums and galleries Hair salons and barbers Outdoor playgrounds Outdoor gyms Funfairs Theme parks Adventure parks and activities Amusement arcades Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos.You can visit friends and family indoors - but you canapost hug  People in England can have people round their house, including to stay overnight from July  - but they can’t hug. For the first time since March, indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. This applies to all indoor gatherings, be they in private homes or in places like pubs . When you are indoors, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time. There is no limit on the size of either of the households which can meet. And unlike with bubbles, ’exclusivity’ is not required. So you can have one friend round for a meal one weekend and another friend round another weekend. But dferent households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they meet. That means following the m or ‘m plus’guidance, and also following other advice such as regular hand washing. You can meet more people outdoors  There is a slight change to the rules for people meeting outdoors from July . Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing. This limit will continue, but it will change from a legal restriction to guidance, plus there will also now be another option. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - can now also meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number from one household. The two-metre rule is changing  The -metre social distancing rule in England is changing from July . Where it’s not possible to stay  metres apart, people are instead advised to keep to a distance of “one metre plus”. This means staying one metre apart - plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. On public transport, it means people stay one metre away but with a face covering. In other spaces it will likely mean having screens between tables, making sure people face away from each other, putting in hand washing facilities, minimising amount of time spent with people from dferent households., and being outdoors where possible. Government officials say mitigations at one metre have a “broadly equivalent impact” as staying two metres apart. But the risk of catching the virus from someone is still much higheryouaposre one metre away from them, compared to two metres away. If you can stay m apart, you should.  Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens can all reopen in England from July  - both indoor and outdoors. But thereaposs a catch -youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigationyou canapost manage two metres. Loud music, dance floors, propping up the bar or standing in groups are all banned, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues are expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. But landlords aren’t expected to police which household customers belong to, or check ID of everyone coming in. Hairdressers and barbers are allowed to reopen in England from July  with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. Millions of Brits can finally get a haircut after more than three months of having their locks chopped at home. But they will be appointment-only, use disposable gowns and in many cases use a one-in, one-out system. Nail salons, which involve people sitting face to face, will remain shut for the foreseeable. And eyelash extensions are largely ruled out because of the amount of face-to-face contact. You can go on staycation - but not to hostels  Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses can all reopen to paying guests in England from July . Again, they must follow Covid-secure guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites will be able to reopen in England from July . This includes showers and washing-up blocks. But hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet. This is dferent to Wales which is keeping both campsites and hostels shut. You can get married - but not have a proper reception  Church services - including weddings - are allowed from July theyaposre done in a socially-distanced way. But only up to  people can attend including the couple, officiants, guests, photographers, security and caterers. And limits still apply on indoor gatherings, meaning there wonapost really be a chance to have a reception. Ceremonies should be concluded in the shortest reasonable time and hands should be washed before and after and the rings are exchanged. Brides can be walked down the aisle - but not arm-in-arm, unless the escort lives in the same household. Books, service sheets and prayer mats should be removed - with single-use alternatives provided as long as they are removed by the person attending the wedding.  You can go to church - but not sing Places of worship reopen in England from July , as above. But not full singing services, due to the risk of spreading the virus. You can visit cinemas, galleries and museums  Saturday  July is the date cinemas, galleries and museums can reopen in England. Guidance includes one-way systems, spaced queuing, increased ventilation, and pre-booked tickets. A No source said: We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus. But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these stepsit is necessary to stop the virus running out of control. Things you can do from July  Shielded people can meet groups of friends outside  Shielding will be eased for .million vulnerable people in Englandfrom Monday July . They can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end on August , prompting alarm. Thereaposs also anger at the failure to have a legal safeguard against people being forced back to work. What about travel  Can I go on holiday  From Saturday, the Foreign Officeaposs warning against all but essential international travel will be lted for some countries.And from  July, people ing to England from certain countries will not need to self-isolate. The countries that England has exempted from the quarantine rule are here At the time of publishing th UK government has not published the list of colour coded countries setting out the risk of travelling to certain countries.  Things you still canapost do from July  Venues that CANaposT reopen in England from July  These venues are still banned from reopening and have no confirmed date:Nightclubs Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Spas Nail bars Beauty salons Swimming pools Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Water parks Indoor fitness and dance studios Gyms Conference centres, other than for people who already work there.You canapost go to the gym  Government sources said gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces. That outraged the gym industry, which demanded a date. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden later insisted: Subject to public health, our aspiration is to reopen gyms  leisure facilities in mid-July.

Most of us, when confronted by the option of telling a convicted child abuser we did not want to see him again a over the phone, or b on a -day bender at the abuseraposs house, would feel that socially-distancing oneself from the paedophile is the most sensible course of action.But then, these fiends target only princes, donapost they  They groom honourable, sudorerousally-challenged aristocrats with offers of friendship.

There, she was presented with a child-size version of James Bondaposs Aston Martin DB. It had hand-stitched leather seats, revolving number plates, toy machine guns, a bullet proof shield, water jets, -way radio, working smokescreen, ground radar, and two v electric batteries which gave it a top speed of mph. It took  technicians  months to make it as a gt for the young prince, who was  at the time. The car is now part of the Royal Collection, and on public display in the stables at Sandringham. It may not have been used as much as the average childaposs pedal car, because it is spotless.

When the government told us not to drink in pubs, he said he would. Now weaposre told we must go to the pub, and heaposs gone to Greece.In doing so, and despite being a guest there, he boasted of breaking Greek border controls to travel to his holiday home, insisting it was essential travel because he was preparing to make lots of lovely money by renting it out.Why wouldnapost Boris be an unprincipled laundry hamper of a human being, with a role model like that  Granted, Stanleyaposs other children seem much better behaved. Boris seems to have inherited the full dose of his dadaposs twattery.Privilege is an over-used word, these days, but the concept of some people being given a special advantage, and immunity from the consequences of abusing it, is the fundamental reason why we have the scandals dominating the news today. From black lives mattering, to white gun-wavers, long-term jobless Ghislaine Maxwellaposs £m in cash, and the Duke of Yorkaposs sudden rediscovery of his sweat glands, it all comes down to the gts people are given as children.But perhaps we should stop thinking of privilege as a blessing.

While Janet usually does not allow the tot in the kitchen, he had managed to slip through a safety gate which had momentarily been left open. Janet heard the toddler screaming in pain after he doused himself in boiling water. His older brother, Ryan, , heard his brotheraposs wails of agony too and dashed downstairs from his bedroom in the nick of time. By a fortunate twist of fate, the teen had just completed a course at a fire station before the lockdown - and calmly began applying his new skills.

I just calmly took Alfie to the shower and put the water on. Being a firefighter was something I thought I would like to do - but now I know I want to.

After months of waiting and craving, weaposre just hours away from finally being able to enjoy a cold pint in the pub. People in England canapost wait to get back into their favourite boozer on Saturday, and bargain chain JD D Wetherspoon is preparing for a busy weekend. Staff at the Mossy Well in Muswell Hill will open its doors two hours before theyaposre allowed to sell alcohol, and theyaposre expecting to have people queuing outside. However there are going to be some big changes in the pub to ensure customers and staff can follow social-distancing rules safely . When customers doto the vast public house, which is inside a former North London tea room, theyaposll notice adaptations before theyaposre even inside. Front doors have been clearly marked so there is one way in and one way out, and tables have been spaced to the one metre plus distance according to government guidelines. There are hand sanitiser dispensers newly installed on walls and stickers at the bar clearly mark where customers should stand. Anyone staying for a drink will have to do so from a table, meaning propping up the bar and stand up drinking between tables will be strictly prohibited. Those who do choose to queue at the bar will be asked to pay by card to minimise contact, although cash payments will still be taken.  Around tables and in front of the bar there are plastic screens designed to stop the spread the droplets, and single use paper food menus will be placed on tables for hungry punters. Anyone used to ordering Wetherspoonaposs food may notice one change as soon as their table is set, however. Wetherspoon spokesperson Eddie Gershon explains: The ketchupaposs dferent. Weaposve had to move from bottles to sachets for obvious reasons - we hope people wonapost mind too much. When the Mossy Well is full it can hold  people but that figure will be considerably less under the new tables-only set up.  And when thereaposs no more room, a one-in one-out queue will be operated at the door by a member of staff with a counter. As for who enforces social distancing rules inside, Wetherspoons is placing faith in their loyal customers to adhere to the rules and drink responsibly. Gershon said: The idea is to create a drinking environment which the public will recognise and feel comfortable in. We wonapost be policing the toilets and we wonapost have staff walking around with a tape measure, we have signs up with very clear directions and our staff will be on hand to answer any questions. What people will find when they come back to their local Wetherspoon is that the atmosphere is still great and the beer still tastes good. Thataposs whataposs theyaposve been waiting for and weaposre very excited to be able to give people that service again.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA cyclist who lost her leg after she was hit by a skip lorry has got back on the saddle - five years after the crash. Victoria Lebrec was cycling along Londonaposs Old Street one morning in  when she was suddenly struck from the right hand side and thrown to the ground. The back wheels of the truck ran over the -year-oldaposs pelvis, shattering it and causing huge internal bleeding. A police officer was quick to arrive at the scene and stroked Victoriaaposs hair as she lay in the road, desperately trying but failing to speak. Victoria clung to le as air ambulance paramedics performed an invasive technique only used when a casualty is on the cusp of death. Thanks to the quick actions of emergency service workers she survived and, after several days, woke from a coma to begin the months long road to recovery. Five years on from a crash that nearly killed her, Victoria has ridden a bike again for the first time. I just really, really like cycling, she explained. I will be able to cycle again but it will take lots of time and effort learning how to do it. I really want to get back on a bike properly again. It’s a really nice thing to do. Before the crash Victoria was a regular cyclist on Londonaposs roads, commuting to work on her bike and riding while on holiday. While she felt confident peddling around the capital, she had had a few near misses - like most people who have navigated the car dominated roads of London.  However, Victoriaaposs le changed forever when an HGV driven by Paul-Ioan Mihacea smashed into her in an incident she insists on referring to as a crash and not an accident - the dference being that it was preventable, like many of the , cyclists injured and  killed on UK roads in . The fact she didnapost find herself in the latter camp was largely due to air ambulance paramedics performing a REBOA. The rare technique stems rapid blood loss by placing a flexible catheter into the femoral artery and inflating a dam like balloon at its tip. She was only the second person in the country to survive such dramatic surgery. Despite viewing the loss of her leg as entirely preventable, Victoria has not held a grudge against Mr Mihacea. After he was fined £ and given five penalty points for careless driving at Blackfriars Crown Court in , the two came face to face outside the courtroom. He didn’t do this intentionally obviously, Victoria said. He looked really ashen faced and said he was sorry. It was an emotional moment. His le had been affected by what happened too. We hugged.  Although she found peace with Mr Mihacea, who was speaking on a hands free phone in the moments before the crash, she is not content with the current cycling situation on Londonaposs streets. Having left her pre-crash career in advertising behind her, Victoria now campaigns for safer conditions for cyclists through charity Roadpeace. As well as campaigning for better infrastructure at junctions, segregated cycle lanes and HGVs more suited to navigating narrow city roads, she wants drivers to start thinking more about cyclists. Old Street in east London is one of the UKaposs best examples of cyclists being put in dangerous situations because of poor road planning. In the four years after Victoria was hit, both Julie Dinsdale and Sarah Doone were struck down by HGVs on the same road. Like Victoria, both luckily survived but lost a leg. These women are just three of the  cyclists that have been hit on Old Street and the adjoining Clerkenwell Road since  according to the Department for Transport, with  of that number seriously injured and one killed. The need to improve the conditions on Britainaposs roads has rarely been more pressing than it is now, as the lockdown pushes people off public transport and onto bikes. Although extensive research has not be conducted, the Bicycle Association recorded a % year-on-year increase in bike sales in April, suggesting millions more Brits are hopping onto the saddle. In a bid to sooth the fears of the % of people a pre-lockdown Government survey found believed cycling on the roads was too dangerous, £million of emergency funding has been released to ease congestion.  I don’t have PTSD, but now I am extremely wary of roads and intolerant of people driving badly, the Hackney resident continued. People don’t realise how much they’re putting other people at risk. As for the so-called war of the roads programmes, such as Channel aposs aposCyclists: Scourge of the Roadapos, Victoria says there needs to be a truce between the two-wheeled and four-wheeled travellers.  I can understand that there’s animosity but taking risks is just not worth those extra few seconds, she said. Remember these are all just people trying to get to their destinations.

Six days later I nearly died.It turns out that I had actually been suffering with ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease – but I didn’t find that out until after a painful ordeal in which I lost my large bowel. I had fallen sick drastically fast, experiencing a raft of unusual symptoms throughout . I was losing an excessive amount of weight despite eating normally, was regularly constipated and had a few episodes of severe abdominal cramping. I even experienced bad rectal bleeding in the work toilets, with blood dripping down the back of my legs. I went to the doctor several times where I was told it was possibly just piles, that had ‘disappeared’ by the time I got checked out, or just me having bad periods. The weight loss was blamed on my history of having an eating disorder. I felt ignored, fobbed off and like I wasn’t being listened to or taken seriously at all. In early January of , I came home from a driving lesson feeling really sick. I ran to the toilet and threw up. I was sweating and feeling drowsy, so I went straight to bed and put it down to a tummy bug.  The next few days are a blur. I had a fever and was going to the toilet with chronic diarrhoea around  times a day. It felt like acid and my stomach was in excruciating pain. I called the doctor, explaining I couldn’t attend an appointment because I couldn’t get off the toilet, but they refused to come out to me, and instead prescribed me Buscopan over the phone. The next day, I felt so unwell that I went to AE where I was told that it was likely gastroenteritis. I went back again the next day, because I had deteriorated even more, and once again was sent home. I went to stay with my mum the day after that. After just one night, she found me curled up on the floor, holding my stomach in excruciating pain. My mum demanded that her doctor book me an appointment for that morning.  The doctor took my observations and told me that I had a high fever and was tachycardic - meaning my heart was beating too fast. He suspected I had appendicitis and sent me to the hospital. In the waiting room I  was so out of it and crying in pain, before being taken down for emergency surgery to have my appendix removed. I woke up in a hospital bed in a side room, with small bandages on my stomach. They told me the surgery had gone well and that I would be home before I knew it. I felt relieved, but I still felt awful.But instead of getting better, I started getting worse. There were worries that I was septic, because my temperature was extremely high and I was still tachycardic. Over the space of five days, I just got worse and worse. I was on the maximum amount of pain relief I could have - not even morphine was working. I was going to the toilet every few minutes and it was painful to go, and had this awful smell that didn’t seem normal.  On the sixth day of that week, Saturday, I was laying in the hospital bed when I started screaming as a popping noise came from my stomach. I had never heard anything like it. I was rushed down to theatre for surgery. Three hours later I woke up with a stoma bag. I will never, ever forget the agony I felt that day - both physically and mentally. I thought my le had been turned upside down. I couldn’t even bear to look at it. Every time I did I just cried.  It turns out that I had actually been suffering with ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. The ‘popping’ noise was my bowel perforating. It was so heavily diseased that they had to remove the whole large bowel and give me a stoma bag. We decided to sue the hospital, and it took five years to get £,. Which just took me out of my overdraft.  months after the surgery, I had a reversal, which joined my small bowel to my rectum to allow me to go to the toilet ‘normally again’. But my le isn’t normal. I go to the toilet around  times a day and have chronic diarrhoea.

Antwayne Plummer was caught on another driveraposs dashcam as he sharply accelerated the blue Mercedes E towards the officer in Ipswich, on Wednesday, February , before crashing into a police car. The -year-old admitted dangerous driving at Ipswich Crown Court, Suffolk Police said. He also admitted driving whilst disqualied, driving without insurance and aggravated vehicle taking causing property damage. The force said the defendant, who was sentenced yesterday for the incident and a separate earlier incident in the Holborn area of London, was jailed for  months.  The London incident on Friday January , involved offences of driving while disqualied and possession of cannabis. Judge David Pugh also banned him from driving for  months and ordered him to take an extended retest. The court heard how Plummer of Newham, east London, had been forced to give up his football career after he was attacked with a machete. Dan Taylor, defending, said Plummer fell into the wrong crowd following the kne attack and began to take drugs. He added: He did not intentionally drive in the direction of the police officer in that car. It was the unintended consequence of Mr Plummer trying to avoid capture. Mr Plummer is extremely remorseful for his driving that day. The court heard how automatic number plate recognition cameras picked up a suspicious vehicle crossing the Suffolk border from Essex on the evening of February .  Two police cars had tried to stop the Mercedes in Ipswich by boxing it in, but when two officers got out of the police car in front, the Mercedes reversed into the car behind then drove at one of the officers. The Mercedes was brought to a stop when a third police car made tactical contact with it and it was boxed in by the car behind. Plummer, of Salisbury Road in Newham in East London, continued to rev the engine of the Mercedes in an aggressive manner and he and his passenger, a -year-old man, refused to unlock the doors. Officers forced entry to the car and both men were arrested. Plummeraposs passenger faces no further police action.  The Mercedes belonged to a vehicle hire company which had rented it out for two weeks from its office in Watford on Valentineaposs Day, police said. Acting Chief Inspector Gary Miller, of the Roads and Armed Policing Team, said: This is another example of the danger faced by our officers on a daily basis and how they put themselves in harmaposs way to protect the public.

Craig Harker, who runs The George Pub and Grill in Stockton, is looking to fill five positions at three pubs after the government announced bars and restaurants would be able to reopen their doors on July . The roles for bar staff, a kitchen chef, a pot washer and an apprentice front of house were posted on social media and racked up hundreds of comments - but it was the wording of the advert which attracted attention, as reported by Teeside Live. Serving up a taste of whataposs to come, Craig begins the advert by stating: Yes youaposll be working for an a***hole but who isnapost these days lol but Iaposm a fair one and everyone who works for me enjoys being at work.He advises anyone hopeful of landing a role to show up smart and presentable, adding: Dont come to an interview with your chipped finger nails, scraggly hair and just been on a session red eye. Come looking to impress me. If you come and your clothes are creased to bits then I wont be having your lazy a*** anywhere behind my bar. Before you come downyou feel your breath is a little tangy then it probably is, get yourself a tic tac before your burn my eyes.  In the description for a bar person, it states anyone with banter like a aposwet flannelapos should look where because I donapost have the time or patience to teach someone how to be sociable just because youaposve played Call of duty for the last  years instead of having proper mates. For the same role in another pub, applicants are told professional experience is essential, not home bar experience or the fact you made everyone a jager bomb in the park using crisp packets. Although thataposs creative itaposs not what Iaposm after. The advert for a pot washer reads: Yep itaposs one of those grubby jobs but you get good pot washers and s**** ones. Iaposm after a good one. Pot wash athletes only. The post has had more than  shares and  comments, so it looks like the brutally honest advert successfully got the word out there - but not everyone was impressed.

Forest East services, on the M, has been sliced in two under the quarantine zone put in place on the coronavirus-hit city meaning pedestrians should not cross over the bridge to reach other side. The news of the split has bemused locals with one posting online: This is ridiculous. Wouldnapost it just be easier to bend the line around the perimeter of the southbound services to make it outside the lockdown area  Another called the split pathetic while another slammed it as bonkers. A fourth local said: Why didnapost they just lock down the whole of the City and County  Would have saved all the confusion. If I could Iaposd give a prize to whoever comes up with the best reason for not doing this. County council leader Nick Rushton admitted the service station was affected by the confusing boundary, which has seen streets in the city split down the middle. Cllr Rushton told BBC Radio Leciester: “Look at Leicester Forest East Service Station for example. “One side is in, one side is out. “If you arrive on the side going south, which is in the restriction zone, you are not supposed to cross the bridge to go over to the other side.  “The M is the line. “There are other bridges that cross the M.”Leicester was put into the UKaposs first local lockdown on Monday , coronavirus cases in the area were identied - ten per cent of all cases across the country.Almost , cases were confirmed in just two weeks - three times higher than the nearest city.  Anyone who falls within the lockdown boundary has been urged to stay at home and avoid non-essential travel to and from the area. But residents have been left confused by the boundary map, with council chiefs bombarded with emails from fed-up residents. In one village, some residents are not affected but others living a matter of inches away are. In Scraptoft, Kathleen McDonagh, , will have to wait at least two weeks before she can go to the pub or the hair salon.  In contrast, Veronica Cayless, also , who lives opposite her, is free to head to her local on Saturday as she is outside of the lockdown boundary. Mrs McDonagh admitted she was looking forward to seeing her grandson for the first time since March. She told Mail Online That is what I was looking forward to. I used to see him every day. I really miss him. It is awful. I miss not going to the shops. I like to meet my sister in town once a month and have a cup of tea, but I have not seen her since March, either.  But Mrs Cayless, who is not affected by the new lockdown, said she is looking forward to seeing one of her sons for the first time since Christmas. Cllr Rushton said he had had  emails in one night - but claimed it was impossible to create a perfect boundary. While the northbound side of the service station falls outside the lockdown zone, the southbound half is classed as being inside the boundary. It technically means staff and users cannot move from one side of the facility to the other.  He said “It’s been a very dficult job coming up with the zone. “When people say, aposit was the county councilaposs zoneapos - it is not our zone. “We were in charge of drawing up the map in consultation with Public Health England and the Department of Health based on the evidence we have got, and the outbreaks in and around the city. “It was refined and refined and refined.

Ashley Mealor, from Vision Direct, which carried out the research, said: Face masks will become the norm, and users will need to find ways to make them comfortable and effective. They will take a bit of getting used to, as they can be uncomfortable, particularlyyou are a glasses wearer, have a skin condition, or are particularly sensitive. Some people may just not like the feeling of being claustrophobic - there are lots of reasons why it may be dficult to get the whole of the general public to embrace mask wearing.But as other countries have demonstrated, this may become necessary to fight the pandemic once and for all. The study also found  per cent of adults havenapost yet tried using a mask at all, despite it now being compulsory for public transport, and the norm in places like supermarkets and shops. And % will refuse to wear a mask when exercising, while % would ditch it for a date.

She had received a notication through her Nest doorbell while she was out that somebody had been to the door, and the device also sends her footage for home-monitoring and security. The video she was sent had no audio, but when she ed home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the aposweirdapos incident in Delaware. And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having snuck a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order. Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled aposDo we need any additional instructions to find this address apos, her son had written: No but knock on the door  times and scream abra cadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away. Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van - exactly as instructed.Itaposs had more than two million views and , shares after Lynn posed it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her sonaposs instructions, with the caption: Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman! Apparently, my youngest son had put some aposadditional instructionsapos for delivery and she went along with it.

After welcoming baby Lynnlee, Michele Oller, , soon found herself with a freezer full of surplus milk. She wanted to put it to good use, so took to the internet and found a website dedicated to selling breast milk. Michelle, who had her first child with her husband Colby, , on February , , uploaded a post advertising the  gallons she had available and assumed she would connect with fellow mums in need of milk for their babies. But instead she received an influx of hair-raising requests from men. Pharmacist Michele of Durant, Oklahoma, USA, said: One site I used was full of strange men. I highly doubt they wanted the milk for their babies. A few of them asked me for photos, which was creepy enough in itself, and said a lot about their motives. I also got a couple of requests from men askingI would physically nurse them.” When two months passed and she had still not received a single genuine request from a concerned parent, Michele took her advert down.Luckily, soon after, she stumbled upon the Facebook group Human Milk  Human Babies, through which she found five parents to donate to.She said: Itaposs such a rewarding thing to do, and what really struck me is how many more women are looking for donations than there are women making them. If someone has a surplus, there are plenty of babies out there in need.” Shortly after giving birth to Lynnlee, who arrived at AllianceHealth Hospital, Durant, weighing lb oz, Michele realised she was producing more breast milk than required. To prevent the surplus going to waste, she began storing it in her freezer. Initially, she had planned to nurse Lynnlee for six months, but when she reached that milestone in August , she decided to keep going. I had planned on weaning after six months, like a lot of other mothers,” she said. “But after doing some research about the role breast milk can play - particularly in helping babies fight off infection - I decided I wanted to carry on. “I was going back to work around the same time and would have been exposed to all kinds of germs and bugs. I wanted do whatever I could to protect Lynnlee. When I found out my breast milk contained natural antibodies, I knew I had to keep it up.  But, even with her newfound determination to breastfeed Lynnlee indefinitely, Michele was producing so much milk that it was clear she was not going to get through it all. Expressing, on average, seven surplus litres per month, by November last year, her freezer was full to the brim. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, freshly expressed milk must only be stored for  months, so Michele began to fret it would go to waste. She explained: “I spoke to a friend of mine, who is a neonatal nurse, and she told me all about breast milk donation. “It turned out I could help other mums who couldn’t nurse for whatever reason, but still wanted their babies to have breast milk rather than formula. I had no idea about it, which seems ridiculous because it makes so much sense. Excited at the prospect of being able to donate her milk, Michele immediately looked into it – only to discover that her nearest bank was  miles away in neighbouring Texas. Searching online instead, she found a website dedicated to selling breast milk. Feeling uncomfortable about making a profit, she listed hers at  per ounce. Soon, her inbox was filling up with requests from interested buyers – but they were not desperate new mothers.

The tribute which perches on a rock in the sea off a pier in Copenhagen, Denmark, was daubed with the words in black spray paint. The -year-old sculpture, which is visited by one million tourists each year, has been vandalised before, including by anti-whaling campaigners and pro-democracy activists, twice suffering decapitation. Local police say they had not yet identied the perpetrators. We consider it vandalism and have started an investigation, a spokesman for the Copenhagen police said.  Protesters of the Black Lives Matter movement around the world have in recent months rallied against statues of historical figures who played a role in racist oppression, such as slave traders and colonialists. The Little Mermaid has not been part of this debate, but last year a Disney live action remake of the  animated film of the same name, was the subject of a controversy, after African American actress Halle Bailey was cast in the movieaposs lead role.The -year-old singer and actress told USA she had faced some racist comments over her casting. I feel like Iaposm dreaming and Iaposm just grateful and I donapost pay attention to the negativity, she told Variety at the Power of Young Hollywood gala. I just feel like this role was something bigger than me and greater and itaposs going to be beautul. Iaposm just so excited to be a part of it.Jodi Benson, who voiced Ariel in the original, backed the casting of Ms Bailey. I think that the spirit of a character is what really matters, she said.

Anika de Beer died in the blazing wreckage on the eve of her th birthday after she got behind the flight controls of the Piper Cherokee A- to do solo practice landings and circuits at her local airfield. Her delighted mum Rika and dad Andries had presented their -year-old daughter with the traditional bottle of bubbly for her first lone flight even though she was still too young to drink. But just days later the talented pilot is believed to have lost control and stalled as she prepared to land at Wonderboom Airport in Pretoria, South Africa, and crashed at high speed away from the runway. Her distraught parents have now had to her cancel her birthday bash planed for Saturday and instead invited her grief-stricken friends to attend her funeral. Another pilot who had just landed saw the plume of smoke rising up from the flames of the crashed aircraft and radioed it into the control tower after radio contact with Anika ended. The airfieldaposs fire brigade were quickly at the scene along with ambulances but could do nothing for the teenage pilot whose charred body was found inside the burnt out Piper Cherokee. A senior local pilot said: I haven no wish to prejudge the accident report but the wreckage shows that it was a high speed impact and I would suspect the plane stalled while making an approach turn.  Anika would never have been allowed to fly solo by her instructorhe was not % confident she was ready and when she did her first solo flight a few days before she didnapost put a foot wrong. Unless there was a structural or engine failure we may never know what happened up there but her loss has hit everyone in our community at Wonderboom Airfrield extremely hard. Anika had done just over  hours training and was due to take her Private Pilotaposs Licence after she turned  tomorrow and had set her heart on flying passenger jets for South African Airways.  DevastatedTearful mum Rika said: “Anika was the joy in our lives and our red-haired little pilot. Her ambition was to travel and see the whole world as a commercial pilot flying a Boeing. “There is a world map in her bedroom on the wall and she said that when that day came she would soon know every corner of the earth. Flying was her passion and her biggest dream”. Anika’s distraught parents said that her funeral would be held on Saturday instead of her th birthday party adding: “Our hearts are shattered – she was our everything. We are lost.  She was a member of the Professional Flight Centre at Wonderboom Airport and centre advisor Karel Ehmke confirmed Anika had gone up to do solo circuits and landing flight training. Karel said:She was a brilliant pilot and died doing what she loved most - being a pilot. Under South African Air Law a student pilot can learn to fly at  and fly solo at  but cannot apply to take their Private Pilotaposs Licence until they are  which Anika had planned to do.  She had just  hours of flight training under her belt and was flying on her second solo flight. Owner of the flight centre Andre le Roux said he could comment further as an investigation is underway into the death of the young pilot but added: We are all severely traumatised by it. The Tswane Emergency Medical Services declared the schoolgirl dead at the scene and the Accident and Incident Investigation Division have been called in to prepare a report into the tragedy.

People are rightly concerned for their health, however, they’re also fearful for their jobs. The introduction of these risk-based measures would allow us to strike the important balance of protecting public health while getting the country and our economy moving again.“Adopting a dferent approach is going to do further damage to our aviation sector which has already been buffeted by widespread job losses, and it will have wider, long term implications on the ability of our economy to recover. This isn’t just about people being able to go on a summer holiday, it’s about safely re-establishing the routes that drive trade and investment.”First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hoped a decision could be taken #quickly# on plans for visitors to Scotland.At her daily briefing, she said: #We want to welcome visitors again from around the world and we also want to allow our own citizens to travel.#We also want,possible for obvious practical reasons, to have alignment on these matters with the rest of the UK.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Marianne Taylor  We   re all public health guinea pigs now    but that   s just the way it has to be","story":"Irsquove also started planning a wee holiday up north and have booked a hairdressersrsquo appointment. Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe. Affront will be taken at any restriction on free transit between south and north. Presumably residents of Scotland who visit England will also be tested or quarantined on their , making it a two-way injunction. Suddenly a weekend break in Northumberland looks a lot less appealing.:YouGov Poll: Half of Conservative voters in England support English independenceYet how exactly would it work  Is it only tourists who will be checked, or will those travelling back and forth for work, be they lorry drivers or business reps, also be subject to testing  Will every road, rail and sea route across the Border from Berwick to Workington be patrolled  Might we see a surge in midnight crossings over no-manrsquos land and rivers, four-by-fours finally justying their existence and canoes retrofitted to ferry families plus their luggage across the Tweed As things stand, there have been no new cases of the virus in the Scottish Borders in two weeks. This beautul, windswept district is starting to feel like a cordon sanitaire, a buffer between the haves and,not precisely the have-nots, then a population beginning slowly but steadily to paralyse the disease.Given our reputation as one of the sickest countries in Europe, we need to take every precaution to protect lives. Reimposing the Border as a barrier and guard would not be popular, and the war-time and military resonances are unsettling. Yet, in light of the high risk of contagion still posed by parts of the south, in the short term it would make sense. If the first thing passengers see as they arrive is not a sig welcoming them to Scotland but an NHS squad, then for the first time since  ndash the last pitched battle between England and Scotland ndash the Border will have regained its old role as the countryrsquos first line of defence.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

This is a far less serious matter than his becoming Cabinet Secretary. It has few,any, constitutional implications. I worked for a previous incumbent for a couple of years.

That could be work for a trusted political appointee.:Agenda: Proposed new law could make JK Rowling a criminalIs it a good appointment  That is a more subjective question, and less fundamental. Mr Frostrsquos predecessors have been very senior diplomats, with deep grounding across Britainrsquos foreign policy and security concerns ndash former heads of the Diplomatic Service, Ambassadors in Washington, Paris, Permanent Representatives in Brussels, both to the EU and to Nato. Some have done more than one of these big jobs, in wide, senior international careers.Mr Frost is able and, importantly, has the Prime Ministerrsquos confidence. But his diplomatic career culminated in the important, but not central, ambassadorship to Denmark. He then ran the important, but not central, Scotch Whisky Association, and was special advisor to Mr Johnson, as a Foreign Secretary who earned mixed reviews. Judging Mr Frostrsquos role as chief Brexit negotiator may be premature. But it is odd, after the justied criticism of Sir Mark Sedwillrsquos being both Cabinet Secretary and National Security Adviser, that Mr Frost should have to combine the climax of Brexit negotiations with whatever Middle Eastern politics, for instance, or terrorism, may serve up in the coming months.Choosing the new Cabinet Secretary matters more.

Eventhose appointing his successor want a revolution in Whitehall, it would be goodhe or she thoroughly understands the constitutional arrangements to be overhauled, within which crises are bound to happen.

They might agree with her, too, that feminism has tended to look down on womenwho choose to stay at home and care for children rather than join the  to .Admittedly, it can sometimes feel as though the only gains to have been made in feminism are surface ones, easily erased when times get tough. It has often been that way: see the two world wars. I look at the younger women of today and they are still underpaid and undervalued still afraid to claim their place in society as the equal of men still afraid to walk home alone at night. If this is progress it looks dishearteningly modest.Yet I also see the likes of the #MeToo movement and think of old Harvey behind bars. I see women going to court to enforce their employment rights. I see them speaking up, determined not to take the same sexist nonsense we often did. Saying you are not a feminist today is distinctly uncool. Women are out there, holding down jobs, looking after children and elderly relatives, keeping a home going. And they are doing so with partners by their side.Irsquom enough of a vintage to remember when it was a rare sight to see a man pushing a pram in the street. Poor soul, must be widowed.

I have used such facilities in Kinlochbervie, Findhorn, the Glen Coe ski area and throughout the Western Isles.Rather than suggest \"banning\" camper vans from overnight parking can I suggest community councils look at ways of helping to create an infrastructure that will provide safe, low-cost overnight parking whilst creating a source of income for the communities themselves  We only have to look at the success of the Aires network in most European countries to realise that here in Scotland we are decades behind in how we treat this kind of tourism.Campervans already provide a considerable amount of money to rural economies. Owners buy fuel for their vehicles, eat and drink in local restaurants and pubs and buy supplies from supermarket and small village shops. In a country that claims to be progressive I find it extraordinary that community councils should actively oppose camper van tourism.Making informal camping by camper vans illegal would require a major change to UK traffic law, so that is extremely unlikely. Far better for community councils to work together with organisations like the Campervan and Motorhome Professional Associtionto develop a more positive, welcoming and beneficial way forward, to Scotlandrsquos benefit.Cameron McNeish, Newtonmore."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11545941.jpg?type=article-full","title":"lotus-sports-car-created-new-cinema-aims-revitalise-highland-town","story":"Now a Lotus sports car is being specially commissioned as part of a new cinema, which the serial entrepreneur behind the project hopes will help boost a Highland townrsquos lockdown recovery.Millionaire businessman Angus MacDonald has footed the entire cost for an independent cinema in Fort William, as a ldquogt to the Lochaber area where he grew up.

ridiculing, or parodying religious beliefs, is a central tenet of both the right to freedom of religion or belief and the right to freedom of expression. This is laid out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Each of the rights contained under these articles contains limitations when there is a genuine societal need to restrict expression. However, offence against religious sentiment does not feature in any of these restrictions. In fact, in , the UN Human Rights Council said \"prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system are incompatible with the Covenant\". This principle applies to all forms of expression, including statements which are critical or disrespectful of religion.Furthermore, it is generally accepted that forbidding dissenting speech against religion promotes religious intolerance rather than protecting adherents. The UNrsquos Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Dr Ahmed Shaheed, made this case strongly saying in  \"when governments restrict freedom of expression on the grounds of ldquoinsult to religion, any peaceful expression of political or religious views is subject to potential prohibition.\"Fraser Sutherland, Chief Executive, Humanist Society Scotland, Edinburgh EH.IS political correctness going to stamp out all satire at the expense of religion in Scotland  No more Billy Connollys. No more Dave Allens. No more Le of Brian. The threat is there in the Hate Crime Bill, which the SNP Government has placed before parliament.Someone isnrsquot a victim of a hate crime because their religious sentiments are hurt or offended. Many people found the jokes of Billy Connolly and Dave Allen \"offensive\", but the law did not rush in to prosecute the offending comedians. Likewise with the film Le of Brian. The right to freedom of speech was considered more important than any injured feelings caused by the satire.In England and Wales, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act  is the counterpart of the Hate Crimes Bill now at Holyrood. In that Act, there is a clear and unambiguous defence of free expression in relation to religion: ldquoNothing in this [legislation] shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a dferent religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.We need the same safeguard written into the Hate Crimes Bill. The law should concern itself with protecting people from hatred, threats and vilication, but it should not extend that into protecting ideas and beliefs. On the contrary, the law should uphold freedom of expression and the liberty to criticise and mock all sorts of ideas and beliefs. That freedom has been hard earned after centuries of censorship and repression.

If we are all considerate to each other’s needs, people will feel safer and go out more, which may reduce loneliness and social isolation and help with their health and wellbeing.”The information sheet has been endorsed by Transport Scotland, Public Health Scotland, Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland as well as Cycling Scotland, Forth Environment Link, Living streets, Paths for All, Ramblers Scotland, Scottish Canals and Sustrans Scotland.To access the information sheet, visit: www.sustrans.org.uk about-us our-work-in-scotland walking-cycling-and-wheeling-during-covid--in-scotland copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From helping to build Nightingale Hospitals to delivering essential supplies to those who are shielding, they have helped thousands of people across the country. We take a look at how one such veteran is helping out.This is not the first time former soldier Joshua Ryder has seen a pandemic close up, having volunteered to visit Sierra Leone during the West African Ebola virus outbreak. The -year-old worked in what was known as a “red zone” in Kerry Town,  miles from capital Freetown.As a member of Royal Army Medical Core, he worked as a combat medical technician, receiving awards for Top Trainee and Adult Learner of the Year.Joshua said: “We treated patients with confirmed or suspected Ebola. The symptoms are similar to those of malaria and gastroenteritis. “We triaged and tested patients to determine whether they had these or Ebola.”The West African outbreak began in , ending in Sierra Leone in .Two-and-a-half years after the first case was discovered, the outbreak resulted in more than , cases with , deaths. vw, px\"  Such was the volatility of the strain – most widespread outbreak of the disease in history – Joshua was only allowed to work in the area for  days.He said: “I loved the country. It has some beautul sights and the people are really friendly. “It was sad to see the devastation caused by the pandemic. We didn’t only focus on the pandemic. We visited orphanages and helped build something for the country.“It was moving to see the children who lost their parents to the virus.”During the coronavirus outbreak he is again working, but the environment could not be more dferent.Having left the army in , he is now a trainee nursing associate on a Midlands Partnership NHS Trust acute mental health ward in Stafford.Joshua, who is father to Tia, aged , and her -year-old sister Lola, said: “Day to day I am more involved with the physical well-being of the patients – calming them, making physical observations, doing ECGs and bloods. “I go to Keele University one day a week and am due to start my second year in September.”It was Joshua’s experiences and expertise in the army that led him to the NHS in general, and mental health in particular.He said: “I have worked in demanding conditions in ious locations around the world. I am adaptable to suit many environments and job roles.” vw, px\"  In the military he saw firsthand soldiers suffering poor mental health. One of his friends, also serving in the army, committed suicide.He said: “I entered the NHS through the Step into Health programme, which has been brilliant.“I have been able to prove myself and have had really positive feedback.“I won an award for Outstanding Impact Since Joining the NHS at the programme’s first ceremony.”Joshua is helping to treat patients through more dficult times than usual.“We are doing absolutely brilliantly,” he said. “It would be abnormal, with all the constant changes,we did not experience stress and anxiety.“We have adapted and made changes.“Here our patients have been brilliant.“We have got a good team here, a good mix of people with dferent skills. We all support each other and do everything we can for our patients.”Joshua has also been a volunteer with men’s mental health charity Men Unite, supporting males in crisis.He ran a half marathon last year to raise £ for Mental Health UK.“And this month I am running  miles, having so far raised £ for the same charity through JustGiving.” he said.Former service personnel have helped dferent communities deal with all manner of problems, making urgent deliveries of food and medicines to vulnerable people while also helping those who are shielding receive what they need.Many others have helped ensure those who need a test for the virus have been able to get one by setting up mobile testing sites, allowing them to run smoothly and safely to daily test thousands of people with symptoms.A lot of this work has required specic skills our veterans have learnt throughout years of military service.The work of these veterans goes to show the military gives you key skills, transferable to civilian le – be it healthcare, business or organisation.Veterans form an important part of our NHS workforce and, throughout COVID-, many more have come forward to support the continued fight against this pandemic.Working across a iety of roles, both on and off the frontline, the NHS has benefitted from their military expertise and experiences, invaluable at this challenging time.From redesigning hospital departments to safely supporting virus and non-virus patients, to providing care for those in Nightingale Hospitals and supporting nurses using military mental health resilience techniques, vets have once again served our country with pride.This is in addition to many who have continued to work in dedicated NHS services for ex-service personnel, such as Veterans’ Mental Health Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service and Veterans’ Mental Health Complex Treatment Service to ensure care and treatment remains available throughout this period, virtually or via phone. vw, px\"  Minister for Defence People and Veterans Johnny Mercer, pictured right, said: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. “We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Officials will have to set out what is the restricted area and for how long it is closed.These decisions must reviewed every seven days.ndash Can I still get fined Yes.People can still be issued with fines of pound, reduced to poundpaid within  days, up to a maximum of pound, for repeat offences or be prosecuted.Officers still have powers to disperse large groups and remove people from an area.ndash How long will the rules last The Regulations expire after six months unless they are scrapped by the Government earlier.But the law requires Health Secretary Matt Hancock to terminate any of the restrictions and requirements as soon as they are considered no longer necessary to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.They must be reviewed every  days and the first review must take place by July .copy -.

It is also hoped to help Shetland#s existing oil and gas industry achieve carbon net zero targets.Plans for the hub are still in early stages with no specic projects agreed. However, ideas such as an offshore wind farm east of Shetland, and the creation of hydrogen from natural gas or electrolysis, are some of the ideas being suggested.Smaller scale community projects would also be developed through the hub project.Mr Irvine#s report to the council said the hub could generate pound billion of revenue for the region, remove carbon emissions by eight million tons, and create , jobs.He said the formative phase would look at which options are viable commercially and which were not.While the council has already committed pound, to the project, Mr Irvine said funding from the Scottish and UK governments as well as the Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be needed.He also said private sector investment was ldquocore to the project ndash and a steering group was working on that.Lerwick North councillor Stephen Leask had questioned how strong the council#s position # and how much financial risk it could face.Mr Irvine said most of the risk would be taken by the major investors from the energy industry, rather than the SIC.Martyn Tulloch, who leads the Net Zero Solution Centre, at OGTC, told the meeting that while other regions were advancing hub projects, with one in Humberside said to be the furthest advanced, he was not aware of any that had received Scottish government funding.#We have been approached by other regions but this is very much our sole focus at the moment,# he added.SIC leader Steven Coutts said the hub was a #crucial# project to Shetland#s future # and one that the council could not progress alone.He added it would need to bring #signicant community benefits# .#We want to see people thrive in Shetland with a strong and resilient community,# he added.Councillors agreed to progress the project into its #formative phase#, which will see the project team work with the energy industry and government agencies to identy next steps, including research projects and trials.Consultations will also take place with the community, businesses and other relevant interestsA funding application is expected to be submitted to the Scottish government next month...Caroline Hepburn, a staff member at both the NAFC Marine Centre and Shetland College, has been awarded the title of #Hidden Hero# in theHighlands and#First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has slammed the UK government#s #shambolic# decision making on air bridges.A programme helping Shetland#s communities #take control of the future of tourism# in their area has been launched.

This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows.

DaoineThe study of areas like Staffin, Tiree and the Western Isles has been labelled as the most comprehensive social survey on the state of Gaelic communities ever conducted.The findings conclude that the language is in crisis, and that within remaining vernacular communities of Scotland the social use and transmission of Gaelic is at the point of collapse.Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands Language Sciences Institute and Soillse, a multi-institutional research collaboration which includes Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in Skye, outline the findings in a new book published todayThe authors of ‘The Gaelic Crisis in the Vernacular Community: A comprehensive sociolinguistic survey of Scottish Gaelic’ urge a radical new agenda and strategy for Gaelic revitalisation in the islands.They argue for the creation of a community development trust for Gaelic-speakers that is island based and under the direct control of the community.Professor Conchúr Ó Giollagáin, Professor of Gaelic Research at the University of the Highlands explained the motivation behind the new book.He said: “It is important that we are clear about the immense scale of the challenges involved in reversing the ongoing decline in the use of Gaelic in these areas.“Our statistical evidence indicates that the Gaelic vernacular community is comprised of around , people, of which a majority are in the  years and over age category.“The decline of the Gaelic community, as especially shown in the marginal practice of Gaelic in families and among teenagers, indicates that without a community-wide revival of Gaelic, the trend towards the loss of vernacular Gaelic will continue.“We found a mismatch between current Gaelic policies and the level of crisis among the speaker group which must be addressed to face the urgency of the language loss in the islands.“The primary focus of Gaelic policy should now be on relevant initiatives to avert the loss of vernacular Gaelic.”In order to make Gaelic policy viable, the researchers called for a re-aligning of national policy to address the decline in the use of Gaelic as a community language.Whilst some elements of national policy have had some success, such as the numbers of primary pupils in Gaelic Medium Education, without an overarching revitalisation approach, as outlined in their research, the authors believe the decline in the Gaelic vernacular community will rapidly continue.Iain Caimbeul, research fellow at the Language Sciences Institute in the University of the Highlands and Islands added: “If Scotland is to continue to give practical expression to its commitment to sustaining cultural ersity, it is vital that strategy for the Gaelic group is rooted in the broader context of community revitalisation.#We hope this research will be valuable to those interested in seeking to sht public policy assumptions from a sole dependence on the school system for creating the next generation of fluent Gaelic speakers.“It is vital that we change the basis for allocating resources to protect against further decline.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience

school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI’ve always been of the opinion that local government should be exempt from the Machiavellian attempts of people whose only agenda is to disrupt the successful running of the ‘machinery’ of administration we all take for granted.Maybe I was naive to expect we’d all be on the same ‘side’, trying our collective best to maximise the opportunities for the people of these Western Isles.I guess too naive.Cue SNP leader, Councillor Gordon Murray’s latest dog-whistle, resulting from last week’s meeting of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.For those who remain oblivious to the frequency at which Facebook Barbara Woodhouse wannabes broadcastMr Murray sometimes operates with an economy of factual accuracy which leaves those who are unprepared to dig # even just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it comes to golf, what you see is generally what you get.At Stornoway last week what we got was decent weather and decent scoring.In the Lewis Cup on Wednesday night, Stuart ‘Tyson’ Campbell triumphed

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  googletag.cmd.push The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said:“As we move throughthe Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety ofpassengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. googletag.cmd.push “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued:“We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is alsoimportant that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.” Further information is available on nidirect at:https:www.nidirect.gov.uk  coronavirus-safer-travel- guidanceandhttps:www.nidirect.gov.uk  face-coverings  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Pride of Orange and Blue Flute Band from Newbuildings will also march with  members registered. Other bands from Coleraine and Limavady have also applied to march. It is anticipated that more could follow in the coming days. The Twelfth is the annualUlsterProtestant celebration held every year on July . googletag.cmd.push However, it is being celebrated on July  this year because the twelfth falls on a Sunday.

The Orange Order cancelled events in April due to the Coronavirus pandemic and asked bands not to parade this year. Harold Henning, Deputy Grand Master, said: This year will be a dferent Twelfthbut just because our parades and gatherings are cancelled, does not mean that we cannot celebrate King William’s momentous victory.Quite the opposite, our challenge is to ensure this Twelfth is marked in style online, in your home, at your door, with families and neighbours.

Her first album was critically acclaimed and she toured the States running shoulders with the A-list. But since ing to Derry in , Noella has sought out a much quieter pace of le and spends a lot of time working for animal welfare charity Friends of Rescue and with her mum Josie who now lives in Culmore Manor. googletag.cmd.push Just before lockdown, Noella released her eagerly anticipated second album Love and Liars.  Any plans for gigs and touring were immediately cancelled, so like many artists she turned to virtual gigs which she streamed through Facebook Live. Noella discovered this new style of performing suited her and set herself a target of raising enough money to buy a camper van to go on the road with her beloved dogs Dolly and Buba. I couldnt leave without them, she said. They are my comfort and my security soIm going anywhere I just have to take them. Theyre my wains. Ive had them since they were born. googletag.cmd.push  Dolly and Bubba join Noella for her virtual concerts and have become a firm fan favourite. They are more famous than me at this stage, laughed Noella. She has also been joined by her sister Jeanette Hutton for some of her performances and in one memorable gig she even visited Culmore Manor where she entertained the residents and duetted with her mum. My mammy is just the best, said Noella. “I go up and see her every day and we talk through the window orits a nice day I can take her outside. I cook for every day. I just love me ma. Noellas Facebook gigs were a hit with fans who tuned in from around the world to hear her songs and have a bit of craic. I feel a lot better sitting in my house and having a laugh with people who want to hear me rather than singing in a pub up the town where you are competing with the noise of a poker machine and people shouting over the top of you, she explained. The only people watching are ones that want to watch. I had to learn cover versions to play in the pubs and it just strips the soul clean out of it. The only reason I learnt to play the guitar was so I could write music. With a healthy balance in her virtual tip jar, Noella started looking for the right vehicle to take her and the wains on the road.While scrolling through Facebook at am, Noella stumbled across her dream vehicle which was up for sale in Belfast. All the campers I had seen were big stupid ugly things with no light and big toilets and showers that took up half the room. But this was perfect. It was all I needed so I messaged the guy and said listen, I want the van. It was only up for five minutes, so it was meant to be. Noella has christened her new van Dorothy and after changing the carpets shes ready to start touring Ireland. Paddy in Rathmor Tyres and Paddy from The Carpet Man sorted me out and now Im ready for the road , said Noella. Im going to live stream from wherever I am, whether its to  people or two people Ill talk about where I am so it will be like a documentary every week.” Shell also use her time on the road to write some new songs. I can feel the songs coming, said Noella. “Maybe  or  of them. I might not write anything for five or six years and then it all comes through.

Since the first official announcement of the post-graduate facility in  , a catalogue of failures has been allowed by the university and decision-makers within government. Impediments almost too numerous to list have acted to frustrate,not block, delivery of what is agreed is a much-needed facility. googletag.cmd.push The responsibility and willingness to bow to problems readily rather than resolve them lies at many doors, not least: politicians, internal university committees, government committees, health officials, Stormont officials, UU officials, other universities, and the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Is there an underlying and more pernicious problem that has its roots in decision-making by UU that is seen to favour other places over Derry  Why are our public representatives facilitating this  Since its establishment in Coleraine by the Stormont government in the s, the university has been allowed, and encouraged, to run an unfettered and unchallenged agenda, whereby major development decided upon by university authorities, based in Belfast, has been centred on Coleraine, Jordanstown and, more recently, North Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The post-GFA era has seen little change and, effectively, Belfast and Stormont, acting as a city-state, exercise a veto on every major development in Derry or the North West. This is the continuation of an unfortunate and deliberate policy which we thought had been consigned to a troubled past. Derry has been patiently lobbying for proper and deserved university provision for the region for  years. It is the last remaining grievance of the Civil Rights era, and the failure to provide a modern university in the North West sustains the injustice practiced by the Unionist government, now long gone, of the time. For almost  years, Direct Rule and devolved governments at Stormont and UU have favoured other localised priorities and broken promises to Derry. In , under the Ilex One Plan, UU and government gave a commitment to have , full-time students at Magee by . The actual number – under , – didn’t change at all over the decade. Most recently, a commitment, endorsed by Dublin and Westminster, to have , students at Magee by  was made in January as part of ‘New Decade New Approach’. Just weeks later, Stormont handed a poundm off-the-books bailout to UU for its well over-budget North Belfast campus, while simultaneously putting a freeze on Derry development. The city and the region are either the collateral damage of flawed strategic planning or dismissive indference to any regional equality and provision. It has to be one or the other and when you dismiss a region, you dismiss the people who live there. Given the inequitable outcomes flowing from policy-making pursued by a university with government money for almost  years now, it would, in a normal society, merit a full public inquiry. Local representatives and most worryingly, nationalist politicians, who would have traditionally questioned the policy, are failing to alter what is undeniably UU’s ‘Belfast-first’ agenda - to the huge detriment of northwest Ireland which has still, by far, the lowest Higher Education provision on these islands. Derry University Group figures recently put the HE uptake in Derry at fty percent lower than the next lowest in Ireland. The medical school,and when it arrives, is barely a fig leaf to cover UU’s embarrassment, and Stormont’s shame, at how they have treated Derry. It will house just  students – and the capital costs will be financed not by the university, nor central government, nor Stormont, but by the city-region itself from its City Deal package. Despite having failed utterly, and consistently, in its responsibilities to this region, UU stands to become the biggest single beneficiary of the City Deal. Stormont will not, however, underwrite the on-going running costs of the new Derry facility, on the grounds that UU – having spent all its money, and much more besides, in Belfast - is now for all intents and purposes, insolvent. In recent years, following lobbying by the Derry University Group and others, the Dublin government has stated that it is prepared to help lead university development in Derry and northwest Ireland – a promise, indeed, that is reinforced in its new Programme for Government. It is time to make good on that promise. Representative democracy and investment cannot be the trickle-down preserve of just one geographical area or one demographic community. Such presents as unbalanced economic, educational, social and cultural polarisation. It is a poor and failed model for regeneration especially now, given the possible economic and social repercussions of Covid-. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a constituent college of the National University, is ideally placed to develop and deliver a medical school in the North West, and can do so rapidly. RCSI currently runs two medical school campuses in Malaysia and another in Bahrain. A new cross-border facility in the North West, operated by RCSI and overseen by the Irish and British governments directly as part of the North-South institutions, would short circuit the bureaucratic and financial logjams at Stormont and UU. It would also provide a starting blueprint for a new, autonomous cross-border university for Derry and Donegal, which ultimately is the only viable solution to the HE crisis here. It is time to put the North West first and allow us to develop our higher education sector independently, away from the grip of centralised decision-makers.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

A spokesperson for St. Columb’s College encouraged people to get involved today. “Both of these young men are sadly missed by staff and students at the College. “Oran was a pleasant young man - a true gentleman in the making. He was a conscientious student who was respected by staff and peers alike. Outside of school, he played an active role in his local GAA club and enjoyed socialising with friends when not working on cars with his father. googletag.cmd.push “Oran showed extreme courage and faith throughout his illness and his loss has left its mark on those who remember him fondly. “Aodhaacuten was such a genuine, lovely person and brought a smile to everyone he was around.

Family, friends and team mates held him in high esteem and he is sorely missed by us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable.

In this his third series, Joe s with another fascinating set of programmes celebrating the mighty achievements of the past that have transformed our daily living and reveals the cutting-edge technology that is shaping the future of our infrastructure.With the help of the experts in their respective fields, Joe reveals the stories behind some of Northern Irelandrsquos well-known landmarks and also sheds light on how civil engineering is in operation quite literally beneath our feet!Get ready to go salt mining, quarry blasting, castle roofing, engine restoring, road surfacing and flood preventing to name a few of the activities that Joe gets involved with in this series.In the opening episode which airs next Monday night at pm, Joe visits Delamont which nestles on the shores of the internationally acclaimed waterway.The country park is home to the largest monolith or standing stone in the UK and Ireland, with the signicant landmark standing  metres tall and weighing in at almost  tonnes.Ancient civilisations throughout the world marked important occasions and cosmic events by erecting megaliths, often in circles or other formations, but sometimes as free-standing monoliths. There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone. Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.Anyone unable to tune in next Monday night can watch the programme on www.itv utvprogrammes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"MP calls for Ancient East tour region to include Down  ","story":"MARKETING a large swathe of East Down on an all-island basis would help produce a signicant boost for local tourism, according to South Down MP Chris Hazzard.He has asked Stormont tourism minister Diane Dodds to work with tourism agencies on either side of the border to extend Irelandrsquos Ancient East Tourism region to include a large part of Down District.Mr Hazzard was responding to the publication of the tourism ministerrsquos lsquoeconomic recovery strategyrsquo and believes that such a move would help the South Down tourism industry recover from Covid- and help mitigate ldquothe looming Brexit shock.Mr Hazzard argues that itrsquos ldquoludicrous that Failte Irelandrsquos lsquoAncient Eastrsquo tourism region stops in Louth, excluding the historically signicant north-east region of the island.He said that a large part of East Down was the playground for Cuacute Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill ldquowith the landscape forever marked by St Patrickrsquos legacy, surrounded by shoreline that welcomed Vikings, Planters and the Normans.The MP said that in Downpatrick, there are the graves of the patron saint and Viking King Magnus.He continued: ldquoWe have the impressive Downpatrick and Co Down Railway Museum, the only working heritage railway in the North which stretches out to the historic Inch Abbey.ldquoUnder the shadow of Down Cathedral, we have the only St Patrickrsquos visitor exhibition in the world, with the nearby Down County Museum located in the historic buildings of the th century gaol where United Irish leader, Thomas Russell, was executed in .Mr Hazzard said the northern side of Downpatrick was surrounded by the Mound of Down, Finnebrogue Wood and the stunning Quoile Nature Reserve, with Delamont Country Park completing the short journey to the shores of Strangford Lough where the Vikings first landed.ldquoTo the east lies Struell Wells and St Patrickrsquos first church at Saul, a unique site known widely as the cradle of christianity in Ireland, the MP continued, insisting it is ldquosimply unacceptable that this rich heritage would be a victim of partitionism of the very worst kind.Mr Hazzard said local tourism providers had been hit hard by the Covid- pandemic, with many very worried about the impact of Brexit and ldquoneedless bureaucratic hurdles.He continued: ldquoUndoubtedly, they need to be supported in the years ahead and I have have written to the tourism minister asking her to look seriously at this opportunity.ldquoNow is the time to extend the lsquoAncient Eastrsquo region and also the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route into the north to encompass all that is worth seeing on the island of Ireland.He added: ldquoQuite simply, it is the best way to successfully mitigate the impact of Covid- and Brexit on the local tourism industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"New president appointed at Downpatrick Lions Club  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK Lions Club has appointed Raymond Crea as its new president.Mr Crea succeeds Mr John Dennis, who presented him with his chain of office during a socially-distanced handover.Reflecting on his year in office, John said that while it was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, it was nevertheless rewarding, thanking his fellow club members and wider public for their enthusiasm and support.Mr Crea said he was delighted to take over an important role at the helm of the organisation.He said he looked forward to finding new ways to raise funds in what he described as ldquochallenging times for numerous charities that Downpatrick Lions support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul  climbs world’s toughest peaks  ","story":"FOR most of us sleeping on a narrow bed suspended hundreds of metres high off El Capitan, Calorniarsquos famous vertical rock wall in Yosemite Valley, would be utterly fear-inducing.Not so for mountain guide and expert rock climber Paul Swail, who first discovered his love of mountains growing up in Newcastle at the foot of the Mournes.For the  year-old, itrsquos the best nightrsquos sleep ever.ldquoYou get the most amazing nightrsquos sleep in one of those, said Paul, referring to a piece of equipment called a portaledge where rock climbers sleep and eat in during a long climb.ldquoWe spent six days climbing one of the El Cap routes and we didnrsquot want to get out of our beds in the morning.ldquoYes, we were knackered but itrsquos the comfiest thing you will ever sleep on. With all the fresh air and seeing the stars at night, when you wake up, all you can see is the ground hundreds of metres below you, itrsquos just amazing.Paul now lives in Chamonix at the foot of Mont Blanc in the French Alps with his English we, Ellie, and toddler son Luca. Luca was only weeks old when his parents climbed Slieve Donard on a trip home with him safely tucked inside a sling on his fatherrsquos chest.Hersquos enjoying his time lsquorestingrsquo from his day job of guiding people on challenging climbs of the Alpsrsquo highest peaks of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and the Eiger to spend time with his son.Depending on the mountain, he guides either one or two people up the peaks and safely down again.Paul explained: ldquoThe people who hire me are time poor but money rich. They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

on public transport from july  ","story":"FACE coverings will become mandatory on public transport from Friday July  as part of the recovery process from Covid-, to support efforts to reduce the risk of transmission. From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faeccfdbaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbcad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
