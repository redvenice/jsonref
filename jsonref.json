[{"url":null,"title":"PIERS MORGAN Harry Meghan brought negative press yourselves","story":"Share this article I suspect this staggeringly privileged multi-millionaire prince\u0027s main worry each morning is instructing his servants in his palatial home as to how he wants his breakfast eggs cooked.But when you marry a Hollywood actress, then unfortunately, this kind of pathetic woe-is-me-me-me attitude often comes with the territory.In the next part of his statement, Harry really upped the pity ante, invoking the memory of his late mother Princess Diana.\u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027Wow.I understand why Harry dislikes the press after what happened to his mother, truly I do.Her death must have been incredibly hard for him to take as a 12-year-old boy.But let\u0027s be very clear - the press didn\u0027t kill Diana, a speeding drunk-driver killed Diana.And if she hadn\u0027t recklessly abandoned her usual royal protection officers and drivers, she\u0027d probably still be alive today.         Prince Harry, and Meghan pose with their newborn son Archie on May 8 this year. The Duke of Sussex accused the press of \u0027bullying\u0027 and \u0027relentless propaganda\u0027Yes, she was the subject of huge press attention, but speaking from personal experience as a newspaper editor at the time, I can assure you she played the media game just as ruthlessly as we played it with her.She was the biggest star in the world, and would happily and regularly collude with the papers when it suited her – just as Meghan happily and regularly colludes with magazines like People and Vogue when it suits her.But with all due respect to Ms Markle, she\u0027s not in the same league as Diana in terms of fame.So for Harry to compare them in this way is both wrong and slightly distasteful. (And before the inevitable howls of \u0027you\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s like to lose a parent young\u0027 pour in, let me just point out that my father died when I was very young.)         Meghan was guest editor of September\u0027s Vogue, dedicating it to 15 \u0027fearless women,\u0027 including Jane Fonda, Jacinda Ardern and Greta ThunbergHe added that he has been \u0027witness to her private suffering for too long\u0027 and \u0027to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u0027Hmmm.It was only a few weeks ago that Meghan was telling people at a function that she never reads any press about herself. So how would she know what the press is saying, let alone suffer from it?As I\u0027ve often said, I have little time for Meghan after she ghosted me as a friend the moment she first met Harry. It signified a worrying social-climbing character trait that has seen her ditch many friends and almost all her family if she feels they may threaten her ferociously ambitious rise up the celebrity ladder.But what I think of her personally is irrelevant to the situation that actually sparked this battle with the media, and that is the breakdown of her relationship with her father.There\u0027s no doubt that Thomas Markle made a big mistake in stunting photos with the paparazzi before his daughter\u0027s wedding, as he has admitted himself.But did that really warrant him being banished forever in such a heartless manner?It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that Harry has never met his father-in-law, and that Meghan has now cut him out of her life.         Harry referenced his mother Princess Diana in his statement: \u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027 He is seen above with her and Prince William I\u0027ve interviewed Thomas several times and found him to be a very normal and nice, if naïve, guy who just had no idea how to handle the massive vicarious fame that instantly came his way after Meghan announced she was engaged to a British Prince.Rather then help him, they savagely punished him for a silly mistake, and his erratic behaviour ever since suggests a father deeply hurt and bemused by losing any contact with the daughter he brought up with such love and care.Thomas Markle gave Meghan\u0027s letter to the Mail on Sunday because he wanted to correct what he believed was misleading criticism of him in People magazine from Meghan\u0027s friends.Judge him all you like for it, but imagine how tough the past few years have been for him too? He has never even met his own grandchild.Thomas has been no angel in this family wrangle, but nor is he the devil.And he should be allowed the freedom of speech to defend himself.Rather than going to war with the press in this absurd manner, Harry should clamber down off his hysterical hothead high horse and repair the real running sore causing Meghan\u0027s distress – by making peace with her father. "},{"url":null,"title":"Helen Mirrens ancestor one Catherine Greats ruthless generals","story":"Share this article The 74-year-old Oscar winner’s links to Russia – she was born Ilyena Lydia Vasilievna Mironova – are well known, but the close connection to Catherine herself was obscured until now. Under Catherine’s rule, Count Mikhail won countless military battles and fought to annex Crimea, rout the Turks, and suppress the Poles.Yet his errant behaviour led Catherine to nickname him ‘crazy Kamensky’ and one contemporary account described him as \u0027rude and cruel, biting his soldiers on manoeuvres (and) tearing pieces of meat out with his teeth\u0027.In harsh winters he \u0027ordered prisoners to undress and poured water over them until they froze\u0027.Despite his brutal behaviour, he was entrusted to such a degree that he became a mentor to Catherine’s son Peter, according to historian Yuri Sinjugin.\u0027She even let him visit her heir, who liked to listen to his stories about Russian military valour,’ he said.His wife Anna Shcherbatova was a princess in her own right and a noted socialite in the royal capital of St Petersburg.While Count Mikhail is not recorded as one of Catherine\u0027s multiple sexual conquests at court, they nevertheless had a close but tempestuous relationship.This culminated immediately after Potemkin\u0027s death, when Mirren\u0027s ancestor seized control of the Russian army but was rapidly slapped down by Catherine for \u0027being naughty\u0027.

Carnet discovered that it was in fact the last remaining 19th-century vespasienne urinal in the city. He decided he needed to save it.“It no longer conforms to the comfort standards of today,” he says of the urinal (an understatement). “But it’s a piece of heritage and it’s in a terrible state in the middle of the boulevard – it’s not possible to just leave it like that.”The urinal is “part of the great Parisian history of public sanitation,” he says, though he admits he’s never used it himself. “The participatory budget is an opportunity to give it a second youth.”Carnet’s project was one of 430 that went to public vote between 6 September and 22 September this year. Sadly for him, the vespasienne was not one of the 11 major projects and 183 smaller propositions that earned enough votes to become reality. Instead, Parisians chose projects that ranged from better recycling facilities to upgraded cycling infrastructure to programmes to help women who are experiencing homelessness.More than 140,000 people voted in the scheme, the sixth (and possibly last) time residents have been able to choose how the administration of mayor Anne Hidalgo spends a significant portion of its money.As usual, while the quixotic propositions tend to garner attention during the voting stage, it is the serious improvements to the city that tend to get funded, such as the €1.5m plan to upgrade cleaning facilities that won more than 37,000 votes last year, or the decision to send funds to a temporary migrant camp built on the outskirts of the city at the height of refugee arrivals to Europe.Paris’s deputy mayor for local democracy, Pauline Véron, says the vast majority of projects “aren’t bizarre or complicated – they’re serious. They can be original, a bit new or innovative, but they’re not harebrained.”The scheme was launched when Hidalgo came to power in 2014. At €45 per inhabitant, Véron says Paris runs the largest per capita participatory budget in the world. Overall, more than 1,800 inidual city improvements have been realised thanks to the public vote, Véron says.Thousands of proposals are submitted each year and must pass a feasibility study before qualifying for the vote. A plan to bulldoze Sacré-Coeur on the basis that it was an insult to the legacy of the 1871 Paris Commune was famously disqualified at this stage in 2017. (The city demurred not because the project would involve the permanent destruction of one of the most famous buildings in the world, but because the church belonged to the Archdiocese of Paris, and was hence outside its jurisdiction.)The programme was inspired by the city of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil, which successfully introduced a participatory budget in 1989 to tackle its rampant inequality. It is with the redistributive spirit of Porto Alegre in mind that Paris specifically allocates €30m of its participatory budget to working-class areas, Véron says.Despite this, the Paris incarnation lacks the radical spirit of the Brazilian scheme, says Gilles Pradeau, who is writing his PhD on participatory budgets at the University of Westminster. He notes that while a large part of the Porto Alegre budget was decided by residents, “what is critical in Paris about the making of the city is not done through participatory budgeting”.Still, the Paris scheme and one launched in Lisbon in 2008 have helped kick off a wave of imitators across Europe – similar projects are under way in Milan, Glasgow and Madrid. In France, the number of participatory budgets has doubled each year since 2014.With city elections set for March next year, it is not certain that Paris’s participatory budget will survive if Hidalgo, who has not yet announced her candidacy but who is widely expected to run, does not win re-election.Whatever happens in 2020, Véron says the budget will be an important part of Hidalgo’s legacy.And if the legacy of the last vespasienne in Paris still hangs in the balance, public urination did get a boost this year: a €240,000 proposal to install designer urinals along the Canal Saint Martin will now go ahead, thanks to the votes of more than 2,000 impatient Parisians.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7100613ee132932ba9cfff24776c9b789e5a1/0_223_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f27db8fb814383c3b82ea22905cc44","title":"10 timeless fashion trends that never date","story":"Iconic staples rule the catwalk this season.

But, once again, the Conservatives are talking only to themselves, not to Ireland and the EUBoris Johnson has reached for the word compromise many times in the last two days as he has promoted his new Brexit proposals. There were three mentions of compromise in his party conference speech in Manchester on Wednesday, a further four in his letter to the European commission, two in the statement he delivered to MPs at Westminster on Thursday and several others in the exchanges that followed.These usages, although tendentious, are not wholly specious. Mr Johnson’s proposals are an attempt to bridge the gap between the EU-UK withdrawal agreement signed by Theresa May last year and the root-and-branch rejection of that agreement by the Conservative party’s most dogmatic pro-Brexit faction. Setting aside the fact that Mr Johnson himself voted for that agreement in March, the prime minister has moved the dial a few notches from his previous determination to get rid of the Northern Ireland backstop in its entirety.However, the new proposals are not a compromise with the European Union, which is the body with which he ought to be seeking a deal. They are a compromise with the Democratic Unionist party. Mr Johnson has courted the DUP more assiduously than even Mrs May did. He has spoken at their conferences, invited them into Downing Street and generally gone the extra mile to find ways of appeasing their demands that Northern Ireland should not be treated differently from the rest of the UK. The compromise Mr Johnson has now made with the DUP allows him to say that there can be some all-Ireland regulations for a limited period – which would mean Britain and Northern Ireland leaving on different terms – while the DUP has secured an effective veto over their further continuation, thus ensuring that Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory in the longer term. But they are talking to themselves, not to the wider polities of Ireland, Britain or Europe.Mr Johnson ignores three huge issues. The first is that the DUP does not speak for Northern Ireland, whose people voted to remain in the EU in 2016 and where opinion polls regularly show support for the backstop and for separate treatment for Northern Ireland to preserve the all-Ireland economy. By allowing the DUP to act as if it is the government of Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson ignores the majority that oppose the DUP’s pro-Brexit stance and mounting evidence that the DUP is now losing the hegemony that it used to enjoy. Giving a decisive role to Northern Ireland institutions that are suspended for intractable reasons solves nothing (and triggers the demand from Scotland that their devolved institutions should get a veto too). It suggests Mr Johnson might not be able to make his deal stick, even if the EU agreed to it.The second problem is that Mr Johnson’s plans renege on the principles, and legally rooted treaty guarantees, of north-south cooperation that have been the bedrock of the increasingly precarious Northern Ireland peace process. Preserving the BelfastGood Friday agreement was at the core of Mrs May’s approach. It is part of the EU (Withdrawal) Act itself that the UK will not create any form of “physical infrastructure” for border arrangements after Brexit. The reason why there is a backstop at all is because the May government took these promises seriously. Like so many English Tories in the past and today, Mr Johnson simply does not share that sense of responsibility. His plans betray Britain’s solemn promise and ignore the consequences for Ireland.The final problem is that the vagueness of Mr Johnson’s plans leaves a hole in the EU single market without proposing a workable solution. Controls of any kind are inconsistent with the principle of frictionless trade, while loose controls threaten rules and protections for consumers. It is typical of Mr Johnson and the hardliners that they have failed to engage with these realities at all.Yet the realities are immutable. Britain has profound legal and political obligations to the people of Ireland. Britain has deep moral obligations too. None of these are upheld in the government’s new proposals or by the untrustworthy way Britain behaves on the Irish and European stage. Mr Johnson calls it compromise. It should be called perfidy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c69a2395edda617d7972aeb757d6b97b5c113080/0_74_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c054111c213503b2d970f3ab21fcffb1","title":"jeremy corbyn mps labour leader legitimacy","story":"Many MPs are in denial, refusing to accept the Labour leader’s legitimacy. Yet he is the only one who can prevent Boris Johnson trashing BritainDeparting Tory leaders have developed an odd and presumptuous habit of demanding that the leader of the opposition resign too. “As a party leader who has accepted when her time was up,” Theresa May told Jeremy Corbyn in her final prime minister’s questions, preparing to leave her party to Boris Johnson and the country without a prayer, “perhaps the time has come for him to do the same.”In 2016, David Cameron – who had called a referendum lost it, only to then break his promise and abandon the country in a moment of self-inflicted crisis – suggested Corbyn’s resignation would be a patriotic act. “It might be in my party’s interest for him to sit there. It’s not in the national interest. I would say, for heaven’s sake, man, go.”Stranger still, many Labour parliamentarians agreed with them: Cameron’s speech took place in the middle of a full-blown, if woefully inept, coup.When the 2017 exit polls on election night suggested that Labour had far exceeded expectations, increasing its vote share and seats while the Tories lost their majority, a BBC documentary showed the muted response of several Labour MPs. They were shocked not into jubilation, but silence they had looked forward to his defeat, removal and “party renewal” even if it meant they had to go down with him. The former leader Tony Blair, meanwhile, put his head in his hands and said he didn’t understand this country any more.The political and media establishments are still struggling with the choice the Labour party made in 2015. The fact that the decision was emphatic, had to be made twice following the failed coup, and was effectively endorsed by the electorate in 2017, has not been enough. On some level, that goes beyond the political to the psychological: they refuse to accept his tenure as legitimate.This sense of denial runs deep – as though insisting he should not be the party leader in effect means he’s not. It is a delusion that recalls the author Doris Lessing’s observation of Blair’s declarative approach to politics: “He believes in magic. That if you say a thing it is true.”Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party. He has a mandate. He represents something other than just himself. That is not a statement of opinion but of fact. One does not have to like it to accept it. But the failure to accept it will have material and strategic consequences. And, with a general election imminent and the future of the country’s relationship with Europe finely balanced, the moment of reckoning with that fact is long overdue. For there is no route to a second referendum without Labour there is no means of defeating Johnson without Labour. The party remains the largest, and by far the most effective, electoral obstacle to most of the immediate crises that progressives wish to prevent. Once again that is not a case for Corbyn or for Labour, but for reality.Earlier this week, when asked which was worse, a no-deal Brexit or Corbyn as prime minister, the Liberal Democrats’ Scotland spokesman, Jamie Stone, said: “It may be that somebody else may emerge from the Labour party. I think the ball is very much in the Labour party’s court to see what alternatives they could find.”That is not going to happen. Liberal Democrats don’t get to choose the Labour leader. Labour does. The Lib Dems have long struggled to understand this. In 2010 Nick Clegg said he could work with Labour, just not Gordon Brown. Two years later they said they could work with Labour but the shadow chancellor Ed Balls must go.The insistence that Labour couldn’t get the numbers in parliament to oust Johnson and make Corbyn a caretaker prime minister is a self-fulfilling prophecy made most ardently by those who won’t give him the numbers. But even if it wasn’t, it is a fallacy to assume that anyone else would get any closer. When pressed on which he would prefer – “Is it Jeremy Corbyn or is it no deal?” – Stone eventually showed his cards. “It is no deal every time.”There is candour in this. It is effectively the position of his party and many others, including a few disgruntled Labour members, for whom a potential Labour government under Corbyn is somehow worse than the actual no-deal Brexit under Johnson that may soon happen. But there is a clear contradiction too. Some of those who have devoted the past few years to stopping any kind of Brexit now claim that the only thing worse than a no-deal Brexit – the worst kind of Brexit they could possibly imagine – is the leader of the only party that can stop a no-deal Brexit.None of this is a reason to necessarily support Labour or Corbyn. There are all sorts of reasons, from antisemitism to an insufficiently pro-European stance, as to why progressives might decide not to back Labour at this moment and the calculations are very different outside England and in those areas where tactical voting offers the best hope of getting rid of Conservatives. And given the redistributive agenda that Labour laid out at last week’s conference, there are all sorts of reasons why progressives might back it, too.Political parties are not entitled to anyone’s support. They must earn it. The moment they start blaming voters for not supporting them, they are sunk. That’s as true for Labour under Corbyn as it was for the US Democrats under nominee Al Gore. But that does not absolve the voter from the strategic and moral responsibility of accounting for their vote.In the second round of the French presidential elections in 2002, which pitted the conservative Jacques Chirac against the far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, a Communist party local councillor, François Giacalone, voted for the conservative. “When the house is on fire,” he said, “you don’t care too much if the water you put it out with is dirty.”Right now, the house is on fire. Johnson’s first couple of months in office have illustrated that what’s at stake is not a contest between bad and worse. This is a leader who uses the police as props breaks the law to undermine democracy and stokes ision with rhetoric that can and has been easily co-opted by the far right, pitting a section of the population against parliament and the judiciary. Johnson’s cabinet and its agenda, both with regards to Brexit and beyond, do not represent a mere shift to the right but a paradigmatic sea-change in British politics that, where Europe is concerned, may have irreversible consequences.Those who last year were literally on the fringe of the Tory party conference have this week been running the show. The coming election will not just be about opposing Brexit – it’ll be about defending democratic norms. The key consequence of understanding that Corbyn is the legitimate leader of the Labour party is understanding that this fire cannot be extinguished without him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345ccae4cfd7c6b8ffde1e378817325efa9dda44/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=2500\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84a4a5ba7211846c713d736d1e2a8836 5000w","title":"galleries brunches bars and boutiques a locals guide to torontos coolest neighbourhoods","story":"From Queen Street West to Leslieville and Riverdale in the east end, Toronto’s coolest neighbourhoods are home to some of North America’s most happening restaurants, watering holes and cultural hotspotsToronto is booming – pulsing with energy, from its homegrown art scene and its erse culinary offerings to its status as one of North America’s style capitals. Rivalling New York City and LA, Toronto’s become a new premier destination for millennials curious to discover its thriving arts, culture, fashion and dining scenes.After taking in some of the top-tier downtown attractions, such as the CN Tower, head over to nearby Kensington Market. Spanning only a few blocks, the streets lined with outdoor fruit markets, musicians and local craft boutiques are emblematic of Toronto’s erse spirit.From Mexican to Japanese food, the market is a culinary beast. It’s home to Toronto’s best-rated taco shop, Seven Lives, where you can snatch a spot in line and grab a combo of three fish, octopus or shrimp tacos for less than £10.

Instead, try and get lost in the more erse and culturally immersive areas in the city, like Kensington Market.’ Lorena Agolli, Sole Survivor ownerMore or less everyone in Toronto can agree that Riverdale and the adjacent neighbourhood of Leslieville are having a moment. While most of this guide features hotspots in the west end, the sweeping views of the skyline and flourishing culinary scene puts this east end spot on the map.Toronto’s appetite for brunch is huge – and its menus reflect the city’s status as one of the most erse in the world, fusing cultures, ingredients and techniques from across the globe. Leslieville knows its way around a brunch better than pretty much anywhere else in Toronto. Lady Marmalade, a long-time local gem for all-day breakfast, has featured in the top 10 eggs benedict in the city since it opened in 2005. Mixing traditional and Mexican-inspired dishes, the bright, airy space combines local hospitality with a touch of elegance.For lunch, the Real Jerk, which was the filming location for Drake and Rihanna’s music video for Work, is a family-run, unassuming spot for some of the city’s best West Indian cuisine. Finally, Ascari Enoteca, named after 1950s Italian racing legend Alberto Ascari, is a Leslieville favourite. Serving up plates of handmade pasta paired with perfect wine matches, it’s known as the date-night spot by neighbourhood denizens.If you’re heading back to the area for some fun after dark, the hottest spot at the moment is the Rooftop Bar at the Broadview Hotel. Housed in a historic building dating back to 1891, this newly renovated space, featuring industrial chic decorative touches, offers unmatched views of the city skyline. Another hotspot is the Vatican Gift Shop, where patrons step through a secret door, in what from the outside appears to be an unassuming storefront, into a neon-lit basement speakeasy to enjoy live music and a cocktail (or two).Get artsy on Queen Street West. From its independent galleries and hip bars to high-end boutiques, this street, which stretches from Roncesvalles to central Toronto, is an urban trekker’s dream.

For the crowd, head to the Drake Hotel, where parties are held across three levels (basement to rooftop bar) each weekend. For something less flashy, a 10-minute walk north to Dundas Street West brings you to Cocktail Bar, where delicious cocktails meet refined snacks. Finally, bring your A-game to Apartment 200 — perhaps the city’s trendiest bar, where Toronto’s top DJs go for a spin.Toronto has one of the world’s biggest Chinatowns, so it’s no surprise that it’s a fixture of the city. Chinatown is a fine option for planning a day excursion filled with activities. Start off with selfies at the Art Gallery of Ontario, especially with the world-acclaimed Yayoi Kusama Infinity Mirrors installation.

When plants, insects and fungi are added, one in seven of the 8,400 UK species assessed are at risk of being completely lost, with 133 already gone since 1500.The causes of the losses are the intensification of farming, pollution from fertiliser, manure and plastic, the destruction of habitats for houses, the climate crisis and invasive alien species. The State of Nature report shows no significant improvement since the last one in 2016, which said the UK was “among the most nature-depleted countries in the world”.The losses mirror the global annihilation of wildlife, which scientists suggest is the start of the sixth mass extinction on Earth and is undermining the natural life-support systems that humanity relies on for air, water and food.“We know more about the UK’s wildlife than any other country on the planet, and what it is telling us should make us sit up and listen,” said Daniel Hayhow of the RSPB, the lead author of the report. “We need to respond more urgently across the board.”Sophie Pavelle, a young conservationist who contributed to the report’s foreword, said: “I have felt the loss of nature more acutely this year than any other. A dawn chorus less deafening hedgerows less frantic bizarre, worrying weather. It seems that in a more complex world, nature is tired, muted and confused.”Paul de Zylva of Friends of the Earth said: “As we lose nature, we lose a huge part of what makes us happy and healthy. UK ministers and businesses persist in planning and funding disastrous projects and practices, often with public money.” Repeated declarations by the government to halt and reverse the decline of nature have not been followed by matching action, he said.The report uses assessments from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list to assess the number of UK species at risk of extinction. As well as mammals and birds, it found 440 plants, 405 invertebrates and 232 fungi and lichen in dangerThe mammals most at risk are the Scottish wildcat and the once-widespread black rat, but hedgehogs, rabbits and water voles are also falling in numbers. “I have never seen a hedgehog, although my parents used to see them all the time in this area,” said James Miller, another young conservationist featured in the report.“But it is not all gloom and doom,” said Gary Powney, of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, a contributor to the report. “There are inspirational conservation success stories, where people have come together to protect and restore wildlife.”The fen raft spider was threatened with extinction in the UK, he said, but the Wildlife Trusts worked with the EU to fund habitat restoration and the species was increasing. Other successes include the saving of corncrakes and bitterns, the large blue butterfly and the return of otters to less polluted waters.The report uses many millions of data records from tens of thousands of expert volunteers. “We need even more people to get involved and record the bioersity around them, so we can monitor the health of our countryside,” said Powney.Rosie Hails of the National Trust said: “It’s not just government that needs to act we can also all do our own bit, including nature-friendly planting in our backyards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d582b15731fab0fcb3b42f9f6f5266e47b641c8f/0_59_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed363605ae1789e934146554eec9eaa","title":"monster fatberg autopsy reveals wet wipes bones and false teeth","story":"Fatberg found in Sidmouth, Devon, contained no toxic chemicals or microplastic beads The dirty secrets of a huge fatberg discovered lurking under the seafront of a Devon town have been laid bare after scientists carried out an “autopsy” of the monster.As expected, household cooking fats, wet wipes and other hygiene products were key components of the 64m-long beast (bigger than the Leaning Tower of Pisa) but it also contained bits of bone, twigs, string – and false teeth.Happily, it did not contain any detectable levels of toxic chemicals, and the scientists who examined lumps of it could not apportion blame for it to any particular businesses, neighbourhoods or groups. It appears to have been very much a community effort.Campaigns to educate people about how not to feed fatbergs take pains to remind us that toilets and sinks are not “magic portals”. There is a simple set of rules for the bathroom: stick to flushing the three Ps: pee, poo and (toilet) paper. Everything else – sanitary towels, nappies, cotton buds, condoms, dental floss, used plasters and whatever else you might think to chuck down the toilet – should go into the bin.Just because a product says it is flushable doesn’t mean that it is biodegradable. Baby wipes might be a godsend to parents, but not to Victorian-era sewerage systems. Wipes marketed as flushable will probably be able to make their way down your toilet, but will eventually clog up the pipes further along their journey.The kitchen is another area of concern. Water companies are keen to bust the myth that running hot water and pouring washing-up liquid down the sink ahead of fats, oils or grease will stop it building up and blocking the pipes. Their recommendation is to keep a small container, such as an old margarine tub, to hand in your kitchen, into which you can pour oil and fat before safely disposing of it in the bin.The fatberg was discovered under The Esplanade in Sidmouth, a few metres from the sea, by South West Water just before Christmas last year and made headlines around the world.In February a hardy bunch of workers donned breathing apparatus to begin the painstaking process of hacking the fatberg into small pieces and removing it from the sewer. It took eight weeks and the monster was carted away in 36 tankers.A team of scientists from the University of Exeter were given the scarcely less enviable job of carrying out the autopsy to establish how it came into being and whether it posed environmental risks.The scientists were given four 10kg samples from the fatberg, which smelled like a heady combination of rotting meat and an unclean toilet. They melted the chunks and then combed through them by hand before subjecting samples to forensic analysis.The team found that the samples they received were mostly made of animal fats consistent with domestic food preparation combined with household hygiene products such as wet wipes and sanitary products, as well as natural and artificial fibres from toilet tissues and laundry.Crucially, the team found the fatberg contained no detectable levels of toxic chemicals, meaning its presence in the sewer did not pose a chemical or biological risk to the environment or human health.Prof John Love, a synthetic biology expert at the University of Exeter, said: “We worried that the fatberg might concentrate fat-soluble chemicals such as those found in contraceptives, contain now-banned microplastic beads from cosmetics and be rich in potentially pathogenic microbes, but we found no trace of these possible dangers.“We were all rather surprised to find that this Sidmouth fatberg was simply a lump of fat aggregated with wet wipes, sanitary towels and other household products that really should be put in the bin and not down the toilet. The microfibres we did find probably came from toilet tissue and laundry, and the bacteria were those we would normally associate with a sewer.”Scientists from the Greenpeace laboratory, based at the university’s Streatham Campus, also looked at the chemical composition of the fatberg. The results suggested that the fats found were more in keeping with domestic food preparation than commercial food outlets, while the chemicals were those found in personal care products rather than pharmaceuticals or pesticides.Nicky Cunningham, the manager for the Centre for Resilience in Environment, Water and Waste, said: “The results indicate that there isn’t a single contributing factor or demographic responsible for this fatberg coming to being.”South West Water’s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said: “Although we deal with around 8,500 blocked sewers every year, the Sidmouth fatberg was by far the largest discovered in our service history. We wanted to learn as much as we could about it, how it was created and what it was made of to help us avoid further fatbergs in future.“We will be using these results to help us educate, inform and change the behaviours of people in terms of what they are putting down the toilet and sink. That’s not just applicable to Sidmouth but across our region.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52dc08762e38ed327c927a97d4ae471d7efc8b01/557_114_2687_1613/master/2687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5ca1a74449633e222e99382fe0e1b3f","title":"gold liner liquid lipstick and eyelash glue precision drag queen tips for everyday makeup","story":"As RuPaul’s Drag Race comes to British TV, former contestants share their makeup dos and don’t’s, from time-saving tricks to lipsticks that stay putAfter 10 years of RuPaul’s Drag Race bringing drag culture to mainstream TV audiences, the UK is getting its own version of the show, filled with British “charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent” – and, of course, makeup. Drag queens are known for their exaggerated makeup: false eyelashes, bold brows and extreme contouring are all commonplace. So, too, is a lot of glitter (and to do Drag Race shimmer sustainably see options here and here). Importantly, whether comical, cartoonish or comparatively subtle, drag makeup is always on point. Here are the tips and tricks that translate from the werk room into everyday makeup looks, according to former Drag Race contestants.It sounds like a cliche, but good makeup starts with good skin. The best makeup tip is to drink water – not just while you put your makeup on, but generally. It plumps up your skin and makes it glow.Your foundation shade should always resemble your skin tone. Skin comes in different tones – this applies to all skin colours – so some people have warm tones, some have cool tones. One thing I often see is orange foundation with pink necks.People always ask me how to apply glitter and sparkles. You can stick crystals on your face with eyelash glue, the same for glitter. The trick is taking your time, using a fine angled brush and being quite precise. Then there’s how to take glitter off – because if you just wash your face, then you will end up with glitter everywhere for days. Instead, get some Sellotape and press it on to the glitter to remove. That will leave you properly glitter-free.If you are in a rush, then pick up your black eyeshadow and don’t put it down until you are done. You can use it for eyeliner, eyebrows, your eyeshadow crease – so just do them all at once, using one angled brush.I tend to do my brows using a gold liquid liner, which really adds a pop. I have even done it as a boy, when I have been going out to a club. It baffles me that people use tape or card to draw on their eyeliner wings – it’s not that hard to draw a straight line at a 45-degree angle! It looks manufactured and just makes me think that you failed art class.Drag makeup is designed to pop. The minute you walk in a room you’re going to catch everyone’s eye because your features are so exaggerated. I love the transformation that I create using makeup and I love knowing that people in the back row can see every detail.I call my face a Frankenstein face because there’s no one brand that I use on every single area. I use Kryolan and Mac foundation, all different kinds of eyeshadow, and liquid lipsticks from Anastasia. It’s a good idea to play and experiment.I use liquid lipsticks because they stay put. I’m not one of these dainty queens who has to have a straw – honey, I’m using my mouth. I’m eating, I’m drinking, I’m talking and I need lipsticks that stay where they are supposed to. You can also use liquid lipsticks for eye colour.Your eyebrows should be at least close relatives – if possible, twin sisters. When it comes to eye makeup, you don’t have to paint with all the colours of the rainbow. I’ve seen a lot of people who have obviously bought an eyeshadow palette that has five colours, and then put all five colours on their eyelids without blending them. The main technique is to go from light to dark, from the brow bone down to your eyelid. Then just blend everything.My go-to lipstick right now is anything nude – for me that means a muted, matt grey-toned pink colour. Currently I use Sugarpill Cosmetics Liquid Lip Colour in Trifle. It’s easy and it complements any makeup look. If you wear red and it bleeds out, you can look as if you’ve bitten into a red berry, but that doesn’t happen with nudes.I take as much time on my makeup as I do in creating a look or preparing for a performance and I think that is why drag queens tend to look so good. Beyond makeup techniques, it’s really down to time and preparation.RuPaul’s Drag Race UK starts on BBC Three on 3 October at 8pm and will be exclusively available on BBC iPlayer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc0ec2292e44ec39725505bf456f7cb5fc68c6f2/166_0_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=119fad9eff60d4c82b729e74186c88ce","title":"the cotton club encore review francis ford coppolas reworked masterpiece","story":"Released in 1984 to mixed reviews and box office failure, the musical drama has been expanded in a masterly new presentationFrancis Ford Coppola’s main revenue stream lately has been as a vintner. And as with a fine wine, his film The Cotton Club, first released in 1984 to a muted response, has blossomed with age.The Cotton Club Encore is an expanded rework of the original, from, in Coppola’s own words, a “less frightened, less easily bullied” director. Like the good bootlegger he is, he put half a million dollars of his own liquor money into this project. (A “presented by” credit also goes to the family of Las Vegas real estate mogul, Lorenzo Doumani.) Musical numbers which were excised from the previous release are restored. The studio also demanded that the storyline focused on the African American characters be reduced. This is given greater (though still not equal) footing now. At the time The Cotton Club was a box office dud and got one of its leads nominated for a Razzie. The Cotton Club Encore (plus 35 years of distance) is absolutely terrific.The Cotton Club was an institution of the Harlem Renaissance, where Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway (both given moments to shine in the film) revolutionized popular music. The performers were almost exclusively black and the clientele, at least at first, was only white. The first scene in the movie shows the great African American actor Woody Strode as the doorman turning away a potential patron for being too dark.The décor at the Cotton Club fetishized the black experience for its white audiences, with a Plantation-style set and exaggerated, sexualized murals. Yet on the stage one was given the privilege to witness black excellence. The secondary story in the movie is the arc of Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines), an enormously talented tap dancer. He catches his break at the club with an act featuring his brother (played by his actual brother, Maurice) and soon falls in love with Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), one of the light-skinned “Cotton Club Beauties”. In time, Lila Rose will struggle with whether to take advantage of her ability to pass as white and play the clubs outside of Harlem.Early on we see Sandman palling around with Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere), a cornet player and good-natured Harlem resident. As a proxy for modern white audiences to feel secure that, yes, there were “some good ones” back then, Dwyer has no interest in bigotry, even if the Irish, Jewish and (eventually) Italian gangsters who run the club and its environs are quick to toss epithets around.This isn’t to imply that Dwyer is a saint. He’ll call a Jewish mob enforcer (played by Julian Beck) “that Golem” and sighs that he doesn’t want to be treated like an “N-word”. But the nuance found between a character’s environment and his intentions is part of, in my opinion, what makes good storytelling.Dwyer’s woes begin when he saves a man’s life. Turns out it is legendary bootlegger Dutch Schultz (James Remar). Schultz takes a liking to him, and hires him to play music at one of his parties. (Of note: Richard Gere actually plays cornet and piano himself in this movie, and he’s good!) Things get complicated when Dwyer is pressed into service as Schultz’s bodyman. He’s forced to chaperone Schultz’s girl Vera (Diane Lane in some outstanding period costumes) and, wouldn’t you know it, the two fall in love. The two actors have remarkable chemistry and cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt does not skimp on making the pair look gorgeous.Gangland mechanics and turf wars occupy a lot of the run time, and even though I’ve seen approximately 450,000 mob movies I still don’t really know how a “numbers racket” works. It’s no matter. There is an avalanche of terrific supporting roles, like Tom Waits as the Cotton Club’s stage manager, Gwen Verdon as Dwyer’s ex-hoofer mother, Nicolas Cage as Dwyer’s hot-headed younger brother (based on an actual gangster named “Mad Dog” Coll), Joe Dallesandro as “Lucky” Luciano and Laurence Fishburne as a character based on “Bumpy” Johnson. There’s also Bob Hoskins (as Owney Madden, the club’s owner) and Fred Gwynne (mobster “Big Frenchy” Demange). They are brutal criminals and murderers, yet they have an almost R2-D2C-3P0 style look and relationship. When there isn’t blood spewing, there’s great warmth between them.Most importantly, though, The Cotton Club Encore is a jazz and tap dance exploitation film. The floorshow sequences aren’t quick clips, they are full performances. The Hines Brothers are the big winners, but there are a slew of dancers, singers and performers who deservedly get a moment in the spotlight. (A personal delight was seeing Jackée Harry doing some brassy comedy.)Though a theatrical run and Blu-ray release are planned, there’s no possible way Coppola is going to see a return on his investment here. This is a gift to cinephiles everywhere from deep in the cellar and we’re all lucky to get a sip."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff31959e291862c38093a995cb58b814b0024c3a/0_72_4141_2484/master/4141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=900fe0229251d492ad6d27d431f32a93","title":"arsenal standard liege europa league match report","story":"For Unai Emery this was an occasion to savour his work and question himself. The Arsenal manager quite rightly took delight in seeing his team maintain a perfect start to their Europa League campaign with a performance full of control and goals but it hardly did his reputation as a judge of talent much good that a player who struck twice and shone throughout as the spearhead of Arsenal’s attack is someone he does not feel has what it takes to be a central striker.That was Emery’s assessment of Gabriel Martinelli before this game, with the Spaniard insisting the 18-year‑old, who joined Arsenal from Brazilian side Ituano in the summer, is better deployed in wide areas. That appeared far from the case when Martinelli tore Standard Liège to bits in that very role.His goals, which arrived inside three first-half minutes, were expertly taken and he continued to show impressive movement, poise and purpose, as he did when also scoring twice against Nottingham Forest last month as the main man up front.Arsenal’s recent history is littered with South Americans who have faded fast but Martinelli looks a genuine prospect, and a goalscoring one at that.Somewhat remarkably, Emery insisted again that central striker is not Martinelli’s best position but, having deployed him there, he went on to praise the teenager’s contribution, which alongside two goals included the assist for Arsenal’s fourth goal, a lofted cross that was turned into an empty net by Dani Ceballos on 57 minutes. “His performance and attitude was amazing,” said Emery. He was not wrong.Martinelli was just one of many players in red and white who caught the eye. Emery made 10 changes to the team that drew 1-1 with Manchester United on Monday and such was the hosts’ collective swagger and authority that you could forgive the man in charge if he decided to go with the same lineup for Bournemouth’s visit here on Sunday.It is certainly possible that Héctor Bellerín, who captained Arsenal in his first start since January, will keep his place, as could Kieran Tierney, who was a dynamic presence at left-back in his second appearance for the club. Then there were the contributions of Reiss Nelson and Joe Willock, two more youngsters who yet again showed they have bright futures at the club.The same can not be said for Mesut Özil who, as was the case at Old Trafford, failed to make even Arsenal’s bench. That is an ongoing saga that mattered little as Arsenal’s alternatives made their presence felt on the European stage for a second successive game. Last month’s 3-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt was followed by this thumping win and with two games gone, Arsenal already look primed to qualify with ease from Group F.Arsenal were indeed quick, not only in the tempo of their play but also in how they built their lead. Three goals were scored inside the opening 22 minutes, with Martinelli getting his first on 13 minutes via a perfectly timed glancing header from Tierney’s near-post cross. The Brazilian’s second came from practically the same spot, this time via a composed right-foot finish, and entered him into Arsenal’s record books at 18 years and 107 days he is the youngest player to have scored two goals in a major European game for the club.Martinelli should have completed his hat-trick on 53 minutes but directed a low shot from in front of a practically open net wide of the far post.In the grand scheme of things it did not matter – by that stage the hosts were rampant having gone 3-0 ahead thanks to Willock’s cool finish. Then came Ceballos’s goal, his first for Arsenal since arriving from Real Madrid on loan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1fb0707bb3c8bfa14409e04c494bdf187961cfd/0_52_4241_2544/master/4241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43e1e9a6117be6b348e0cbb1b62f798c","title":"az alkmaar manchester united europa league match report","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær is still looking for his first away win as Manchester United’s permanent manager. Newcastle on Sunday would seem an inviting opportunity but Solskjær is going to have to alter his team and his tactics from this limp showing to have any hope of beating even such demoralised opponents as Steve Bruce’s side.This was just as presentable a chance to turn a corner, yet a United side sorely lacking in ambition and creativity were unable to take it, merely adapting to Alkmaar’s level and in the end being quite fortunate to escape with a draw.Solskjær’s worries were compounded by Jesse Lingard limping off late on with a hamstring injury to leave United to see out the match with 10 men.They were not exactly outplayed, in a borrowed stadium in front of a crowd slightly less than the stated capacity of 15,000, though the home side created the better chances and the captain for the day, David de Gea, was certainly the busier of the two goalkeepers towards the end of the match. Marco Bizot in the Alkmaar goal was a virtual spectator throughout. While United had a late penalty claim waved away when Marcus Rashford came on, more damning was their failure to register a single attempt on target.“It should have been a win, I’m fed up complaining about penalties we should have had,” Solskjær said, brazenly ignoring the fact that Alkmaar also had a couple of reasonable appeals turned down, in addition to managing the odd shot on target. “The linesman had a good view of the tackle on Marcus and he wasn’t interested. A better decision and we would all be sitting here smiling now, but it’s no good me going on about it. We just have to hope that one day the decisions will start going in our favour. We didn’t get to grips with the pitch until the second half, so I regard today as a good away point. If we win our home games and stay unbeaten away we should be all right in the group.”Solskjaer’s concerns before the game had focused on the artificial surface, though it was clear from an early stage that Alkmaar could pose problems with the ball in the air. Myron Boadu had the ball in the net after 11 minutes from Fredrik Midtsjø’s cross. He was correctly ruled offside, yet De Gea would not have been impressed by his defenders allowing a free header. De Gea was called upon to make the first save of the game shortly afterwards, reacting well to Oussama Idrissi’s well-struck shot, and from the resulting corner Dani de Wit put another free header over the bar.United had started well enough, with Daniel James not only playing but initially being deployed through the middle. After the first quarter passed without a visiting shot on target Solskjær had a rethink and put James out on the right, again not his best position, with Mason Greenwood taking up his expected central role. This almost brought immediate results, with Diogo Dalot sending James skipping down the right and Greenwood meeting his cross in the middle, only for the former Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar to block a goalbound effort.If that was encouraging it was also untypical of United’s first-half efforts. Alkmaar played the more effective counterattacking game, at least proving capable of moving the ball swiftly upfield and on several occasions entered the United area with purpose. United by comparison were ponderous and uninspired, retaining possession easily enough but failing to find any real penetration. At 34 Vlaar might have been viewed as a weak link in the Alkmaar defence, but the plodding, sideways game United played made it easy for the home side to stand their ground without being asked to run about too much.Making his first start for United, the left-back Brandon Williams was lucky to get away with handball in the area early in the second half. Giving away a penalty would have spoiled an otherwise confident display, though the ball struck his arm and referees are now being told to ignore considerations of intent. Rashford was sent on after an hour in an attempt to give United a little more bite up front. In the end it was another substitute, Lingard, who shot wide with a late chance to win the match, before limping off. Rashford’s main contribution, a free-kick blasted wastefully high over the bar, was more in keeping with United’s overall performance. While Solskjær will always have Paris, in his present situation he will not be allowed to live on the memory indefinitely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3587d885f03342d84d97a185bdd74d423a2a94/0_62_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afc717f3c452955c1381ea95edeb8569","title":"jordan nobbs england return familiar territory","story":"Arsenal midfielder who missed the World Cup through injury is back on international duty at the club where her career beganThe Arsenal midfielder Jordan Nobbs is buzzing to be back in England kit after a lengthy spell out of action with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. “It was weird because I forgot the excitement of what it’s like being called up again,” Nobbs says before training at St George’s Park this week. “I can’t believe it’s been so long but it was exciting.”The thrill of ending an 11-month absence from international duty is enhanced by Saturday’s friendly against Brazil taking place at Middlesbrough, where Nobbs’s England journey began when she was attached to the club. “I first got picked for England at 12 years old at Middlesbrough so it was kind of fate that it is my first camp back for England,” says Nobbs, who was born in Stockton-on-Tees. “Hopefully I can have a lot of family and friends there to see me back playing for England.”Having ruptured an ACL against Everton in November 2018, Nobbs had a tough choice: whether to attempt to recover for the World Cup. “It was a hard decision as obviously nobody wants to say they don’t want to go to a World Cup. But I’m 26 and I have heard some disaster stories as well as good stories so it was about weighing that up.” That she ruled herself out, putting her long-term health above the short-term gain, has meant that she has been in no hurry to rush things now she is fit.When Nobbs fell to the ground in agony playing for Arsenal against Everton last November, her screams echoed around Southport’s ground and the crowd held their breath. The possibility of England’s midfield engine being ruled out would, for some, rule England out of contention in France.“In a selfish way it was good for me. Some people thought it was crazy that I was going out to the World Cup when I wasn’t playing but my mindset was in a much better place it allowed me to focus on different job roles. It could have gone drastically wrong but I’m very grateful I played a part in that.”Having almost scored instantly on her return for Arsenal, a goal has taken six games to come, but it came in style – a tight, angled volley from a Vivianne Miedema cross. The problem was she took it with the wrong foot, her right foot, ending an amusing run of 15 Arsenal goals being scored with alternating feet. “None of the girls knew where that stat came from but I’m the dumb one of the team so when it was me it was like: ‘Typical Jordan.’ I got a bit of stick for that ...”The focus is on staying fit, for Arsenal, who are the closest they have been to a fully fit squad in a year, and for England, not least because she is eyeing an Olympic spot. “The last Olympics I was in the long list squad. It’s the biggest tournament you could be a part of. Being part of Team GB is my goal.”Avoiding injury is key, too, because of her impact in the dressing room. Montemurro recently spoke of her influence on morale. “No pressure,” she says with a grin. “I hope so. I think about Steven Gerrard: he was a player I looked up to a lot, his work rate and things like that. I hope that puts you already at a certain standard. I like to think the girls would listen but they’re in an incredible place anyway where we all respect each other and we all want to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a597d64b74f80bdee6d2c31993b677d8576f80d4/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b2ae74052c04d24c04ff43aff092835","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Brendan Rodgers returns to Anfield, Spurs offer opponents too much space and Bournemouth have Arsenal in their sightsBrendan Rodgers returns to Anfield on Saturday, sensing an opportunity to end his former club’s perfect Premier League start. Last season, a much less adventurous Leicester side got a point at Liverpool, triggering a costly spell of self-doubt for Jürgen Klopp’s title chasers. There has been virtually no sign of weakness from the Reds in the league this term, but Salzburg’s dramatic Champions League fightback may have shown Rodgers the way forward. Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold made surging infield runs against Salzburg, a tactic that helped Liverpool race into a three-goal lead as Robertson scored. As the game changed, the hosts were left exposed in wide areas as their opponents poured forward. Leicester will be a threat on the counter and have plenty of pace and craft on the flanks, not least through their own full-back pairing of Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira. Rodgers’ side are dangerous opponents, and Klopp will hope the reliable Joël Matip is available to slot back into central defence. NMManchester United travel to St James’ Park on Sunday, a year to the day since a 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford where Alexis Sánchez’s late winner saved José Mourinho from the sack. A year is a long time in football. While much has changed since, both teams are still dealing with the same fundamental issues. Manchester United cannot conjure any kind of consistency or fluidity, and Newcastle are short of goals and fearing relegation. Last year, Rafael Benítez’s safety-first approach got them out of trouble. Under Steve Bruce, they have lost their solidity at the back without getting any better going forward they are the league’s joint-lowest scorers. Since beating Chelsea 4-0 in their league opener, Manchester United have scored seven goals in nine games, with turgid draws against Arsenal and AZ Alkmaar this week. In short, don’t expect another five-goal thriller in this Super Sunday showpiece. NMWolves’ shaky start appears to be behind them now, with two victories and two clean sheets inside a week. Before the trip to Besiktas, captain Conor Coady had targeted defensive improvement and they delivered in Istanbul, with centre-back Willy Boly grabbing a last-gasp winner. Boly was a key figure in both fixtures against Manchester City last season, scoring a handball opener at Molineux and getting sent off early at the Etihad in a 3-0 defeat. That was Wolves’ only league red card last term this year, they have already doubled that tally, with Boly dismissed at Everton and Romain Saiss sent off at Crystal Palace. Defensive discipline is not all about keeping clean sheets, and while Wolves may travel in hope rather than expectation after such a long midweek trip, concentration will be key. In midweek, Dinamo Zagreb showed the benefits of taking on City with a clear defensive strategy two weeks ago, Watford showed the pitfalls of not doing so. NMIt remains early days but West Ham appear to have bridged a gap they been trying to bridge for a while. A spluttering of mid-table finishes failed to stimulate much excitement around a club that harbours explicit hopes of qualifying for Europe, but there are signs they could make a reasonable play for those places under Manuel Pellegrini. Sébastien Haller came at a cost, but the £45m striker looks more than just a 6ft 3in handful and, behind him, Pellegrini has a plethora of options to pick from, including the fit-again Manuel Lanzini. How they will fare without the injured Lukasz Fabianski remains to be seen, but with Everton and Wolves yet to convince, it would be wrong to overlook Pellegrini’s credentials to deliver a top-seven finish. The Chilean has form for parachuting unfancied teams into the upper echelons, having propelled Villarreal and Málaga into Europe, and early evidence suggests West Ham, who finished 10th last season, have the tools to go close. BFThese teams last met when the Canaries secured the victory that brought them last season’s Championship title. The extent of Aston Villa’s post-promotion recruitment drive is no secret but here is a telling illustration: of the 14 players who played either from the start or from the bench for Norwich that day all are still at the club, every one has played in the Premier League and most are doing so regularly, having between them played 5,378 league minutes. Of the 13 players who appeared for Aston Villa six have left the club, two remain but have not been used and just two have started a top-flight match since promotion. Between them those 13 players have played 828 minutes, of which Neil Taylor is single-handedly responsible for 568. Take away Taylor and the remaining 12 have, on average, played a mere 21 minutes and 40 seconds of league football for Villa this season, or a still unimpressive 43 minutes 20 seconds if you discount the departed players. Take away the one member of that Norwich side who has been most used this season, Ben Godfrey, and the remainder have averaged 360 minutes and 23 seconds. For all that the sides are currently separated by only one point, but this is a chance for one of them to prove that their methodology is superior.

Last season they earned notable victories over Chelsea and Tottenham on home soil but failed to take points off any of the top six away from Dean Court, mustering three goals along the way. They were thumped 5-1 by Unai Emery’s side in February and in their last eight meetings, the aggregate score reads 20-8 against Eddie Howe’s side. There is no doubt Bournemouth can hurt teams and Philip Billing has formed a promising midfield partnership with Jefferson Lerma, but a defence that is susceptible to leaking cheap goals – one without a clean sheet in the Premier League this campaign – will likely be tested again in north London. If Howe can find a defensive remedy, Arsenal could be in for another difficult afternoon. BFIt was made abundantly clear to Ralph Hasenhüttl that beating Portsmouth was non-negotiable, and that Southampton supporters would happily shrug off defeats in the league games that bookended that Carabao Cup tie at Fratton Park safe in the knowledge they had recorded victory over their despised rivals. But they can ill-afford league form to suffer too much. If they fall to defeat at home to an in-form Chelsea, they will have lost three Premier League games on the bounce. After the international break they travel to Wolves and host Leicester before November presents trips to Manchester City and Arsenal. Victory over Pompey was priceless but they need to pick up points and fast – particularly at home, where they are yet to taste victory this season – if they are to avoid getting dragged into another all-too familiar relegation scrap. BFEverton’s last visit to Burnley will provoke unusually conflicting memories for the home side. It was, on one level, a complete humiliation: they were a goal down inside two minutes, three behind by the time the opening period was halfway through, and went on to lose 5-1. After that game, however, Sean Dyche made a few changes – Dwight McNeil had started once all season but has only failed to start one league game since Joe Hart had played every league game but has not got off the bench since – Burnley won five and lost none of their next eight and proceeded to finish comfortably clear of relegation. “I thought we bottomed out that day,” Sean Dyche said as the season neared its conclusion. “It is a hard thing to put your finger on but it is a collective thing of, ‘That’s enough.’” Now they will want to show the extent of their improvement against the side that pushed them to the bottom. “It’s one we want to put right,” Ben Mee said. “We’ll definitely be up for it and it will be a good buzz if we get a good result.” SBOf Watford’s last 19 league games, amounting to exactly half of a top-flight season, they have won only four, and taken a total of 15 points. That is point accumulation at a rate that would guarantee relegation if continued over an entire campaign, and partly explains the haste with which they disposed of Javi Gracia last month, after he led his team to one point from four winnable matches. More worrying still, all but one of those four victories came against teams now playing in the Championship. Not since Andre Gray’s last-minute goal brought a 2-1 win over Leicester more than seven months ago have Watford beaten a current Premier League side. They took 16 of a possible 18 points against the teams that eventually went down last season, and this first meeting of the season with a recently-promoted side is a chance for them to see if they feel equally at home against sides that eventually came up. Watford’s defence is seen, not unreasonably, as the side’s great weakness but it is surely time for their attack to contribute a little more: they have taken 105 shots – more than every side except Manchester City (150), Chelsea (120) and Liverpool (105), but of those only 30 have been on target and just four have gone in.

Photographs and video by Achilleas ZavallisThe last day of 14-year-old Raja Hamid Yahya al-Oud’s life began like any other.She got up early along with the rest of the family because there was always a lot of work to do on the farm in the spring planting season. White drones had intermittently circled above their cornfields for the last few weeks, but there was no sign of them that morning.Raja and her mother, Amira, liked to take breaks under the acacia trees about 200 metres from the house. At 4pm, this was to become her final resting place.The plane was flying too high for them to hear it coming but Amira said the sound the CBU-52 BB cluster bomb made as it rained 220 deadly submunitions on their heads will stay with her forever. Some exploded on impact while others, still armed, fell into the fields.Screaming for her daughter, Amira saw Raja’s twisted body under a small tree. Her jaw and entire right side had been ripped apart and blood had already dyed the sand around her black. A neighbour, Hamoud Mohammed al-Ghar, dodged the remaining submunitions to pick Raja up and then ran with her to the nearest road to find a car to take her to hospital. “I knew the girl was already dead,” he said. “But I had to try.” The drones circled ahead the entire time.Raja died on 23 March 2018. But the story of the bomb that is believed to have killed her stretches back decades earlier. Using the serial number and other technical information on the CBU-52 BB’s outer shell, the  traced the munition from its manufacture in Milan, Tennessee, to Sahar farms, in north Yemen, where it ended a child’s life.Cluster munitions were invented by the Nazis and had become a standard weapon of war across the world by the 1970s, designed to kill as many people as possible.They usually consist of a hollow shell filled with hundreds of submunitions that disperse over an area as big as several football pitches as it falls through the air. They either explode on impact or are triggered when moved or stepped on, firing hundreds of fragments of metal that travel at the speed of bullets.The submunitions remain a threat for decades once deployed and those from older designs often resemble shiny silver orbs around the size of a tennis ball, making unexploded ordnance especially attractive to curious children. Hundreds of people worldwide die each year after coming into contact with unexploded cluster bombs, with about 300 casualties a year in Vietnam alone.In 2008 an international treaty called the convention on cluster munitions severely limiting the use, transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs was adopted by 30 countries. By 2018 it had been signed by 120 states. The US, which sells arms to Saudi-led forces fighting in Yemen, was not one of them.“Cluster munitions went through a proportionality test to measure military advantages gained versus civilian harm of their use,” said Rawan Shaif, the lead Yemen researcher at the open source investigative organisation Bellingcat, of the Geneva conventions relating to the protection of victims of armed conflict. “There’s no military advantage in using a cluster munition in a farm, unless your aim is to make that area uninhabitable for generations of civilians and military alike.”The cluster bomb that killed Raja was manufactured at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant in 1977. The large site, just north of Jackson in west Tennessee, encompasses 231 miles (372km) of roads and 88 miles (142km) of railways and is nicknamed Bullet Town by residents.Milan’s fortunes have risen and fallen with that of the plant: work there has ebbed and flowed with America’s wars. Most of its ordnance and mortar production lines have been moved to Iowa by American Ordnance, the private contractor operating the plant. In 2013 it employed just 113 people, down from a peak of 10,000 during the second world war. By 1977 thousands of cluster bombs like the one that killed Raja were rolling off the production line. The US no longer manufactures CBU-52s: it has long since upgraded to “smart” computer-guided cluster bombs with supposedly more accurate arming and targeting systems. One possible reason a 1977 bomb found its way to Sahar farms, in Yemen, in 2018 is because the US has such a large stockpile of the weapons.In the interim, a good way of reducing the stockpile of outdated weapons – and making some money – was to sell them. Data from 2017 showed the US still had some 2.2m cluster bombs in its arsenal.“Many nations, including the US, Germany, and Switzerland, have taken steps in recent years to bolster both their pre-export due diligence, and their post-delivery verification methods,” said Nic Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, a specialist technical intelligence consultancy. “Nonetheless, there are a lot of arms that have been exported prior to these changes that muddy the waters in terms of how researchers can track and trace items of interest.”The US has been selling weapons, planes, tanks and ordnance to Saudi Arabia for decades and permitting its arms manufacturers to export: it has licensed $138bn (£112bn) to the kingdom in the last 10 years alone, according to research by the US thinktank the Center for International Policy. Officials under Barack Obama worried that sales, after Riyadh launched its air campaign against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels in March 2015, could amount to complicity in war crimes under international laws that could name the US as a co-belligerent, but in 2016 went ahead with a $1.3bn sale anyway.Bomb sales continue: Donald Trump, who has made Saudi Arabia the cornerstone of his Middle East policy, overrode objections from Congress in March to complete the sale of more than $8bn worth of weapons to Riyadh, its coalition partner the United Arab Emirates coalition partner, and Jordan.The total extent of export licences to the kingdom is not known, and neither is it known when the bomb that killed Raja was sold. The SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, the world’s most extensive record, yielded no results: it contains just a fraction of true sales, as pre-digital record-keeping was poor and states cite national security concerns to avoid disclosing records.It is possible the CBU could have been sold by the US years ago to a third party state and then sold on again to Saudi Arabia: cluster bomb sales to Riyadh were officially stopped in 2016. The US Department of Defense and the state department did not respond to requests for information. Such inquiries are usually met with no comment.Washington says US supplies of “smart weapons” are helping the coalition reduce civilian casualties – but as Raja’s death shows, old US-made dumb bombs are still being used.What we do know is Sahar farms was bombed on 23 March last year after the area had been surveyed by drones for weeks. “We are just farmers,” Hamid Yahya al-Oud, Raja’s father, said over tea in his living room, surrounded by his six remaining children. “Look outside. There’s our well, there’s our goats. Why would there be Houthis here?”At the time of publication, the coalition had not responded to the ’s requests for comment.Sahar farms lies in the countryside of Saada in north Yemen, the Houthi heartland on Saudi Arabia’s border. The whole province is littered with bombed-out buildings, bridges, roads and unexploded ordnance. The green cigar-like shell of the CBU-52 BB cluster bomb is one of the most common of those dropped on the area, according to Abdullah Umayyad, the manager of the UN-funded Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (Yemac) field office in Saada.The coalition rarely acknowledges civilian casualties from airstrikes, making justice or even simple answers for affected families about why they were targeted almost impossible.“It took two days to clear out Sahar farms after that strike,” said Umayyad. “The work is very dangerous. Three men have been killed in clearance operations here in Saada. My old boss lost his hands, eyes and nose after trying to disarm a cluster bomb submunition last year.”Despite condemnation from human rights groups over airstrikes in Yemen, Yemac’s records suggest more cluster bombs are being dropped on Saada than ever: at least 147 cluster munitions were recovered in the province in the first six months of 2019, up on 122 in the same period of 2018.Its record-keeping, however, is spotty and inidual items are not catalogued. Questions of who, what and why when it comes to bombings fall outside its remit: the political fallout could impact the team’s ability to work across the war-torn country.US-made bombs rain down on north Yemen with almost total impunity.At Sahar farms, the drones have been back in the last two months. “They already killed my daughter,” said Hamid. “Now they’re back for more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea341a1b3da5e19b005347140554975a71a6f0d/0_0_5206_3470/master/5206.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d4771a6719bef8d23ceba453d93205b 480w","title":"kim gordon theres a wall of faceless men i have to climb over","story":"She’s the art-rock legend who made Sonic Youth punk – and now, at 66, she has made her first solo record. She drives our writer through LA to talk Donald Trump, existential angst and her anthem called Air BnBBefore she came to typify deadpan Downtown New York cool, Kim Gordon was a teenager in 1970s Los Angeles, smoking pot and listening to Joni Mitchell. It was the pot that landed her in “Disney jail”. Gordon and her friend were in a cave on pirate-themed Tom Sawyer’s Island, lighting up a joint, when the Disney cops swooped in.“They took us underground,” Gordon recalls – to a netherworld where she saw “Mickey Mouse with a walkie-talkie” and endured creepy comments from the officers: “Does your mother know you’re not wearing a bra?”Gordon was left in a juvenile holding cell overnight. She was taking a political science class at the time, and her mind whirled. “I was writing this paper in my head about Disneyland and how fascist it was,” Gordon tells me. “It confirmed my beliefs about American consumerism.” It’s a belief she still holds. “Consumerism is killing us,” she says today.Kim Gordon v Disney is an unusually revealing punk-rock folk tale: from the earliest days of Sonic Youth, the band she co-founded with her ex-husband Thurston Moore, Gordon’s music, art criticism and paintings have been a kind of post-Warhol skewering of American myths. That sceptical eye extends to her first solo album, No Home Record – a bold mix of industrial noise, art-punk poetics and wry wit, which I’m discussing with Gordon at her sunny home in the quiet hills of LA’s Los Feliz district.On display is a signed copy of Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s Zuma a poster for Jean-Luc Godard’s Made in USA and another of Darby Crash of the Germs, who are Gordon’s favourite LA punk band because of their tendency to “deconstruct” on stage unexpectedly. “That’s my kind of entertainment.” Books cover the coffee table: Claire Denis by Judith Mayne Black Is a Color by Elvan Zabunyan Fascination by Kevin Killian. “I used to feel this existential nausea here,” Gordon says of LA. “Now it’s a sigh of relief.”Before Sonic Youth, Gordon fronted a situationist-style project focused on domestic interiors called Design Office. Once, in 2013, I watched her and the German artist Jutta Koether do a “one-act play” in which they read a 1991 magazine Q\u0026ampA between Gordon and the late artist Mike Kelley. If a home can be conceptual art, or reciting an interview, an interview in her home could be doubly so.Gordon was always what made Sonic Youth punk: her bass and guitar the inspired reach of her speak-sung vocals, her declaration that “women make natural anarchists”, her decades-long suggestion that things you wouldn’t expect can be art. She approached the mainstream with the irreverence of the underground and, in her abstracted way, tackled grim social realities, writing songs about Karen Carpenter and body image, media misogyny and sexual harassment at Sonic Youth’s record label.Gordon has long regarded herself more as a visual artist than a musician. “Playing bass was never my desire,” she says. “It was a byproduct of wanting to make something exciting.” At first, Sonic Youth were influenced by the brash extremities of the no-wave scene: “It was like a gauntlet was thrown down,” Gordon says. “‘Here, you try to make something.’” But in the male-dominated New York noise milieu, it was Gordon who made it seem as if anyone could pick that gauntlet up – that to be an artist you just have to begin. Her career has been an inspired testament to her own 1983 maxim that at concerts “people pay to see others believe in themselves”.Gordon and Moore’s orce spelled the end of Sonic Youth. Her raw 2015 memoir, Girl in a Band, aired the details of his infidelity and their difficult orce. “When I first found out Thurston had a double life, seeing the texts, I was about to go to yoga,” she tells me. “I was just looking at the time when I picked up his phone.” Gordon still went to yoga.She has since joined 303 Gallery as an outlet for her visual art and formed the immersive improv duo BodyHead with Bill Nace. She is co-editing a book of writing about women in music and has been consulting for the television show Daisy Jones and the Six, based on the bestselling novel about a fictional 70s band a la Fleetwood Mac. “I think they want to make it darker,” she says, “or that useless word, ‘authentic’.”Gordon has lived in Los Feliz for three years, having moved from, Massachusetts, where she and Moore raised their daughter, Coco, now 25. (Gordon later gives me one of Coco’s poetry zines, which includes a beautiful piece dedicated to her mother: “There’s a Crack in the Carpet – There’s a Dream in My Chest.”) Warm though still a bit elusive, at 66, Gordon says she is still not totally comfortable giving interviews to promote her work and talking about herself: “After a while, you feel like an imposter.” One of her paintings comes to mind: the dripping words Secret Abuse, Gordon’s comment on artists’ relationship to the commercial world. It reminds me of artists’ relationships to themselves, too, and she agrees: “The process is torture.”For her solo album, Gordon worked with an outside producer for the first time. In Gordon fashion, there is no particular reason now for making a solo album beyond the persistence of her producer, Justin Raisen. It is the first time she has worked so collaboratively with one. Raisen is an eccentric, new-age-y Angeleno by way of Long Island who says he made a habit of regularly chanting Gordon’s name in the weeks before the universe conspired to bring them together: he DM’d her after his brother met her at a restaurant. Gordon felt that Raisen – who has worked with Sky Ferreira and Angel Olsen – understood her “trashy, dissonant” sensibility. “It was pretty casual,” she says. “Justin just said: ‘Bring over your fucked-up poetry and we’ll make some shit.’ He was calling me Kimye.”Named after a film by Chantal Akerman, No Home Record powerfully makes the case for Gordon as an art concept herself, one who combusts notions of what music can be in order to obliquely expose the status quo. Her music feels more aligned with her visual art practice than ever – the lyrics of the vertigo-inducing Murdered Out mention matte-black spray. In her art and her music, her language is striking. She has recently painted hashtags – #Resist, #PussyGrabsBack, #YouDontOwnMe – and on No Home Record there is an abrasive anthem called Air BnB.“It’s just subject matter,” she deflects, before adding: “What is the modern-day landscape? What is a portrait now? I’m fascinated by the pictures on Airbnb, these little utopias you can try on, to escape from one’s objects and life.” She mentions the influence of Courbet and Manet, art depicting life happening. “The most interesting art to me is always kind of a critique of the culture,” she says. “Technology gives us a false sense of confidence that everything is always evolving.”When composing the lyrics for No Home Record, Gordon’s friend, the poet Elaine Kahn, prompted her to write down words from her everyday life. She often snatched phrases while driving around LA, looking at the signs in shopping malls. The title of the thundering closing track Get Yr Life Back was a phrase from a plastic sidewalk sandwich board promoting Get Your Life Back Yoga. “Everything is branded now: Get Your Life Back, Be Here Now, these slogans,” she says. In the album’s skittering opener, Sketch Artist, the lyric “dreaming in a tent” refers to LA’s homeless population. I ask if she is collaging reality. “A little,” she says, “or curating.” She suggests we drive around.Gordon grew up on the other side of the city, 45 minutes away, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where her father was a sociology professor. Her parents grew up during the Great Depression Gordon says they never bought into consumer culture. She attended a laboratory school at UCLA that focused on learning-by-doing, which, Gordon says, “really affected the process of how I make things”.“When I learned how to draw, I couldn’t do it,” she recalls, “I would get stuck if I just thought of the pencil on the paper. So I thought of designing the page in lights and darks. You can get so paralysed in art making. I pretend I’m doing something else.”She drives us through MacArthur Park, past Otis College of Art and Design, where she studied in the mid-70s. Other landmarks along the way include a taco stand and her favourite carwash. “Does that say Barbie Spa?” she asks at one point.The songs on No Home Record are also about the consequences of convenience, the breakdown of communication in relationships and the breakdown of the world. The slinking Paprika Pony features a “modern-day Adam and Eve, but they are on their cellphones”. Hungry Baby is about sexual harassment – a subject Gordon broached in 1992 with Sonic Youth’s Swimsuit Issue (Youth Against Fascism, from the same year, also feels upsettingly relevant again). “It was the tip of the iceberg,” Gordon says. I ask if she ever had to fight for her ideas. “There’s some unseen wall of faceless men that I have to climb over,” she says, “as if on a mission.”When Gordon opens Get Yr Life Back with a statement about “the end of capitalism”, she means that the system does not work: “Trump is the ultimate capitalist, destroying everything,” she says. Her wrenching conclusion – “I feel bad for you  I feel bad for me” – is both personal and political. “People advocate forgiveness, which is a good thing, but the reality is different,” Gordon says. “You have to look out for yourself. Even the Dalai Lama says: you can be empathetic, but you don’t have to forgive someone.”In the car, I suggest that perhaps the spaciousness of the LA landscape relates to Gordon’s use of space and rhythm in her vocal phrasings The Sprawl, as Sonic Youth called it. She tells me that she recently listened to an audio version of Joan Didion’s 1970 novel Play It As It Lays while driving around – the tale of an anguishing woman traversing LA’s freeways alone. “Bleak on bleak,” Gordon laughs. “It really did capture that sense of driving around LA if you weren’t trying to get somewhere, but were doing a drift. And how isolating it can feel in the city.”That classic LA isolation is something she still experiences. “I definitely have moments where I feel, not lonely, but the fear of being alone for ever,” she says – articulating each word, slowly, with space. She’ll listen to music to cope – the Steve Gunn-Truscinski duo records, lately, and Kurt Vile – which “creates its own environment”, or she’ll do something physical, such as weightlifting.Gordon says that No Home Record’s Earthquake is, in part, about that audience-performer relationship, and I ask if she still feels the way she did, decades ago, when she wrote, “The most heightened state of being female is watching people watch you.”“If people are listening, you can feel this intense concentration, and it builds a level of trust,” she says. “I can be vulnerable in a way that I otherwise wouldn’t be able to be if I was just talking.After our MacArthur Park cruise, I wonder how it feels for her to be at another beginning. “There’s a sense that we work, and then we arrive somewhere, and that’s true – because if you work on something for most of your life, when you get into your 50s, you build momentum, and in a way it steamrolls,” Gordon says weeks later, by phone from the south of France, where she has an art show. “But maybe the Buddhism I read as a teenager rubbed off on me – I also like the idea of just always becoming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77a395c364b42bca5a2263f5c4cac14368e26a78/0_1191_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76d19fac1f6cd51f387492062f5be7a2","title":"pat thomas kwashibu area band obiaa review","story":"(Strut Records) The ‘golden voice of Africa’ reboots the Ghanaian form for a new, globalised fanbase Ghanaian highlife music has never been a single statement of artistic intent. Birthed from the indigenous rhythms of Akan music and incorporating western instrumentation such as electric guitars and horns before being played in the 1920s at exclusive gatherings of the upper colonial class – hence the music’s name – to now fusing American rap motifs in the sub-genre hiplife, Ghana’s most popular musical export is ever-changing. Yet, one of its greatest living exponents, vocalist Pat Thomas, has also been one of its most consistent representatives.Dubbed “the golden voice of Africa”, Thomas has been performing his honeyed tenor on highlife tracks for the past 50 years – a feat only rivalled by peer Ebo Taylor. Both men have recently had career-defining revivals, with Taylor releasing the excellent Appia Kwa Bridge in 2012 and Thomas making an album with the Kwashibu Area Band in 2015. Following a world tour for that record and the acquisition of a younger, globalised fanbase, Thomas’s second outing with his band is aptly called Obiaa! – everyone.There is a palpable feeling of joyous inclusivity on Obiaa!, one that is harnessed in that necessary exclamation point, as this is active, kinetic music. While Thomas’s lyrics aphoristically tackle the perils of “showing off on social media” on Onfa Nkosi Hwee and the merits of “being patient in life” on Ntobuase, he delivers each line with an unshakeable optimism, his “golden voice” still radiant and full of light.Bandleader Kwame Yeboah keeps the rhythm section glued to their clattering clave patterns, with Kweku Mensah and Kwesi Yeboah providing the sparkling guitar melodies so integral to the genre. The opening suite of Onfa Nkosi Hwee, Yamona and Bubu take on the dance band tradition of highlife, with the horn section providing effusive bursts of harmonic counterpoint, while downbeat numbers such as Obinim and Odo Ankasa allow Thomas’s voice full reign over their love-lorn balladry. Amid our penchant for curated archive compilations of far-flung genres, here is the living, breathing testament to a music that is very much still alive and being championed by those who have spent their lives perfecting its craft. Long may it continue in all its world-ning complexity.Guatemalan singer-songwriter Gaby Moreno releases a luscious, string-laden collection of songs, ¡Spangled!, celebrating the music of the Americas from Panamanian bolero to Brazilian bossa nova.

A general complaints procedure deals with more minor matters that are not investigated by the PSU.Areas of investigation by the PSU include allegations of crimes such as assault, sexual assault, racism, theft, fraud, harassment or “any behaviour likely to bring the Home Office into disrepute”. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the disclosures showed the Home Office’s immigration and nationality department was “not fit for purpose” and called for an immediate review.The PSU has the power to request witness statements, CCTV footage, notebook entries, texts and voicemails on Home Office-issued mobile phones. Matters investigated may be referred to the police or other agencies where appropriate.Home Office guidance states that the issues considered by the PSU have “potential for serious reputational damage to the Home Office as well as potential legal action taken against us. An assessment of each case will be conducted by the PSU to assess for the potential risk and if there is a risk of adverse publicity.”In an answer to a parliamentary question last year, the then immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, revealed there had been 25 allegations of sexual assault made by detainees against staff in immigration removal centres between 2014-15 and 2017-18.

The Windrush scandal has taught them nothing as they continue to rack up internal investigations with no real consequence and no substantial change. This culture is destroying lives and families every day and cannot be allowed to continue. The immigration and nationality department of the Home Office is clearly not fit for purpose, and the government must call an immediate review into its continued failings.”Toufique Hossain, a director of public law at Duncan Lewis, which has obtained disclosure of some of these internal PSU reports as part of legal challenges against the Home Office in immigration matters, said: “Grave concerns are raised as to Home Office failings on a daily basis. A government body essentially investigating itself, put simply, will never hold itself accountable.“The burden is very much placed on the inidual under the Home Office’s control, more often than not with the assistance of publicly funded lawyers and NGOs, to ensure that the Home Office is held to account. Only through these mechanisms can vulnerable iniduals access courts in order to vindicate their rights.”“Borders, immigration and citizenship system teams have the greatest interaction with members of the public so it is to be expected that there are higher numbers of complaints than for other non-public facing Home Office teams.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

Children are considered “super-spreaders”, liable to infect others in their family and a danger to the elderly. All children aged two to 11 will be offered the nasal spray vaccine in the coming weeks. Public Health England, NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care said last year’s flu season was not the most severe, but it still had an impact on hospital and intensive care unit admissions and there were nearly 1,700 deaths.“The NHS is setting in place a buddy system so the good trusts can teach and partner with ones that don’t have good figures to bring them up as fast as possible,” said Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England.He said there was an element of professional responsibility about the decision for healthcare staff to be vaccinated. “We do know that flu infections can also be asymptomatic and staff can spread flu without realising it. A patient doesn’t want to think seven out of 10 healthcare workers you will meet will be vaccinated. You want nine out of 10 to be vaccinated,” he said.Unison, representing healthcare workers, said staff responded best to encouragement. “No NHS worker would ever willingly put patients or colleagues at risk. But the highest vaccination rates are in trusts that encourage staff to get the jab, not those where employees are coerced,” said the union’s head of health, Sara Gorton.“Pressuring staff to have the injection, when some may be reluctant for genuine reasons, is counterproductive. The NHS couldn’t get by without the goodwill of its staff and trusts shouldn’t jeopardise that.”Van-Tam said there would be no shortage of vaccines, even if the UK crashes out of Europe without a deal. “There is no possibility that we won’t have enough vaccines,” he said. “This has been very carefully thought through.”Most of the vaccines needed will arrive in the UK before 31 October, he said. The only exception would be supplies for those under 65 at risk because of chronic conditions. The vaccine manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur would deliver two-thirds of what is needed before the Brexit date, but the final third in November.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has ordered an additional 400,000 doses of the quadrivalent vaccine (against four strains of flu) for this group, which would arrive before the end of the month. “We do recognise that it is an extraordinary year,” said Van-Tam."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edc4bdd6de9513d6a3606a0f75609e2dacc728c1/0_220_3292_1975/master/3292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e654c38db7d22476c3ca09a1e296fbf","title":"rent caps needed in manchester to curb housing costs report","story":"Study calls for new council powers and help for workers in gig economy struggling to find homesManchester’s leaders should be given powers to cap private rents in expensive areas after house prices quadrupled in 20 years, with people in the “highly volatile” gig economy particularly struggling to find a home, a report has warned.The report calls for a new devolution deal for Greater Manchester, with measures including “rent pressure zones” – a form of rent capping – to tackle the housing problem, especially in Manchester city centre, where average rents now top £1,000 a month amid a homelessness crisis.Already operational in Scotland, zoning enables the local authority to cap private rents in high-demand areas to ensure that certain neighbourhoods do not become enclaves for the rich.The RSA also says there needs to be help for workers in the gig economy, such as Deliveroo riders and Uber drivers, who struggle to obtain mortgages or even pass rental checks.In Greater Manchester, flexible contracts are on the rise, with half of jobs created in the region over the past five years being temporary or self-employment, the report says. Manchester is a “hotspot” for this “highly volatile” work, it adds.But it is not just takeaway delivery people who are in insecure work: fixed-term contracts are common practice in universities, of which Manchester has many, the author notes.In Manchester, average house prices are 6.6 times average incomes, higher than in the wider north-west. This is less than the English average of eight times, which is skewed by London, where, at the most extreme, house prices are more than 20 times average incomes.The situation in Manchester is compounded by a larger private rented sector than the national average and a waiting list of 13,000 for social housing. In Greater Manchester alone, 92,000 social homes have been lost through right to buy since 1980, according to the combined authority.An average house in Manchester now costs £175,000 compared with £36,500 in 1995, meaning costs have more than quadrupled in 24 years.The report also encourages Greater Manchester to implement minimum standards for access to private or neighbourhood outside space such as gardens, balconies and roof gardens. The Greater London Authority has already adopted a minimum standard of 5 sq metres of private space for each one- to two-person household, which increases with the number of people in residence.Hannah Webster, report author and senior researcher at the RSA, said: “Young people are being failed by our current housing system – and this is particularly true in Manchester.”She added: “A new Greater Manchester housing devolution deal should give mayors and councils Scottish-style powers to cap runaway rents in areas like central Manchester. These ‘rent pressure zones’ would help those facing steep rents in certain neighbourhoods, without taking the step of introducing rent controls across the board.”Suzanne Richards, Manchester city council’s executive member for housing and regeneration, said: “Our challenge is to improve standards and increase supply at the affordable end of the market to ensure all our residents have a safe and decent home to live in.“To meet this challenge, we are working closely with the city’s registered providers and housing associations to unlock as much investment as possible from government. We are also prioritising our own land and resources for investment in affordable and social housing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06b7b8ee8a729b55bf6d33b4c8daf112054af88e/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7462274ed0b965421d51c5e2a6dd048","title":"dina asher smith ice cream gold medal world championships","story":"Moments after shrugging off all that suffocating pressure by obliterating her rivals to win her first 200m world championships gold medal on Wednesday, an exhausted Dina Asher-Smith took a deep breath and her mind wandered back to where everything began. “It was something I dreamed about as a pipe dream when I was younger, when I started running, when I was eight years old,” she said.All those years ago, the 23‑year‑old never imagined her dreams would come true in Doha. Even her arrival into the world of athletics seems a fluke – only a bribe in the form of an ice-cream convinced the Perry Hall Primary School pupil to attend a running club where they ran cross country, a discipline she detested. It was her future coach John Blackie who saw her and put her on the right path, recruiting her to the Bees Academy in Bromley at the age of eight.By the time Asher-Smith left primary school and arrived at Newstead Wood School in Orpington, she was beginning to break records. However, for Vikki Eason, her PE teacher and athletics coach, it was Asher-Smith’s overall athleticism that was striking.“She was always a really able sportswoman in many different sports, not just athletics good at school games, she swam … I taught her as a PE teacher but also as athletics coach and she still used to come and compete for the athletics team.”The records continued. At 13, Asher-Smith recorded the 300m age‑best in a time of 39.16sec. Even as her athletics career took off and she began her long journey of juggling sport and academics, she continued to be an integral part of her school.For all her lofty dreams, Asher‑Smith kept them to herself. Eason did not know that her pupil harboured Olympic goals until she watched Asher-Smith appear at the 2012 Olympic games as a kit carrier.Asher-Smith returned to school emboldened and inspired, finally ready to embrace her potential.“That’s when she told me that she wanted to be an Olympian,” says Eason. “She was so keen and so enthusiastic to be so close to the athletics stars. She was keen to take part in all aspects of athletics she wasn’t just one of the ones to perform and not do anything else.”“Bubbly” is the word constantly used to describe Asher-Smith, and that is also how Eason remembered her. But that does not quite explain how Asher-Smith has been so ruthless in the face of pressure in a sport that relies so heavily on mental fortitude. Early last year, Asher‑Smith gave a Tedx talk where she spoke only of her career, her mindset and goals. Her opening line revealed plenty:“I’m Dina Asher-Smith and I am motivated by a fear of failure,” she said. “OK, ‘motivated’ isn’t a strong enough word to express how I feel. It’s more like an allergy to me – an itching, nagging feeling deep inside of me that gives me the inability to be complacent about anything.”Most sporting champions are forged in the smothering heat of adversity and no season prepared Asher-Smith for this week more than the nightmare of 2017, when she fractured her foot in training five months before the 2017 world championships in London.Ever since her Olympic experience, Asher-Smith had dreamed of London, so when doctors told her it was over, she refused to hear it. She worked tirelessly on her comeback and won a 4x100m relay silver after a fourth-place finish in the 200m. As well‑meaning people congratulated her simply on returning to the track, she realised that her attitude could not have erged more.“The focus from then on was not just being healthy, not just running painlessly but it was being world class,” she said. “It was being as close to my best as possible. So many people have told me: ‘Oh my god, it’s so good that you’re running. You’ve been so positive. It’s great.’ But I wasn’t in the business of just being positive. I don’t just go into the championships being positive. If I’m there, I want to be the best I can be and London was no different.”In 2013, as a 17-year-old, she received a surprise call from British Athletics to run in the 4x100m team. She was shocked at that and even more so when the British quartet secured a bronze medal. Those days are no more. Now, she calls herself a “championship performer”, and after she won the 100m and 200m double at the European Championships last year, she returned home to pandemonium. She is learning how to be famous.“Lots of people have been referring to me as a role model, which I still find very odd,” she said. “But at the same time I am rolling with it, because I do have a social responsibility to make sure young people have a positive person to look up to.”With a world title forever wed to her name and the Olympics on the horizon, there will only be more attention, more fame and more people looking up to her success as an example to emulate. But for all the fans she gains, it is telling that those who knew her first still back her all the way.“It’s absolutely amazing,” Eason said. “It’s just a real privilege to have taught her at school. For her to have worked with me and to now see her come through in the way she has? She’s just worked so hard and she’s so enthusiastic. It’s really lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2648efd48fbdc131e44bcdba4b76ab47a70c38f5/0_95_5115_3070/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cade7d4c52615a9466fc9d69dfd460bb","title":"england rugby world cup argentina jones","story":"Eddie Jones is eager for his team to stick to their plan and arrive at the knockout stages with gathering momentumCompared to their last three Rugby World Cup campaigns things are going almost unnervingly smoothly for England at present. They have no major injury concerns, the squad are relishing each other’s company in Japan and their lineup to face Argentina has an increasingly settled, confident look to it.Big tournament life is not supposed to be so serene, as England know from weary experience. By this point in 2007 they had been beaten 36-0 by South Africa in 2011 the wheels were already beginning to wobble in New Zealand. Four years ago they were in the process of losing to Wales and Australia on consecutive Saturdays, a grim old period for all concerned.Contrast that with the strong poker hand at Eddie Jones’s disposal this time around. When his side thrashed Ireland at Twickenham in their penultimate warm-up Test in August, it did not take a genius to foresee the management wanting to name the nucleus of that XV for the Pumas fixture. Fourteen of the 15 starters from that Irish fixture are back again, the only exception being the fit-again Anthony Watson on the wing for Joe Cokanasiga.With Mako Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, furthermore, all back on the bench, England’s small army of physios, conditioners and medics also deserve a pat on the back. Fate could yet intervene, clearly, but Jones could not have asked for much more before a fixture that has been circled in his diary for over two years. Beat the Pumas and, to some degree, England can relax, safe in the knowledge their knockout qualification is assured for the first time in eight years. There will inevitably be some idle teahouse chatter about whether they would be better finishing second in Pool C and potentially avoiding Australia and New Zealand in the quarters and semis but, equally, arriving in the last eight with gathering momentum and an unbeaten pool record would hardly be the worst outcome.While Jones is making dutiful noises about fully respecting Argentina, he also knows this would be a good moment to make a real statement against opponents who have not looked as threatening as usual at this World Cup. It would also nip in the bud the “boring” England narrative with which Jones is entirely familiar, having previously seen another former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer employ it successfully prior to the 1991 World Cup final.England’s pack were more than a match for anyone but that day, instead, the team chose to adopt a more open style which ultimately backfired. “It is the old two-card trick,” Jones said, grinning. “Bob Dwyer threw that one out there in 1991 and there was a response. Maybe if England hadn’t played like that they would have two World Cups on their sleeves.”There is more than one way, in other words, to skin a Puma and Jones has long been working on ways to maximise this current England side’s strengths. Above all else he wants his players to be crystal clear about the gameplan, dynamic with and without the ball, supremely fit and flexible enough to keep up with international rugby’s latest trends. In this tournament, given the frequently slippery ball and the reluctance of referees to ping every single ruck offence, it pays to have a range of different kicking options and, in particular, a mobile threat at the breakdown.Hence the return to the George Ford-Owen Farrell axis at 10 and 12, with Elliot Daly’s left boot in reserve and both Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in the starting back row. “I feel the game has moved into another cycle of contestability,” Jones said. “The referees want low penalty counts and when you have low penalty counts, that means you have a highly contested breakdown and more kicking. We just thought: how can we be best equipped in that area? Argentina have gone for big, tall, carrying back-rowers. We have got one big carrying No 8 between two industrious players at six and seven. Is that the right way? We think it is.”•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterPablo Matera and Marcos Kremer will be keen to challenge Jones’s hunch but, with temperatures of 30C forecast for matchday, conditions might not necessarily suit the heavier members of the Pumas pack. England will aim to back their fitness – save for Mako Vunipola and Nowell who Jones concedes are still working their way back to a full gallop – and to stick to their pre-arranged script. “I think we know what we are good at,” said Jones. “Like any good batsman you can get seduced by a loose ball outside the off stump every now and then. We are as guilty as anyone but, by and large, I think we are pretty disciplined.”Omitting Mark Wilson for the all-action Lewis Ludlam, however, was a tough call and Jones still rates such conversations as the hardest part of his job. After 25 years, I still find that difficult. We’ve got some disappointed ones.”He has also been saddened by news of the passing of his good friend Jeff Sayle, a popular stalwart of the Randwick club in Sydney. “He was just a great fella and is a real loss to the game. We’ve got to make sure we keep those characters in rugby.” A rip-roaring win for the Poms this weekend, perversely, would be a timely tribute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db71f88beddc559fce310b4855cb354bdaa23bb/0_197_3774_2264/master/3774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2616e70b66ca846dca1d2914059748c6","title":"ioc investigation alberto salazar athletes","story":"Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee president, says he has contacted the World Anti-Doping Agency asking it to investigate all athletes who trained with the banned coach Alberto Salazar.Salazar, who coached Britain’s Mo Farah for six years, was this week found guilty of “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” while at the Nike Oregon Project.Speaking on Thursday at a news conference, Bach said the case was “very worrying and raises serious concerns”, and that he would be asking Wada to take a closer look.Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federation, warned that any athlete who tries to stay secretly with Salazar would face a two-year ban themselves.On what he will be asking Wada, Bach said: “To see how many athletes have been investigated. Have all the athletes been investigated who have been training in this centre? Does the report address the whole period of the existence of this project or only part of it? Could any Olympic results directly or indirectly be affected?“We learned from the report that the athletes would not have known what happened to them – this is an important factor when looking at sanctions but disqualification is mandatory whether the athlete knows or not.”In a statement, Wada said it could not comment publicly until it had reviewed the case in full. Salazar has said he will appeal against the judgment. This week Farah, who has never failed a drugs test, said he had “no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line”.Meanwhile Coe has vowed to clamp down on athletes using prescription medicines for performance enhancement in the wake of Usada’s investigation into Salazar – including the use of asthma and thyroid medication. The use of such medication is not illegal under the World Anti-Doping Code, but many in the sport believe using drugs such as thyroxin is unethical because it could damage an athlete’s health.On Wednesday one leading coach asked UK Athletics to set up an inquiry into whether Salazar’s methods were ever used by British coaches and athletes. Coe admitted the issue was also a concern for him.“We are looking into this,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure that medical conditions are genuine – and that prescription-only drugs are not aiding human performance. However when it comes to therapeutic use exemptions, they have already been tightened up dramatically since when I first came on to the IAAF’s council. I think we were in the thousands for TUEs. Now it is literally a handful in real terms. So we’re much tougher about that sort of stuff.”Coe was also asked about comments made by the US 1500m legend Jenny Simpson, who said on Wednesday that a “black cloud” had hung over Salazar’s training group.“Jenny’s a very thoughtful athlete,” said Coe. The only point I would make is that if athletes feel that they’ve got something to tell us, they really must. Because they are the prime source of intelligence.”Coe also denied taking a swipe at the BBC and its presenter Gabby Logan, who was seen laughing when the pundit Michael Johnson told her off camera that the IAAF president was “full of shit”.“The BBC is a great broadcaster,” Coe said. “It’s got a fabulous history with our sport. I just made an observation about the comparison between what is easily concluded in a studio over a few days, and the bigger picture that I have to be thinking about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/322412589580b8b0407ec1e3a46fcf19013d1688/0_234_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95340e3229c4a2227ae01233241ae14a","title":"enable drawn in stall nine of small field as she chases history in the arc","story":"Sunday will be the smallest Arc field since 2007 with 12 runners as Frankie Dettori’s mount seeks a third win at LongchampEnable remains odds-on at 4-5 for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on Sunday after being drawn in stall nine for Europe’s showpiece event. Charlie Appleby’s Ghaiyyath, however, has drifted in the betting after being handed the widest draw in stall 12, a difficult starting position for a horse that seems best when he can get to the lead.Last year’s Arc showed the potential importance of the draw at Longchamp, as Sea Of Class, from stall 15, narrowly failed to overhaul Enable, from five, after being forced to drop in at the rear of the field. The smallest Arc field since 2007 should mean it is less significant on Sunday, giving Enable every chance to make history as the first horse to win the race three times.Three of the four horses at the head of the ante-post betting were drawn towards the outside, with Japan and Ryan Moore immediately to Enable’s left in 10. Sottsass, the French Derby winner, is the only leading contender with a low stall, against the rail in one.Magical, a stable companion of Japan at the Aidan O’Brien yard, is alongside him in stall eight, while Waldgeist, who will be André Fabre’s only runner as the trainer seeks a record eighth Arc victory, is drawn in three.Ghaiyyath, who took the Group One Grosser Preis von Baden by 14 lengths last time out, eased from 10-1 to 12-1 with several layers after the draw on Thursday, having made most or all of the running to win both in Germany and in the Prix d’Harcourt at Longchamp in April.His only defeat this year came in the Prix Ganay, again at Longchamp, when he was unable to dominate and while William Buick, his big-race jockey, has suggested this week that his mount is “not one-dimensional”, a soft lead on Sunday now looks highly unlikely.The going at Longchamp was described as soft on Thursday morning, with no more than 2mm of rain forecast for the track on Friday and Saturday. Earlier fears of more significant rain ahead of Sunday’s big race have also receded, with no more than 4mm expected at the track on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab4da113f8921a77abef88c1f4b09b6eb5454f1/0_1347_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e3c7416d999a6cf9aae874dc519cb19","title":"while you are here 8000 year history dance theatre","story":"From ancient mysteries to moments of joy, one place tells many stories over time. The creators of While You Are Here reveal how they made physical drama by staying putIt seems like a ridiculously ambitious idea. A dance-theatre hybrid based not on a set of characters nor a plot, but a place. Where the star of the show is a few square metres of land somewhere in the east of England, and the action s 8,000 years.The ambition belongs to choreographer Jonathan Goddard and director Lily McLeish. The pair had worked together a few times and found themselves musing on an idea: could you create a narrative that was vertical rather than horizontal, tracking the inhabitants of a single space over time, from ancient past to distant future?To realise their idea, Goddard, an award-winning dancer and movement director (he recently performed with Natalia Osipova in The Mother), brought in playwright Eve Leigh, author of often experimental plays including The Trick (although briefly better known earlier this year for being one of the neighbours who heard Boris Johnson arguing with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds in Camberwell). Leigh was asked to write a “play for dance” that would serve as the score. While there are plenty of choreographers who use text in their work, as well as theatre with a strong physical element, a script written specifically for dance is a much rarer thing.One of the themes of the play is people trying to solve the mysteries of the past – while she was writing, Leigh had a note above her desk: “Any banality can become a mystery given enough time” – and the script is suitably sphinx-like. Some scenes have straightforward dialogue, some no speech at all, leaping from a pub argument in the 1990s to a woman giving birth in the 18th century to a flooded field 20 years in the future. There’s plenty of room for interpretation. A sample scene: “1552. The fen is frozen. Time for an ice-skating competition!”It’s exactly the kind of playful provocation that Goddard and McLeish wanted as a vehicle for the four performers – Clemmie Sveaas, Chris Akrill, Jonathan Savage and Hannah Kidd – all impressive dancers who have moved into acting, and limberly straddle those two worlds. Coming at a script with a dancer’s mindset means delving much deeper into simple stage directions. One note in the play reads: “There is so much joy.” Rather than have everyone skip around smiling, Goddard and the dancers turn words into movement that works on a visceral level instead of a representative one getting the audience to feel joy, rather than see it.For director McLeish (a frequent collaborator with Katie Mitchell), dance is a medium that plays with the tension between naturalism and abstraction, and it’s also a way to fast-forward the long process of sitting round a table doing endless text analysis and backstories. “It was really refreshing to be able to work almost immediately on creating movement,” says McLeish. “With dancers, the movement coexists with the text. I love the fact that any small improvisation task becomes this amazingly beautiful movement piece.”When Goddard first started working as a movement director (at the National Theatre and the RSC among others) the ways of the theatre took a bit of getting used to. “There’s so much talking going on!” he laughs. “When I first started working with actors I used to get headaches by the end of the day.” But there’s a lot he’s learned that he wants to bring into dance. Such as the way directors are so focused on the audience’s experience. Or to put it bluntly, wanting people to understand what’s going on. “This is a generalisation,” he says, “but I think choreographers see themselves as artists. The way an artist puts a painting on a wall and says you get it, or you don’t. Whereas a director sees themselves as a communicator, I think.”There’ll still be plenty of ambiguity to chew on in While You Are Here, inevitable considering the scale of the topic. What is the ultimate effect of compressing eight millennia into less than 80 minutes?“I feel like one of the huge challenges that we’re facing as a culture is this idea of imagining geological time,” says Leigh. “That feels really important in terms of dealing with the climate crisis. This is by no means about the crisis,” she adds, “but it’s about the fact that there was an Earth before humans and humans can disappear.” Seeing humanity unfold over the centuries certainly gives some perspective. “The huge traumas of our lives, they’re the same dramas that people have been facing for hundreds of years, and will be facing, to the extent we have a future,” says Leigh.“I think it shows human resilience,” says Goddard. “And the pure emotions – joy, pain – that we conduct though our bodies.”“For me, the effect is that I feel like I am a tiny part of a much much bigger puzzle and that feels strangely comforting,” says McLeish. “I also find it satisfying to watch the space’s story move at a much slower pace than humans. It reminds me that we are only brief visitors in a much longer story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d93801f8a5bbfb10973c92deebf668a9e6f20444/0_198_2969_1781/master/2969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c74e3c27c92f5457ff2094a697beedf","title":"catherine the great review helen mirren labour of love needs magic touch","story":"The perfect actor gives a magnificent performance ... and yet the show around her falls flatThe great handicap of HBO’s new four-part costume drama Catherine the Great (Sky Atlantic) is that she’s not Henry VIII. Little common knowledge can be assumed and an awful lot of time and effort has to be spent explaining quite where we are and who has done what to whom to get us there. An opening caption sets the scene, which you can choose to read in your A-Team or Star Wars voice: “Catherine’s turbulent reign began in 1762 with a military coup. She seized power from her husband Emperor Peter III who died soon after – in mysterious circumstances. Surrounded by enemies and fighting off rival challenges to her throne, Catherine’s rule is far from secure.” If you have a problem, if no one else can help you, maybe you can hire … Count Orlov and Grigor Potemkin. No, wait, I’m getting ahead of myself.Catherine the Great is played, magnificently, by Helen Mirren. If she were not, questions would surely be asked in the House. Her formidable talent and long career has made her into acting royalty herself and in recent years she has become a specialist in monarchs proper, leaning into her innate regality to produce award-winning turns as Elizabeths I and II. Even more pertinently for her latest venture, she was also born Helen Mironoff, daughter of Vasily Petrovich and granddaughter of Pyotr Vasilievich Mironov, a colonel in the Imperial Russian army. It feels as much a labour of love as the glad seizing of a part that would be catnip to any actor.So this series has the perfect actor and comes, in many ways, at the perfect time – ripe for the story of a woman resented on all sides for refusing to shape herself or her desires to the traditional feminine mould and becoming instead the embodiment of the writer Florence King’s note: “When a woman steps out of her place, she always steps up.” Not all of them arrange a coup d’etat removing their husbands from power and having them assassinated (she maintained plausible deniability over the latter), of course.Her now-lover Orlov and his brother are angling for a slice of power. The army reckons it put the Empress on the throne and can knock her off it any time. There are those who consider her regent only until her son Paul reaches his majority and can take over. There are others who have met Paul and would rather a large fur hat governed Russia than that 18-year-old milksop. And then there’s Prisoner Number One, poor Ivan IV, a claimant to the throne confined in Shlisselburg prison for all of his 24 years and sent mad in the process, but who still acts as a rallying point for Catherine’s opponents.Before long we are all in a welter of intrigue, treachery and general skulduggery – and once Potemkin heaves into view, you can add sexual rivalry too. It really is, one hopes, so unlike the home life of our own dear queen.In the opening episode, the liberal-minded empress must lose some of her ideals and find her cojones instead. Ivanites move against the empress, so her orders to have him killed are carried out. The army’s Lieutenant Merovitch tries to stir up trouble and finds himself decapitated, despite her insinuation of a pardon on the scaffold. Only Potemkin offers her a safe space, and he is soon defenestrated by the Orlovs for his pains. He survives, though only to have to attend a fancy dress palace ball (which hardly seems fair on the man).The parts are all good – the scenery, the performances, the script – but they add up to slightly less than their sum. Perhaps it is the extra exposition that makes it feel too ponderous and prevents it from taking flight. Or perhaps it is the fact that when it comes to creating anything, you can do all you can to maximise your chances of success but the final ingredient is always elusive. Call it magic, call it luck, but you need it to alchemise your efforts. If it’s not there what you have is a sturdy workhorse, full of fine actors, good moments and impeccable intentions, but not the elegant thoroughbred or racing steed of your dreams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cc5ec3fa371e74649042e71629b8fe83e0af58c/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c2e43a0f02ab21dada060c9f1f1428f","title":"raising dion review black superhero boy netflix michael b jordan","story":"A boy with amazing powers, brilliant special effects and a sprinkling of Michael B Jordan make Netflix’s new superhero show perfect fodder for families ... and the child inside us all Raising Dion began as a short film born of comic writer Dennis Liu’s desire for a more representative array of superheroes than has been gifted us by America’s homogenous “golden age”. It went viral and now the story of a black, widowed mother bringing up a seven-year-old boy with increasingly astonishing powers has been transmuted into a nine-part series on Netflix.It has the charm and heart of Smallville, which filled the family-friendly (if not erse, save young Superman’s friend Pete, played by Sam Jones III) slot for the last generation that Raising Dion is designed for. Newcomer Ja’Siah Young is another of those amazing child actors the US seems to produce so effortlessly. And, as recently bereaved and unemployed mother Nicole, Alisha Wainwright manages to cover bewilderment, grief and fear for her suddenly extraordinary, and therefore extraordinarily vulnerable, child in a way that will make parents ache for her without alienating the youngsters who surely form the show’s main audience.The latter – and the child inside each of us – can thrill at the many and pleasing special effects: floating milk and cereal, Lego whirlwinds, fish rising in bubbles of water out of a lake as Dion explores his telekinetic abilities, last-second zooms out of the way of trucks as teleportation kicks in under stress. And they are only made more wondrous by the realism of the rest. When Nicole loses her job, she loses her medical insurance, and their first trip to the pharmacy to refill Dion’s asthma inhaler is a horror. Smallville never made such points, but the times they are a-changing.For them, too, are the stories of building friendships and coping with the minor treacheries and betrayals school life brings. The relationship that gradually builds – at her formidable insistence – between Dion and wheelchair-user Esperanza (Sammy Haney, another revelatory child actor, who has brittle bone disease) is particularly touching. In one episode, a storyline revolves around him learning why he should not use his powers to levitate her against her will. You can imagine it starting many an interesting and potentially valuable discussion among watching families.Michael B Jordan does double duty as the show’s executive producer and Dion’s late father (though his body was never found, folks! Just saying.) He is seen in flashback and was a man always on the hunt for new discoveries and a bit of a Heath Robinson-esque inventor in his garage. He supposedly died saving a stranger, Charlotte Tuck, during a hurricane, though when Nicole finds Tuck’s name and number – uh – tucked away in an old shirt of her husband’s as she clutches it for comfort, the mystery of quite what happened deepens.There might not be much, narratively, that is new to adult viewers – but is there ever? Still, it is a fresh twist and the evocation of incorruptible Spielbergian innocence that is maintained by centring the show on such young protagonists is restorative to the ageing, battered soul, even if the head cries out that it could have been compressed into six episodes to no detriment and probably quite some benefit. For younger viewers it will all be new. And, as with all superhero stories, suitably ancient at the same time. That is their ageless delight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e328249a99441499958dc15380a50a0531866742/0_219_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc5efcaeaf8e93eb4667ae2a16cc50bc","title":"hong kong leader to ban face masks as she activates colonial era powers","story":"Carrie Lam warned against ‘slip towards authoritarianism’ as leak reveals police relaxed guidelines on lethal force Hong Kong’s leader plans to use harsh colonial-era emergency powers for the first time, banning face masks in a bid to curb the city’s protests.Opposition politicians warned it represented a slide towards authoritarianism and risked further inflaming tensions.Adding to concerns about a hardline government approach, a leaked memo showed police had relaxed their guidelines on using lethal force the day before a teenage student was shot in the chest, the first live-ammunition injury since protests began in June.Police have insisted the officer acted lawfully, and the 18-year-old student, who is still being treated in hospital, was charged with rioting and assaulting a police officer.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, was expected to announce details of the face mask ban on Friday, local media reported, in response to chaotic violence across the city on China’s national day, 1 October.Lam was at a gala in Beijing celebrating 70 years of communist rule while pitched battles were fought in the streets of her city between police and protesters, but since her return she has been under heavy pressure from pro-China groups to use the sweeping powers bequeathed by the British.The emergency regulations ordinance was introduced in 1922 so colonial authorities could break up strikes paralysing the ports. It allows the government to make any regulations it considers in the public interest, if it decides the city faces “an occasion of emergency or public danger”.Measures imposed could include censorship, control or suppression of the media, arrests, detentions, deportations, and seizure of property. The legislature can only amend or repeal any law passed under the emergency regulations once it has already been implemented.The regulations are considered so extreme that they have not been used for over half a century, and never deployed since the 1997 handover to Chinese sovereignty.“The emergency regulations are the start of a slip towards an authoritarian state,” a lawmaker, Dennis Kwok, said at a news conference, adding that he did not expect any form of government crackdown to end the protest movement.“The yearning for freedom, democracy and liberty are not going to go away just because you bring in more draconian regulations,” he said.A ban on masks would appear to be a limited use of emergency powers, but government critics say they believe it could serve as a way to test public and legal reaction, and pave the way for more extensive controls.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically-motivated extraditions into China\u0027s much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong\u0027s leader Carrie Lam introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says that the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British Union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white t-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protestors are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word \u0027riot\u0027 in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to tear gas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of \u0027doxxing\u0027 using digital techniques to unmask police and protestors as a new front in the battle.Police are reported to have shot a protestor with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People\u0027s Republic of China.The government’s legal position has changed enormously, however, since the powers were last used in 1967, to quell riots linked to the Cultural Revolution.Hong Kong today has its own mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which protects human rights and which some experts believe trumps even the emergency regulations.“In my view it is incorrect to view the ordinance as a blanket power for the government,” said Stuart Hargreaves, an associate professor in the law faculty at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “There is nothing in it that overrides the requirement that all other laws comply with the Basic Law.”Because an anti-mask law would affect freedom of assembly guaranteed under the Basic Law, if someone challenged it a court could ask the government for a legal defence of its position, he said.“This does not mean the government cannot introduce an anti-mask law it means that the emergency regulations ordinance is not a trump card over constitutional rights.” Hong Kong courts had been receptive to limits on freedom of expression in the past but any ban would need to be tested, he added.The ban aims to strike at morale and protester numbers by persuading people to stay away from gatherings for fear they will be identified. Face coverings have become a common uniform for those scared of arrest now or longer-term retaliation from Hong Kong or Chinese authorities.But it is unclear how it would work in practice. Crowds have turned out in their thousands for demonstrations denied police permits – even though they are technically illegal.It is also unclear whether the ban would only apply at protests or be applied more widely. Wearing face masks for health reasons is common in Hong Kong.Activists said they expected mass displays of civil disobedience, and if large numbers still marched with face masks police would not have the capacity to arrest them all or space to hold them. However, officers might try to make an example of some iniduals as a deterrent.The fact that most police are masked – and would likely be exempt from any ban – is likely to add to frustrations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18407c895b113f9566f1777cb2849d74641e1c3/173_709_3859_2315/master/3859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd11f5564f8762258e970b9df83b02cb","title":"arab wineries in israel tell of the palestinian struggle in each glass","story":"Restaurants that want to avoid the drink made on controversial settlements are the main clientsThe rolling green hills of Galilee were rife with wine presses back in crusader times. Today, the fertile land is part of a booming Israeli wine industry.But two wineries serve up a different story with every glass: the Arab-Palestinian tradition of winemaking.Ashkar winery, located near the border with Lebanon, and Jascala winery, further east in upper Galilee, are the only commercial Palestinian-owned wineries inside Israel.“We fill a niche,” said Nemi Ashkar during a tour of his winery in Kafir Yassif. His main clients are Arab-owned restaurants in cities such as Nazareth, Haifa and Acre, as well as restaurants in Tel Aviv seeking to avoid wine made on controversial Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. He also sells to the famed Israeli chef Yotam Ottolenghi.Ashkar is a Palestinian citizen of Israel, also called Israeli Arabs, who comprise close to a fifth of Israel’s citizens. His family is Christian and part of the Arab communities that remained in Israel after its founding in 1948. Another 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled, and their descendants today remain refugees. Israel’s Arab citizens have historically played a marginal role in national politics but the country’s Arab-majority parties are now a core part of the bloc in Israel’s parliament trying to oust the long-standing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after communities turned out in high numbers in the latest election.For Ashkar, the most important part of his business is the label inscribing each bottle, designed by his daughter, a graphic designer. It shows Iqrit, his family’s ancestral home, and its church, which is all that remains after Israeli authorities destroyed the village in 1951. “I’m telling the story of Iqrit with this wine,” he said.Amid the fighting in 1948, the 500 residents of Iqrit voluntarily left with a promise from Israeli forces that they could return soon. It never happened. Instead, after the war, Israel placed Arab communities in the new country under military rule. On Christmas Eve of 1951, Israel razed the village, destroying everything but the Greek Catholic church and adjacent cemetery.The now 1,700-strong Iqrit community, mostly living in northern Israel, has been fighting in court to reclaim their land, so far to no avail. “We will return, I am sure, despite the 70 years of evacuation,” said Ashkar.An unmarked and unpaved track leads up to Iqrit’s church, where the community gathers once a month for services, as well as for funerals. What remains of the village feels as if it’s on top of the world, isolated from the passage of time by gentle breezes and engulfed by waves of green hills all around.Winemaking had long been a favourite pastime in Iqrit. While alcohol is forbidden in Islam, wine was popular among Arab Christians, although its presence in the Middle East has severely diminished over the last century.“It was a hobby,” Ashkar said. “My family and my grandparents were winemakers just for family use.” Back then, they used uncultivated, native grapes for a sweeter taste than today’s wines from commercial varieties.The Ashkar family’s love of winemaking did not diminish with their move to Kafir Yassif, 30 km away. But it wasn’t until 2005 when Ashkar, working in Israel’s tech industry, took a work trip to Silicon Valley and felt inspired by the winegrowers of northern California. He started making wine again and in 2010 founded the winery.The first vineyard Ashkar bought grapes from is run by a Jewish-Israeli man, on land he said used to be part of Iqrit. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Israel’s lands authority confiscated Iqrit’s land, as it did for other depopulated Arab-Palestinian villages, and now through various bodies loans some of this land out. In practice, it’s extremely difficult for a non-Jewish citizen to lease state land.Ashkar said he had good business relations and was now friends with the owner of the vineyard. As he moved into the commercial market in 2009, he started to buy grapes from two other nearby vineyards without an Iqrit connection and, a decade later, is looking to expand again.Jascala winery, in the village of Jish, has a similarly deeply rooted story. Winemaking was a long-standing tradition for the Kharish family, also Christian, and in 2003 they decided to start something more formal.Brothers Nasser and Richard are now the heart of the operation: Nasser, 40, cultivates the grapes, and Richard, 44, is the winemaker.Nasser had just finished a degree in political science when he returned home to help his ageing father with the farming, then being done by workers from Thailand. He decided to stay.“I feel really connected to the land,” he said of life on the vineyard. “It’s different from anything I’ve done in my life. It’s so satisfying … All of the time you’re dealing with something that grows with you.”Jascala now makes 30,000 bottles a year and sells it mainly in Ramallah and Jerusalem, as well as Haifa, Nazareth and Tel Aviv.There is, however, a limited market within Israel for non-kosher wine: both Ashkar and Jascala are not kosher according to the Jewish dietary restrictions that dominate Israel’s food market. Kosher wine can only be produced by Sabbath-observing Jews in regulated conditions or alternatively boiled, which lessens the quality. An Israeli citizen, Nasser Kharish, said he also identified as Palestinian, which “is difficult for Jewish Israelis to hear that. But it’s true. I’m Palestinian. I’m part of the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/670b66585d8d5522ddc1883d5dfdf8e411414afb/0_200_4380_2628/master/4380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd1627fc94009b4bc5a65ce8409008b4","title":"russia is helping china build a missile defence system putin says","story":"Days after Beijing unveils state-of-the-art missiles, Moscow reveals plan that would ‘radically enhance China’s defence capability’Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow is helping China build a system to warn of ballistic missile launches.Since the cold war, only the United States and Russia have had such systems, which involve an array of ground-based radars and space satellites. The systems allow for early spotting of intercontinental ballistic missiles.Speaking at an international affairs conference in Moscow on Thursday, Putin said Russia had been helping China develop such a system. He added that “this is a very serious thing that will radically enhance China’s defence capability”.His statement signalled a new degree of defence cooperation between the two former Communist rivals that have developed increasingly close political and military ties while Beijing and Washington have sunk into a trade war.In June, Chinese president Xi Jinping called Putin his “best and bosom friend,” adding he cherished their “deep friendship.”There was no immediate comment from Beijing, but Putin’s claim got a mixed reaction online. On China’s Twitter-like social media platform Weibo, some users cheered “new heights in strategic cooperation”, but others questioned whether Beijing needed Russia’s help with military hardware.“Once again, Russian bragging! Maybe its linked to their national culture,” said one user. “Chinese wouldn’t brag like that”.Earlier this week China debuted new military hardware including a “hypersonic” missile experts believe could be difficult for the US to counter. The missile, known as the DF-17, can in theory manoeuvre sharply at many times the speed of sound, making it extremely difficult to defend against.In August China and Russia accused the United States of stoking a new arms race by testing a cruise missile, just weeks after Washington withdrew from a cold-war era missile control treaty that would have barred the test launch.The ground-launched missile, a conventionally-configured version of the nuclear-capable Tomahawk cruise missile, hit its target after over 500 kilometres of flight during the test, the Pentagon said in a statement.Ground-launched versions of the missile had been removed from service decades ago, after the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty was signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987.The treaty’s ban on missiles with ranges between 500km and 5,500km aimed to reduce the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike at short notice.Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, condemned the launch, but said Moscow was not looking to start a new arms race, and would not deploy any new missiles unless the US did first.Beijing also attacked the US, warning that the missile test could lead to “another round of the arms race”, and have a “serious negative impact” on international and regional security.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang.

Also listed are members of developer Johnny Ronan’s family, including his brother Conor and Conor’s wife, Claire. Mr Ronan was a director of Treasury Holdings.Spencer Dock was constructed as a landmark development, with some apartments boasting their own pools. When the apartment scheme was launched in 2002, people queued in the rain on the first day viewings were available.Up to €150 million was spent acquiring units in the development in the days after they came to market, it was reported at the time. Even in recent years, duplex apartments at the scheme sold for €900,000-€1.45 million.Pyrite actionsWell-placed sources said the action, while taken in the name of the property owners, had been initiated by the firm that provided insurance warranties to those purchasing units. The company, Premier Guarantee, has previously taken out similar actions in Ireland on behalf of homeowners who have experienced difficulties with pyrite.The defendants include a subsidiary company of construction giant Sisk, which was responsible for the overall project, as well as a dozen other engineering and design firms.Among the firms listed as defendants is architect firm Scott Tallon Walker, which designed the scheme. The firm’s managing director is also listed as a plaintiff, but sources suggested this was probably due to him being an apartment owner at the scheme.A property fund linked to Davy stockbrokers is also listed as a plaintiff.Three directors of the owner’s management company, a corporate entity composed of apartment owners in a block and responsible for maintenance and upkeep, are also listed.When contacted on Thursday, several parties listed as plaintiffs said they had no knowledge of the legal action. Sources with knowledge of the matter said this was because the insurer was taking the action in their names rather than the owners taking the action themselves.No commentA spokesman for Sisk had no comment when contacted. The management agent for the apartment development did not return a request for comment, while efforts to contact Scott Tallon Walker were unsuccessful.While apartments in the scheme are still in demand, and can rent for upwards of €4,500 a month, it has been affected by a series of alleged building defects. Most recently, an agent acting on behalf of receivers now responsible for some apartments in the development wrote to tenants in relation to “potential defects in the window frames of the apartments”.It is understood that water ingress has been detected around the frames of the windows.Sources said the action was probably being taken to aid Premier Guarantee in recouping any charges it had already been hit with, or may be hit with in the future. Purchasers would have, along with their apartment, bought a warranty from Premier Guarantee at the time of purchase.Premier Guarantee did not reply to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4039523.1570171267!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"moore street traders may shut up shop after 200 years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Moore Street in Dublin: a document     signed by 17 traders,   indicating that they wish to exit their licence agreement,  has been sent to Dublin City Council. Photograph:  Laura Hutton  Dublin’s 200-year-old Moore Street market could be consigned to history following indications from traders that they are prepared to shut-up shop.A document entitled “Licence holders who wish to be considered to exit the market” signed by 17 traders who hold casual trading licences to operate on Moore Street has been sent to Dublin City Council.Assistant council chief executive Dick Brady, who has responsibilty for casual trading, said the 17 signatories correspond with the number of licence holders on the street.A recent report from the Government-appointed Moore Street Advisory Group highlighted the decline of the markets, citing a lack of facilities such as toilets and problems with antisocial behaviour and criminality, including drug dealing, illegal cigarette selling and assaults.In August, the council closed the Victorian-era indoor fruit and vegetable market on nearby Mary’s Lane, paying compensation understood to be in the region of €5 million to the wholesalers operating there. However, Mr Brady said those traders had property leases and the same legal rights do not apply to casual trading licences.“Casual trading licences last for one year only and can be suspended by the council as necessary. They are not leases on property, they are licences to trade on a particular site on a public street and there is no compensatable interest attached to them,” he said, adding that the letter from the traders had not been accompanied by any request for compensation.‘Dire straits’Independent Dublin Central TD Maureen O’Sullivan, who sent the document to the council on behalf of the traders, said they were seeking a meeting with the council to determine their future. “There is no doubt they are in dire straits at the moment and a frank and open discussion is needed immediately in relation to their future,” she said. In addition to the neglect of the market and crime on the street, the proposed development of its east side by UK property group Hammerson would inevitably cause difficulties for the traders, she said.“When development starts it is likely they will not be able to continue trading for a considerable period. They need to know what their options are, whether that’s a suspension of their licence or if it would be preferable to consider relinquishing their licences.”Fruit and vegetable seller Tom Cullen said Moore Street market was being deliberately neglected by the council. “If the street was cleaned up, we would stay here, but we are being completely ignored and dumped on.”Moore Street trader Margaret Hanway said the council had repeatedly claimed it had no money to upgrade the market. “We asked for proper street lights, they say they have no money, but they can find €5 million for the people in the market?”Dublin\u0027s fruit and flower sellers to pack up their stalls"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4039982.1570169896!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm lorenzo leaves thousands along west coast without power","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Lahinch, Co Clare,  as storm Lorenzo mades landfall overnight.

But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.Sales also fell 0.7 per cent and bosses warned that the company will continue to struggle in the second half of the year if market conditions do not improve, pointing out that the warm weather in September is already having a negative impact.The fashion brand also suffered from the troubles of Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK and Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the US – department stores where Ted Baker had a significant presence.It took a hit of £600,000 from the collapse of House of Fraser alone.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chairman David Bernstein said: “Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition.“The group’s performance has been impacted by very difficult trading conditions throughout the period, amplified by heightened levels of consumer uncertainty across many of Ted Baker’s global markets.“The financial results we delivered in the first half were behind our expectations.

This is the first below-50 reading since March when Britain was last facing a no-deal crash-out from the EU.Analysts said this\u0026nbspheadline measure may be too downbeat, partly because the services PMI does not include the retail and public sectors\u0026nbspwhere activity has held up well recently.\u0026nbspNonetheless, the latest survey, together with polls on UK manufacturing and construction released earlier, is “probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity”, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAlthough she still thinks GDP grew slightly in the July-September quarter, the risks to that forecast “appear to be firmly to the downside”, Ms Gregory added.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberThe September PMIs for the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors came in at 48.3 and 43.3 respectively, signalling a\u0026nbspdeeper contraction than in services.\u0026nbspSumming up the results of the three PMIs, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS​ Markit, which compiles the surveys, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses.”Employment in manufacturing and construction also fell over the month. The reduction in construction was the steepest since December 2010.The labour market has been resilient this year, with the employment rate hovering around a record high. However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit. The argument goes that firms can let workers go if their sales drop, whereas investment in machinery is a more permanent expense.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 337 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 537 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 637 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 937 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1437 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1737 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2037 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2237 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272537 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3637 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3737 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 237 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

There were other factors, political factors.”Eccleston said the way his departure from the show was portrayed in the media caused him to temporarily lose confidence as an actor and to get blacklisted from shows.His confidence, he said, came back when he played John Lennon in\u0026nbspLennon Naked, the 2010 BBC Four biopic dedicated to the musician.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It appears to have been doing so as far as back as 10 billion years ago, when it was just forming, and those faint traces of smaller galaxies can still be seen to this day.Astronomers hope that the research can shed light on how our own galaxy will eventually be swallowed, and how it will come to its end.

Those show the signs of the ancient feasts, during which Andromeda would swallow its closer neighbours.That allowed them to see the fossils of long-dead galaxies, using them to understand the galaxies as they were when they lived, in the same way that fossils on Earth could shed light on ancient lives and deaths.By tracing the faint remains of these smaller galaxies with embedded star clusters, we\u0027ve been able to recreate the way Andromeda drew them in and ultimately enveloped them at the different times, Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the study helps answer important questions about the fate of our galaxy, it also opens up new questions and mysteries. Scientists say that Andromeda\u0027s two rounds of feeding came from entirely different directions.This is very weird and suggests that the extragalactic meals are fed from what\u0027s known as the \u0027cosmic web\u0027 of matter that threads the universe, said Professor Lewis from the Sydney Institute for Astronomy and University of Sydney School of Physics, who co-led the study with Dr Mackey.More surprising is the discovery that the direction of the ancient feeding is the same as the bizarre \u0027plane of satellites\u0027, an unexpected alignment of dwarf galaxies orbiting Andromeda.Those planes can be torn up by Andromeda\u0027s own gravity within the space of a few billion years, according to previous research by the same scientists.This deepens the mystery as the plane must be young, but it appears to be aligned with ancient feeding of dwarf galaxies. Maybe this is because of the cosmic web, but really, this is only speculation, Professor Lewis said.We\u0027re going to have to think quite hard to unravel what this is telling us.Astronomers also hope that the discovery could help us to learn more about our own galaxy, and how it will continue to evolve.One of our main motivations in studying astronomy is to understand our place in the Universe. A way of learning about our galaxy is to study others that are similar to it, and try to understand how these systems formed and evolved.\u0026nbspSometimes this can actually be easier than looking at the Milky Way, because we live inside it and that can make certain types of observations quite difficult.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.Sales also fell 0.7 per cent and bosses warned that the company will continue to struggle in the second half of the year if market conditions do not improve, pointing out that the warm weather in September is already having a negative impact.The fashion brand also suffered from the troubles of Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK and Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the US – department stores where Ted Baker had a significant presence.It took a hit of £600,000 from the collapse of House of Fraser alone.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chairman David Bernstein said: “Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition.“The group’s performance has been impacted by very difficult trading conditions throughout the period, amplified by heightened levels of consumer uncertainty across many of Ted Baker’s global markets.“The financial results we delivered in the first half were behind our expectations.

The reduction in construction was the steepest since December 2010.The labour market has been resilient this year, with the employment rate hovering around a record high. However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit.

They saw it as an issue that should be fixable.”Iran has a plan B thanks to China and Russia – and it might beat TrumpScholars also say the rising clout of Afghans inside Iran may have also prodded the Council of s to go against its ultra-conservative track record and approve the law.\u0026nbspThat thousands of Afghan migrants took up arms in the Iranian effort to bolster Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria may have boosted the image of Afghans in conservative circles that dominate the judiciary.“The state has to increasingly pay attention to them over time,” said Kevan Harris, a sociologist specialising in Iran at the University of California in Los Angeles. “And not all of these families are poor. There is a rising Afghan-headed middle class.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailZuzanna Olszewska, a\u0026nbspUniversity of Oxford\u0026nbspanthropologist specialising in the Afghan population of Iran, estimated about 100,000 children of Afghan fathers and Iranian mothers in Iran. They are among\u0026nbsphundreds of thousands of Afghans who\u0027ve lived in Iran since the beginning of their countries wars in the 1980s without paths to naturalisation.\u0026nbspMany of them have lived in the country for up to four decades, have contributed enormously to the economy in back-breaking jobs, and have gone about quietly improving their situations through education and hard work, she said. They have also integrated well into Iranian urban neighbourhoods, share Iranian culture, speak Persian with an Iranian accent, and a large proportion are also committed\u0026nbspShi\u0027a\u0026nbspMuslims. This probably accounts for their growing voice in the country\u0027s political life.Demographic factors including an ageing workforce and declining birth rates have made Iran friendlier towards immigration.\u0026nbspMr Harris also suggested that there was rising pressure from international organisations such as the UN\u0026nbspHigh Commission on Refugees, which continues to bankroll projects in Iran for those escaping conflicts in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan.\u0026nbspTo pass the law, parliament had to give way on security screening for anyone obtaining citizenship, which allowed\u0026nbspthe intelligence branch of the Revolutionary Guard to vet any applicant.\u0026nbspThe new rules don’t completely equalise access to citizenship. Iranian women must still apply for nationality for their children, while it is automatic for men’s children.“The children of all citizens, whether men or women, should instead be granted citizenship on an equal basis,” the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said earlier this year.\u0026nbspDespite the caveats, those inside Iran celebrated the change as a step forward. Any law that improves the lives of\u0026nbspIranian people is a step forward, said one Tehran social scientist, who spoke on condition her name not be published. There are so many limitations in Iran that each step forward is a good one.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Or how about Not A Cluedo, Rabble, Trivial Pursuits . or Angry Hippo-crites  Any of which could adequately describe the antics of our supposedly honourable MPs.Meanwhile, run and hide — for despite the fact we have merely placed one foot over the threshold of October, the genuine “must-have” Christmas toy predictions have already been released by, surprise, surprise, leading toy store Hamleys.Remember the days when — cue violins — all we could hope for was a spinning top and a satsuma Well, now that we have electricity and a Queen on the throne, boy oh boyhave times moved on.Coding Critters, anyone  According to one website, this toy uses simple buttons sized for little hands, so “preschoolers learn early STEM concepts through  per cent screen-free coding challenges”. Great. Hopefully, toddlers can then teach us how to master it.

After you.Then we have Pictionary Air, a modern twist on the original that uses an app so players can draw in the ether and see the image on a screen.There’s also a cashless version of Monopoly that presumably removes all the family arguments accusing the chosen banker of nicking money.Where’s the fun in that Top of the must-haves, though, is the £ Scruff-A-Luvs pet that arrives in need of TLC, can be washed and fluffed to perfection and emits whimpers and sighs.Just like Boris Johnson, when he was being prepped for his appearance on The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.Whatever we end up buying for the little ones in the family this Christmas, what’s the betting that after a flurry of ripping, locating batteries, reading instructions and an hour or two of fevered playing, this year’s “must-have” toys will be tossed to one side in favour of something that needs nothing except imagination and commitment — just like the good old days.Brexit the board game, anyone  No, thought not.AFTER the Supreme Court ruling to overturn the prorogation of Parliament, some have suggested it’s a political judgment, which means we should be told the balance of Remainer Leavers on the .Something tells me that the scales of those justices will be tipped very firmly in one direction.The BBC has overturned its decision to publicly admonish presenter Naga Munchetty for her comments about Donald Trump’s “racist”language.Quite right, too. Around  years ago, as co-presenter of BBC’s live TV show Crimewatch Daily, I interviewed a man called Mick North.Mr North was a lecturer in biochemistry at Stirling University in Scotland and, shortly after giving birth to their daughter Sophie, his we Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer and died just two and a half years later – leaving him with a toddler to bring up alone.On March , , he dropped Sophie – by then aged five – at school and headed off to work.The school was Dunblane Primary and she was shot dead by social misfit Thomas Hamilton who, armed with the four guns and  cartridges he owned legally, massacred  pupils and one teacher.In , after writing a book about the tragedy, Mr North came on the show to tell his heart-breaking story and to explain why, in , he had joined the Gun Control Network to campaign for tighter vetting.Sympathising with a man who had lost his daughter in such unconscionable circumstances, I simply said something along the lines of, “I’m not surprised” – a comment seized upon as “partisan” by the gun lobby, who then bombarded the BBC with complaints.The next day I was forced to apologise on air.Yes, it’s important that those presenting on the BBC are seen to be impartial when discussing politics but, be it Naga, citing her own experiences of racism or, in my case, sympathising with a man asking for tighter gun laws after his young daughter was shot dead, these are human reactions that should be judged using common sense, not boiler-plate rules.IN Debbie Harry’s compelling memoir, Face It, she writes about the time David Bowie was backstage with her and rock star Iggy Pop.She says: “David pulled out his c*ck – asI were the official c*ck checker or something.“He loved to pull it out, with both men and women.

It spoilt our holiday.”But she added that their day in glitzy Monte Carlo had been brilliant, saying: “It was great to see how the other half live.”I’m not saying that passengers shouldn’t be compensated for their unscheduled night off the boat.But perhaps they should view their stay in the hall from the perspective of how another half live – namely the , homeless in the UK.One of them, -year-old David Bateman, was jailed for more than three years this week after using a craft kne to rob a Sainsbury’s store in Exeter then waiting outside until the police arrived.Why  Because he was so desperate for food and a bed that he wanted to go to prison.And as The Sun highlighted this week, around , of the homeless are ex-military being failed by councils when they ask for housing support.A camp bed in a warm hall would be luxury to them.On December , I will be taking part in The World’s Big Sleepout, which aims to raise funds for the homeless.If you would like to donate, or even take part, then details are on bigsleepout.With winter coming, we should each try to do something – however small – to help those less fortunate.COUNTRYFILE viewers have questioned why a special episode was called One Man And His Dog when three out of the four handlers were female.And let’s face it, it’s not very inclusive of our female pooches, either.Though One Handler And Their Bitch is perhaps a little too modern, even for . BORIS JOHNSON has shocked onlookers by practising his “signature move” of the double thigh-squeeze, in broad daylight.“First of all he reportedly squeezed the thighs of two women either side of him at a dinner party  years ago – and now here he is blatantly proving that it is indeed ‘a signature move’.WHEN pub landlord Nigel Smith learned that no babies born in  were given his Christian name, he decided to host a party for his namesakes.More than  of them turned up to The Fleece Inn, in Bretforton, Worcs.Last weekend, I went on an old-haunts pub crawl in the city of Worcester with four of my closest schoolmates – Wendy, Sue, Sonia and Carolyn.All names that, along with Jane, Jackie, Julie, Sandra, Ian, Gary, Geoff, Nigel and many other rapidly declining monikers, firmly date us as children of the Sixties.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in the case of the traditional media, he mustn’t wield the loss of his mother as a weapon to try to shut down valid criticism that questions why, for example, he preaches about climate change one day then climbs aboard a private jet the next.Princess Diana was media savvy and close friends with several influential journalists.In his recent memoir, former Vogue publisher Nicholas Coleridge relayed the story of a lunch they shared that he had gone to great s to keep secret.But as she left, he says four photographers, “sprang forward, taking a thousand snaps”.Another example of “Diana, the hunted” perhaps Later, Coleridge rang a newspaper friend to ask how the picture desk had known and got the reply: “Diana rang herself from her car, on her way to lunch. She often tips them off about where she’ll be.”Equally, on the night of her death, she was safely ensconced in the Paris Ritz but chose, at midnight, to leave in a car being driven by a man three times over the French drink-driving limit.That is not to say the media — and, in particular, the paparazzi — didn’t sometimes step out of line, but unlike her youngest son, Diana knew not to judge all by the actions of a few.Presumably, the Sussexes hope The Mail on Sunday will cave in before it gets to court, but the paper is insisting it will defend the action “vigorously”.If so, Thomas Markle will be the star witness, and potentially Meghan herself — an event that will draw far more publicity to the Duchess’s turbulent family background than any article we have all long forgotten about.During the South Africa tour, Harry told -year-old student Peter Oki he was so overwhelmed by the world’s problems that it was sometimes hard to get out of bed in the mornings.Perhaps he should try embarking on a tour of the UK, where millions of his subjects are coping with issues without the cushion of wealth and privilege he enjoys.Hard-working people who, after the daily grind of keeping their head above water, simply don’t have time to obsess over perceived slights.Of course, there is one sure-fire route to greater privacyHarry and Meghan desire it.Give up the royal title , get a full-time job and pay for your own house renovations, like the rest of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes she gave them to the adults, she bought me and my husband plates with jellied meat.She added: I remember it well because my husband said lets not eat it, you never know what it was made from, and now it looks like he was right.Tatyana said police told her the serial killer used the flesh of her victims to make the treats, but cops have not confirmed this.The claims have drawn comparisons to Sweeney Todd, a British Victorian tale about a killer barber who sells people pies made with human flesh.Zhukova’s first alleged victim was eight-year-old girl Anastasia Alexeenko who reportedly annoyed the OAP by playing too noisily.She is said to have been butchered after she cheekily threw ice cream at the pensioner when she told her to be quiet.The schoolgirl’s severed head was found in  with a severely battered face.At the time “fresh meat” was seen strewn near Zhukova’s apartment block, which was then eaten by stray dogs, a court heard.It was only  years later that forensic evidence was found in her flat linking her to the girl’s murder, allege prosecutors.The retired pig slaughterer was arrested after janitor Vasily Shlyakhtich, , who had agreed to rent a room in her apartment, vanished in January this year.His body parts were found in bins around Khabarovsk city, leading cops to search her flat.Inside, they allegedly found his “bowels and other inner organs” in her fridge, prompting speculation in the Russian press that she was a cannibal.She is also accused of killing pal Nina Babenko, , in April  after she too moved in as a lodger.The victim had recently sold her apartment and took the money with her when she went to live with  the killer.Ninas passport was discovered in Zhukova’s flat, but she was never seen again and her body was never found.Police are checking four further unsolved suspected murders in the area, say reports."},{"url":null,"title":"cheese grater remove tattoo pictured","story":"The man, who does not want to be named, was believed to have been  when he attempted the unorthodox tattoo removal method in Argentina.A pal named Martias Costas shared the images online showing what appears to be skin dangling of the mans wrist.Pictures of his bloodied arm have only just emerged, more than two years after the tattoo was said to have been removed.The man told local media at the time he removed the tattoo because he said it would hinder his job prospects.He tried to look up ways online on how to remove a tattoo at home.His first attempt was to use a pumice stone before he settled with a cheese grater.The bizarre removal method left him needing a vaccine.The lad told local media: I had the tattoo done and a week later I wanted to join the airport police.Although among the requirements on the website it is not mentioned, I was told that I could not work there with visible tattoos.This happened in August , I was  years old at the time.

How dare you!”The teen’s fiery speech was hailed by millions, with climate change activists taking to the streets in huge protests around the world.But others were less impressed, including Donald Trump who sarcastically mocked her as a “very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”.French President Emmanuel Macron also warned her “radical” climate change stance risks “depressing” an entire generation.And some iniduals were even more scathing, with sick trolls branding her “the little girl with mental problems”, and others suggesting she’s “not sexy enough” in vile rants.But Putin said young people who paid attention to environmental issues should be supported.However, he cautioned: “When someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned.“I’m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl.“But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.”But critics point out that despite signing up to the Paris climate agreement last month, Russia has long ignored the issue of climate change.In fact, it even stands to benefit economically as it looks to take advantage of the thawing Arctic to create a new shipping channel along its usually frozen northern coast.Putin himself has also said climate change isn’t man-made and expressed scepticism about renewable energy.He said wind turbines killed birds and disturbed worms – claims he was widely mocked for in Russia despite a law against insulting officials."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures superyachts monaco","story":"The mulit-million pound vessels radiate as they illuminate the water during the glamorous Monaco Yacht Show in Port Hercules.It is understood an estimated £.billion worth of vessels were on display during the opulent showcase.More than  yachts were showcased during the event, which has been running for almost three decades.The billionaires toys ranged from  feet to  feet in .Most yachts were moored up in the bay, but as space is limited others spend the night anchored further out to sea.A-listers such as actor Leonardo Di Caprio, former Beatle Ringo Starr, Tennis champion Novak Djokovic and F star Lewis Hamilton were said to be at the luxurious event, according to Boat International.The show is Europes largest in-water display of yacht and lasted from September  to .Earlier this year, one of the worlds largest and most futuristic superyachts had coasted into Monaco.Russian tycoon Andrey Melnichenko’s one-off £million vessel was designed by Philippe Starck and is ft long, has eight decks, a helicopter pad, a pool and masts that are ft tall.It is named Sailing Yacht A because the super wealthy industrialist likes his vessels to be listed first in shipping registers.Brothers JP Andrews and Mike Andrews, who are from Wolverhampton and specialise in aerial photography, captured the fantastic images using a drone.Mike, , said: We could see tenders shuttling back and forth from the land, which contained guests or occupants of the yachts but the majority of the people on board were inside enjoying the luxuries of their yachts.The glow in the water from the lighting was what sparked our interest.

Why  Because, for the EU, the aim was never to avoid a hard border in Ireland — something these proposals plainly achieve.The aim, rather, was to keep Britain in a subordinate position, still subject to EU law and trade policy.Brussels was reluctant to spell this out in so many words — at least publicly.A fly-on-the-wall documentary caught the staff of the European Parliament’s Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, cheering when Theresa May’s Cabinet accepted the backstop.“It took us two years,” said one, joyfully, “but we finally turned them into a colony”. Obviously, though, EU officials couldn’t take this line openly.So, instead of owning up that their goal was to keep Britain tied to their laws, they invented a story about avoiding border checks and making sure that violence did not come back to Irish politics.Still, there was a telling admission when the proposals first emerged earlier this week.Reporting on the Irish government’s response, RTE’s Tony Connelly tweeted: “The main argument against this approach is that all the technology in the world is of no usethe actual customs tarf makes your cross-border business unviable, especiallyyou’re in agrood.”In other words, it’s not about the border at all. It’s about maintaining privileged access to the UK market.At present, more than two thirds of all Irish beef exports come to the UK.Understandably, the last thing Dublin wants is for us to switch to cheaper and better beef from Australia, Argentina and the United States — something we would be able to do outside the EU’s trade rules.Many continental countries also want to make sure that Britain remains a captive market for their exporters.So when it became clear that the UK had come up with a way to avoid infrastructure at the Irish border, they moved the goalposts.What they now wanted was not an invisible border, they said, but common rules on both sides of it.Oddly, this applies only one way. No one regarded it as a threat to peace when, for example, the Republic of Ireland left the sterling zone and joined first the ERM and then the euro. But Britain signing its own trade deals is apparently unacceptable.To be fair to Eurocrats, the only reason they put these outrageous demands on the table was because there was a Remainer majority in both Houses of Parliament egging them on.The concept of keeping Britain in the customs union — or of an “Irish backstop” as Brussels officials cunningly called it — only appeared in late , more than a year after the referendum.Why  Because, by then, there had been a new election in the UK and there was now a pro-EU majority in the Commons.Labour and Lib Dem MPs told the EU, quite openly, that they would not let Britain leave except on terms agreed with Brussels — or “not without a deal” as they put it.The EU responded by offering deliberately unpalatable terms.It, like the opposition parties, plainly hopes that,the terms are hard enough, Britain will drop the whole idea of Brexit.As Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator, told EU leaders at the start of the process: “I’ll have done my job , by the end, the terms are so hard that the Brits would prefer to stay in.”What, then, will happen now  My guess is that the EU will reject Britain’s offer — even though it achieves all the things Brussels had said were important.It will do so because it believes the alternative is not No Deal — an outcome for which Britain is far better prepared than are the  — but yet another postponement.When MPs voted to make No Deal impossible, they were in fact making a deal impossible, because they were taking away from the EU any incentive to agree terms.If I am right —Brussels rejects the deal, and Parliament then demands another extension — we will be back where we started.But with one critical dference. It will now be obvious to the entire country that Boris was prepared to go as far as any British leader could to find a compromise.It will be clear that neither the EU nor its fth columnists in our own Parliament have any interest in any outcome short of reversing the referendum.Boris, in other words, will be able to go into a general election having demonstrated good faith.He will have done everything possible to leave on good terms, but will have been blocked by MPs who had previously promised to respect the result.Labour and the Lib Dems will, by contrast, have to go into that campaign explaining why, despite their earlier pledges, they now want to drag everything out again.Why they want months or years more of anger and broken friendships, of business uncertainty, and of Britain being made to look ridiculous before the world.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t. They settled instead on Japan With Sue Perkins, who went “in search of the country’s soul” by dressing up as a few cultural stereotypes and probably sending children to bed with nightmares in her geisha girl outfit.If WE did that, of course, “cultural appropriation” would be the least of the accusations made against us. But it seems to be all right here, I think, ’cos Sue’s a middle-class Cambridge graduate who reads the .No matter where she travels, Sue also remains ever-vigilant for the slightest hint of sexism and clearly thought she was guaranteed plenty of that at a government-sponsored speed-dating night, along with lots of other stuff tosspots like to describe as “problematic”.Soyou want to see irony squared, watch the moment towards the end of episode two when Sue grandly tells a whole room of uncomprehending dorks: “Formality permeates every part of Japanese culture. Everything’s driven by boundaries, rules and regulations. They’ve lost the fundamentals.”And then think: “Yeah, what this country really needs is a naked dating show where contestants are judged on the state of their genitals, hosted by Sue Perkins’ missus.”That’ll drag ’em into the st Century.The consistently brilliant Good Morning Britain finding the only Piers Morgan impersonator in Japan who wasn’t wearing a wrestling nappy.Richard Madeley’s cameo in The Circle.Celebrity MasterChef contestant Joey Essex inventing the “stirotto” , which looked about as appetising as a pandopsy .And Strictly’s Mike Bushell attempting the American smooth, with Katya Jones, to that all-time Glen Campbell classic Like A Blind Stoned Cowboy.AMERICAN trailer-trash comedian Vicki Barbolak accidentally locked herself in a pink caravan at the start of her routine on Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions. Then someone from production let her out and the problems really started.Two minutes into her act, Vicki came to a grinding halt and stuttered: “I . . . I . . . I changed everything I was going to do.” And decided to shove any good material down the caravan’s chemical toilet A horribly awkward moment for everyone, though not the first sign the booking process had seriously maled with this episode.That was the previous act – Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh, from Kazakhstan, whose “ceremony of sound” went where your iPhone alarm fears to tread, making the sort of random animal noises usually accompanied by the caption “footage courtesy of PETA”.British politeness rescued him from the silence that should have followed – along with David Walliams, who said: “People are not going to forget the name . . . sorry, I’ve forgotten your name.”What I definitely will remember about Saturday’s episode, though, is the timely question Simon Cowell posed to the act that followed Gennady and Vicki, Twist  Pulse: “The people who didn’t want to compete again.

For the Tories, it is a clear goal of policy.In his ambitious speech to the conference, the Chancellor Sajid Javid – who is the son of a bus driver – declared that the Living Wage would rise over the next five years from the present rate of £.-an-hour to £.-an-hour - and the age limit lowered from  to .Altogether, it is estimated that at least four million people will benefit from these far-reaching changes.The Chancellor’s scheme exposes all the left-wing nonsense about Tory toffs.This is not the action of a Government that is driven by concern only for the wealthy or is indferent to the struggles of those on limited earnings.A modern, thriving economy cannot be built on the back of exploitation and poverty pay.Anyone who goes out to work is entitled to a level of pay that can sustain a reasonable standard of living.Those who object to Sajid Javid’s proposal should be askedthey would be willing to work for less than £.-an-hour.In fact, it is depressing that so many people who do invaluable jobs in the community, like care home workers, hospitality staff and retailers are currently paid less than this.Looking after the elderly or disabled should be well-rewarded positions, not jobs hovering at the level of the minimum wage.Indeed, ever since they came to power in , the Conservatives have prioritised the quest to improve living standards and reward those who hold down jobs.That is why the Government has dramatically cut income tax for the low paid by raising the personal allowance from £,-a-year in  to £, this year.As a result, more than four million people who earn beneath this threshold no longer have to pay income tax at all.Meanwhile, contrary to all the rancid hysteria about alleged Tory bias to the rich, the top one per cent of earners now pay  per cent of all income tax.The Conservatives’ claim to be the party of the workers is further reinforced by their jobs miracle, which far exceeds anything achieved where in Europe.When the Tories took office in , there were widespread predictions that they would preside over soaring dole queues.Just the opposite happened. In the last nine years, no fewer than .million new jobs have been created, most of them full-time.Today, unemployment stands at just . per cent, the lowest level since . Over  per cent of the population is now in work, a historic record, with more women in the workplace than ever before and wages are now growing at their fastest rate in a decade.Inflation is low, while credit and mortgages have never been cheaper, which – along with tax cuts – boosts household budgets.Similarly, a consumer study out this week showed that expenditure on dining out is at its highest level for three years.Tory economic success, in the face of Labour’s hysterical gloom-mongering, points to a fundamental dference between the parties.The Conservatives believe in providing incentives towards diligence and enterprise.In contrast, Labour is ideologically obsessed with levelling down, trying to achieve a dogmatic form of equality through higher taxes, massive redistribution of wealth and lavish social security benefits.As history has continually taught us, it is a disastrous recipe for economic sclerosis and welfare dependency.Raising pay rather than benefits is the best way to bolster living standards.A generous welfare system is a heavy drag on the economy, not only because it imposes a huge burden on the taxpayer but also because it discourages work.On the other hand, a reasonable minimum wage raises productivity in the workplace, puts more money in the pockets of employees and expands the economy.The main objection to a higher minimum comes from employers, who argue that, because of rising costs, staff will be priced out of jobs - but there is little evidence to support such warnings.The same anxieties were voiced when Labour under Tony Blair first campaigned in  for the introduction of a minimum wage.At the time, the Tories said that policy would destroy jobs, particularly among young people. But such dire forecasts never materialised.Thankfully, the Conservatives have learnt that such messages of economic doom are hollow.It will turn our economy into a pioneer, with one of the highest statutory minimums in the world.Inevitably Labour has been carping this week, with the Shadow Chancellor bleating about the Tories’ pathetic attempt at catch-up.But such language just demonstrates Labour’s fear - as their mantle of the party of the workers is steadily pulled from their grasp."},{"url":null,"title":"bercow makes kangaroo testicle joke in commons","story":"Mr Bercow quipped on his croaky voice following the dig by the PM at the Tory party conference yesterday.The Speaker, who was suffering from a sore throat, told the Commons today: “I want to take the opportunity to confirm to the House that the state of my throat, which is purely temporary, is not down to the consumption of a kangaroo’s testicle.“I wouldn’t eat it, it would probably be poisoned.”The joke came after Boris told fellow MPs thatParliament were a TV show they all deserved to be “voted out” before taking a swipe at ardent Remainer Mr Bercow.Boris Johnson mocked the Commons for its efforts to block Brexit and joked that he would like to make Mr Bercow do a revolting Bush Tucker Trial.The Speaker - who once had a b****cks to Brexit sticker on his car - has infuriated Mr Johnson with what he sees as anti-Government bias over Brexit.Mr Johnson told Tory delegates: “If Parliament were a reality TV show then the whole lot of us Im afraid would have been voted out of the jungle by now.“But at least we would have the consolation of watching the speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle.”After the banter in the Commons, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom was quick to send Mr Bercow her own supportive message.She tweeted: Get well soon @HoC_Speaker_MP!

The breed of Heck was engineered by German zoologist brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck, who were commissioned by the Nazis. Derek has imported a herd of the breed onto his farm in Lton, Devon, in the hopes they will help his business flourish after Britain leaves the EU.    Derek said: The reason weaposre doing it is because farming is becoming increasingly uneconomic. Without the EU subsidies,we continued to farm we would be unprofitable. The breed of cows is aggressive and horned - and are thought to be the closest living relative to a historic species of bull called Aurochs. The cows are very large, they resemble cave paintings, Derek said. The Nazis wanted to go out and hunt them, thataposs why they were made.  Most of the breed were slaughtered after the Second World War, but after a lot of experimenting Mr Gow now has  of them on his land. Itaposs been an awful lot of work but I hope people will find it interesting. Derek, who is originally from Dundee, is renowned for his work reintroducing animals into nature.    He pioneered the captive breeding and reintroduction of water voles and played a key role in theof beavers to Britain. Last year Mr Gow had drawn up a briefing for ministers about the potential reintroduction of British wildcats.

Caitlin Greyling and her family arrived in the UK on December ,  and have built their lives here ever since. They came from Cape Town after Caitlin’s father got a job in Plymouth - leaving behind a le far dferent from one they have worked hard to create in the UK. Mum Vicky said: It was terrible. It was dangerous. We were living in fear most of the time. The community was great but the le of crime was not what we wanted our daughters to grow up in. When we did get the opportunity to move over to Plymouth we jumped at it. Now the family are desperately trying to raise the funds to pay for her citizenship application after being hit with the financial bombshell. Setting up a GoFundMe page to help raise the £, needed, they are appealing for help with their plight - or face their whole world being turned upside down, reports Plymouth Live.    Speaking about her old le in South Africa, Caitlin recalled not-so happy memories of her childhood home. She said: We had bars on our window, locks on every door. Our gate had to be chained up every night. My dad was part of Neighbourhood Watch and he would be chasing people away with paintball guns, because they couldn’t have real guns, but these looked realistic. Caitlin left South African school around age  and was surprised by the level of education she received in England, initially at All Saints Academy Plymouth and now at City College Plymouth. Caitlin said: “When I moved here I was really shocked at how much they were explaining everything, step-by-step. Spending a whole lesson on something. Making sure you’ve got the right resources and you didn’t have to pay for it. My teachers remember me as the one who said ‘have a nice day’ at the end of class. Jane Yilmaz taught Caitlin at All Saints and got in touch with Plymouth Live regarding Caitlin’s issue. On teaching Caitlin, she said: “I taught her throughout year . Caitlin was a dedicated and hard-working student. She would always go the extra mile and attend every opportunity for extra lessons. “She was such a friendly and mature young adult who without fail would say, aposHave a nice day Missapos at the end of every lesson. She was an absolute joy to teach.

George can already drive, pitch and putt the ball despite only celebrating his third birthday last month. His longest shot to date is  yards and earlier this year he completed an entire hole for the first time in  shots. The little lad regularly takes to the course with his own set of clubs and a tiny glove but he can’t wear golf shoes or clothing yet as no brand make them in his size. George’s golf mad granddad Tony Sedgwick, , sparked the youngster’s love of the game when he bought him a set of plastic toy clubs  months ago. “It’s really fun going to the golf range and to the golf course with my granddad,” George said. “I love whacking the golf ball.”  He added: “When I’m famous I’m going to buy my mummy a new house and granddad some new golf balls.” Business manager Tony recognised his grandson’s exceptional skill early on and nowadays the two can regularly be seen together at the -hole Wigan Golf Club. He said: “George just absolutely loves golf, he can’t get enough of it. “He loves going to the driving range and having a whack or even just coming to the course with me when I go for a round. “He’s definitely made me super proud.” The granddad-of-two added: “At the moment it’s all about him having fun but there’s no doubt he has a huge amount of natural talent. “He’s my little Rory McIlroy.”  Tony said George first picked a club up more than  months ago, when he stumbled across one of his in the back garden. “Even at such a young age you could tell he had a natural talent for the game,” Tony said. “The clubs were obviously too big and heavy for him but he was swinging away.” Not long after purchasing the lad plastic clubs Tony went all the way and got him a set of real ones in the smallest possible size. Within weeks George was successfully making solid contact with the ball.  His proud mum Louise Sedgwick, , had to ban him from using real balls in the garden after he nearly smashed the conservatory window.

Louise, who’s now training to be an organ transplant nurse, said: “George was very young when Dave died but the tragedy has still definitely had an impact on him. “Sometimes he’ll cry and ask for his daddy, which is heartbreaking but we make sure we talk about Dave all the time so he’s a part of George’s le.” She added: “Golf has been a brilliant thing for George to focus on since his dad died. “It’s amazing to see how well he’s doing despite everything he’s been through.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hoarder trapped hallway 30 years","story":"NewsHoarder trapped in hallway for  years sobs as she is rescued from messThe woman was forced to sleep in a deckchair at the property in Maidstone, Kent - until a house clearing company saved her from the mountains of rubbishShareCommentsByGregory Kirby:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video inside-hoarders-bungalow-of-clutter-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news hoarder-trapped-hallway--years-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The woman had lived with an elderly relative, who was a hoarder, and filled their home with so much stuff they had to sleep in deckchairs by the front door for three decades. After the homeowner died, the pensioner endured the filth until a removals firm heard about her plight - and cleared the home for free. Kent-based removals firm Klutter King spent a week cleaning the house from top to bottom - and moved more than  tonnes of rubbish to the tip. Owner Kevin Porter said: The poor tenant began lodging with the relative in the early s. The relativeaposs compulsive hoarding got worse when her partner died.  We found piles of clothes, shoes, books, umbrellas and rotting food tins all over the house when we arrived. The food cans had been there for so long the contents had vanished and the tins were crumbling. The relative, who owned the property in Maidstone, Kent, died in , by which time the pensioner was too frail to sht the waste. Mr Porter, , of East Peckham, Kent, added: Iaposve cleared a lot of houses since forming the company. In most cases itaposs when someone has died or moved into a care home. But this one got me emotionally because of how this person had been made to live. They didnapost even have a bed and in the summertime they slept in the garage because it was too hot. Itaposs such a sad story. To make things worse, the landlady left the property to charity and not the relative.  It took six men seven days to clear decades of junk, which involved dozens of trips to the tip. Mr Porter added: It was so satisfying to finish because it seemed like the job was never going to end. At the halfway point I thought aposwhat am I doing , because we didnapost think we would ever finish. The tenant asked the clearance team to look out for a £, piece of jewellery which had become lost in the rubbish. The team were not hopeful they would find it, but eventually uncovered the lost treasure and ed it to the delighted owner. Mr Porter said: Most clearance companies make their profits from selling on expensive items. We donapost do that. I havenapost got it in me. The owner couldnapost believe it when we ed the jewellery. After the mess had been shted, the team mopped the floors and cleaned the walls which had been blocked for years.

However, earlier this year Emily began experiencing night sweats, bloating, kidney pain and fatigue before she was eventually given the devastating news in March that she had germ cell oian cancer.

Emily began chemotherapy immediately, followed by surgery to remove the seven-inch tumour.    The cancer diagnosis derailed the coupleaposs plans to live together, but Dave made the decision to quit his job in Vancouver to move to London permanently so he could support Emily. Emily believes that the months spent living together in London deeply strengthened their relationship because he remained by her side throughout her cancer battle. She said: The afternoon of my diagnosis, I met with a gynaecological oncology surgeon to discuss my options. It was shocking to hear all of this over a few hours. Then a few days later, I had a CT scan to determine whether the cancer had spread, fortunately it hadnapost. My GP said that based on the results of the CT, and the size and speed of tumour growth, I would undergo four to six months of chemotherapy to shrink the tumour before they operated. Dave arrived in London on March , and he came to an appointment with my oncologist where we were hoping to arrange a treatment plan for when I ed to Vancouver. What we were told instead was that the tumour was too aggressive, and Iaposd be starting chemotherapy that evening! After being told the shocking news of how aggressive her cancer was, Emily said Dave immediately made the decision to quit his job to be at her side.    She added: Dave and I walked to a nearby park. It was there that he told me that he was going to quit his job and move to London. I was so relieved, but I was also so angry because cancer hadnapost only taken over my le, it had taken over his too. Emily began chemotherapy at the end of March before having surgery on May  to remove the tumour, which was seven inches long and over three inches wide. Surgeons also removed her right oy, right fallopian tube, appendix and lymph nodes, leaving her with  staples in her sternum. In June, Emilyaposs oncologist permitted her toto Vancouver to complete her treatment as her recovery from surgery was going well. Emily said she was proud of what their relationship has endured, adding: The one positive thing about the cancer diagnosis was that we got to live together sooner than weaposd planned, even though the situation wasnapost quite what we had planned.

Nicola Bevan told bosses she would need to take an emergency leave of absence from her job as a registered community health nurse. But while continuing to receive her monthly wage, the -year-old was running her private business, Youthful You Wales in Pencoed, which offered anti-ageing products including Botox injections.After Bevan’s line manager became suspicious an investigation was launched by the NHS counter-fraud team, reports Wales Online.Evidence was found on social media that she was trading.    They also discovered she had been duplicating prescriptions in order to obtain medications from pharmacies to be used in treatments. She did this to circumvent a process which required an independent prescriber to sign the prescription after taking into account the patient’s medical history. As well as avoiding paying fees to the independent prescriber, it was claimed Bevan put her patients at risk as they could have been given treatments that were dangerous for them. A sentencing hearing at Cardf Crown Court on Wednesday heard Bevan, of Pencoed, was employed by the Swansea Bay University Health Board and had worked as a nurse for  years. Prosecutor Carl Harrison said the defendant signed a contract at the beginning of her employment agreeing not to carry out private medical work without the permission of the health board.    Bevan remained on sick leave from December  to June  during which time she received a total of £, in wages. Since her conviction she has fully repaid the amount she received during this period, the court heard. In regards to the prescription fraud, the defendant had duplicated  prescriptions. When confronted about her behaviour Bevan denied she had been working but later admitted to running a business while on sick leave. She also initially claimed she believed prescriptions could be submitted twice to a pharmacy. The defendant later pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud and one count of dishonestly failing to disclose information to make a gain for herself. The court heard she had previous convictions for the possession and production of cannabis.

The move by Heworth Grange School in Gateshead has been branded a joke and left dozens of mums and dads scratching their heads over the timing. A letter was issued to parents announcing the new £. branded polo shirts bought during the summer holidays were being replaced by plain white shirts and a tie.And it has caused uproar as families are having to fork out more money on top of the expense they faced just weeks ago, reports Chronicle Live.School bosses say the polo shirts will now be used for PE and the tie is free - which just leaves the shirt or blouses to be bought. A fund has been set aside for those in hardship and cannot afford the shirts.    The new unorm came into play on October  and school bosses say the vast majority of staff and students have responded very positively to the change. However mum Samantha Matfin is absolutely furious. I am so angry and so are a lot of other parents, she said. I bought polo shirts with the school logo on for my daughter ing to school last month and now they are changing the unorm. This doesn’t teach kids the value of money at all. It’s a joke, it really is. “It’s just four weeks since she went back to school and now there is a change. I rang the lady at the school and said why can’t we have a meeting and discuss this first. I thought that February in the half term break would have been a better time to introduce this, so at least the kids can get a bit of wear out of them. Just let us get Christmas out of the way and then bring in the shirts. Samantha added: “I bought three white polo shirts and two blue polos for PE, all at £.. Now they say she can wear them all for PE that she has once a week. It really is a joke.”  Owen Englis took over the position as interim headteacher at the school at the start of the term and changes are being made. In a letter produced on September  it said: “We are delighted to introduce ourselves as the senior team at Heworth Grange. “We are taking on the leadership at a very exciting stage in the school’s journey and we will be working very hard to ensure that we secure very positive outcomes for the students we serve. It continues: “As part of the change to leadership, we are also focusing on standards of unorm and behaviour. We make no excuses for the high expectations at Heworth Grange, students who look good and feel positive are more likely to achieve. As a result, we are introducing a few changes to the standards of students at the school. The letter goes on to say that as of October , students must wear a plain white shirt blouse with a collar and a school jumper at all times. It adds that polo shirts will now be for PE only but they can wear either blue or white ones.Parents have also voiced their anger on Facebook with one mum saying she paid £ for her sonaposs unorm in time for September.She added: No way am I going and buying new stuff.” "},{"url":null,"title":"school scraps traditional terms parents","story":"NewsSchool scraps traditional terms so parents can take kids on holiday at any timeFee-paying Shrewsbury Prepatoria in Shrewsbury allows parents to take their children out of school whenever it suits themShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  OCT NewsShrewsbury Prepatoria School \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo treasure hunters covered up a find of £million of ancient coins and jewellery so they could pocket the fortune, a court heard today. Metal detectorists George Powell, , and Layton Davies, , allegedly made the discovery while digging in a farmer’s field in April . The haul included up to  coins dating back to Anglo-Saxon and Viking times, gold jewellery and silver ingots, jurors were told. Under UK law they were meant to report the find near Leominster, Herefordshire, to the local coroner as possible treasure. But a court was told they covered up the size of the haul and tried to quietly sell the majority of the coins. Prosecutor Kevin Hegarty QC said the jewellery was so rare it was impossible to put a value on the items.  They included a th century men’s ring, a th century pendant and a th century bracelet in a shape of a serpent. Opening the case on Thursday, Mr Hegarty said: “This case, in two words, is about buried treasure. “Over , years ago, before the Norman Conquest, jewellery, coins and ingots were concealed in the ground. “They stayed there, undisturbed, for many hundreds of years, until June . “On a day in June, George Powell and Layton Davies were out with their metal detectors on farmland. “They were both experienced metal detectors and they found the jewellery, coins and ingots. “They knew when they found this material that this was no ordinary find.  “If they did not know it already, they soon learned it was not simply buried treasure, but a hoard of very valuable coins. “Such a quantity of coins of this kind would attract collectors from all over the world. “They decided to treat the find as theirs and not to declare it to the land owner, the farmer or Crown. In short, they stole it.” Mr Hegarty told Worcester Crown Court that just  coins from the hoard were ever found by police. But he added: “It’s the prosecution’s case that there were many, many more coins were recovered by Powell and Davies. “All we have is a fraction of what had been hidden in the ground , years ago.” Jurors were told experts from the British Museum were drafted in to identy and value the items. The coins included ‘two emperors’, featuring the faces of King Alfred and King Ceolwulf II, worth up to £, each. Other coins known as ‘cross and lozenges’, valued at £, each, were also found in the field, the court heard. Mr Hegarty said the total value of the coins discovered by the duo was “very close to £ million.” He added: “As to the items of jewellery, you may think they are invaluable due to their rarity.” Jurors were told Powell and Davies met an antiques dealer days after finding the haul and showed him  coins. He advised them to declare the find to the coroner after they bragged of discovering “far more”, it is claimed. But they allegedly did nothing until a local finds officer, who had heard about the discovery, emailed Powell.

Author Michael Powell has compiled a smorgasbord of amuse bouches vis-à-vis the English language which is always cromulent and peppered with perslage. Here are just some of his fascinating facts and obscure word definitions...English is the official language of  countries and  non-sovereign nations, and is the second most-spoken language after Mandarin, with over  million users as a first or second language. Avocado comes from a word meaning testicle. When the Aztecs discovered the fruit in BC they probably noted its shape, size, gnarly skin and tendency to grow in pairs. J K Rowling invented the term Muggle to refer to those in the Harry Potter universe who don’t practise magic, but the word has been around for centuries. It first appeared in the th century in an epic poem meaning “a tail resembling that of a fish” In the s, ‘muggle’ became slang for a cannabis joint. The origin of the meaning of the word chaperone as someone who accompanies or supervises another is a metaphor, because a chaperon was a hood formerly worn by nobles. In the late th century, a hundred years before the nursery rhyme, Humpty Dumpty was the name of a drink consisting of boiled ale and brandy. Sideburns were originally called burnsides, named after Union Army General and United States Senator Ambrose Burnside , who was noted for his unusual facial hair.

An enneacontakaienneagon is a shape with  sides. The first written example of chicken meaning ‘coward’ appears in Will Kemp’s Nine Days Wonder in . Semordnilap is a word or phrase that spells a dferent word or phrase backwards , e.g. dog, plug, reviled, desserts, deliver. The longest one-syllable word in the English language is screeched. Queuing is the only word in the English language that contains four consecutive vowels. Tyrosemiophilia is the hobby of collecting cheese labels.

A myriad is literally , of something. The dot over the letter ‘i’ is called a tittle. Bumfiddle means to spoil a piece of paper or document. In the sixteenth century, the word bully was a unisex term of endearment that meant good fellow or darling.

Honoricabilitudinitatibus is the longest word in Shakespeare’s works, and also the longest word in the English language featuring alternating consonants and vowels. It means ‘the state of being able to achieve honours’ and appears in Act V, Scene I of Love’s Labour’s Lost. Sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia is the proper name for an ice-cream headache.

She gave me my love of baking.“Really the cafe is just in honour of their memory.“We looked everywhere for premises, then this came up and we took over in June.“We’ve spent the last three months redecorating and did most of the work ourselves.“It’s an old-fashioned type of tearoom. We sell  dferent types of tea and  dferent types of coffee.”The idea for the shop came to William while he was looking after his dad, who battled cancer until his death last year.He would bake sweet treats for his dad before giving the neighbours any leftovers. It then dawned on him that a cafe would be a fitting tribute to his parents.He added: “I just thought, why not “To actually open a tearoom, and be able to honour them both would just be the fitting thing to do.”William, , is running the tearoom with his nephew, Gary Wallace, .As well as ious homemade cakes and goodies they will sell foods such as paninis, soups and ious other specialities such as stovies.The tearoom will use a special V funnel as part of the coffee-making process. The device means the intensity of the flavour can be adjusted depending on the preference of the customer.He added: “This means the world to me. My mother had a real love for baking and she was a really social person. I know she’s looking down at me.“We are pleased to be open, it’s been three months of hard work for everybody. The Perth Road is a great wee place.”In pride of place on the wall in the tearoom is a photo of his parents on their wedding day.Mary’s Kitchen Tearoom will be open seven days a week from am-.pm."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/12/125246_DCT-863x575.jpg ","title":"lochee swimming pool to draft in leisure and culture dundee staff due to shortage","story":"Leisure and Culture Dundee staff are being drafted in to help keep Lochee Swimming and Leisure Centre open this weekend.The venue was shut suddenly on Monday afternoon when it was revealed there was a lack of management staff to keep it open and deal with any emergency.However, LACD dismissed fears of a staffing crisis and the centre re-opened on Tuesday afternoon.One -year-old customer, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “The whole place was shut when I got there on Monday at about pm.

his chance soon.And he hopes Devlin, pictured, can take his opportunity at international level when it arises.Irvine said: “I’m delighted for Mikey to be in the Scotland squad again.“The Scotland manager sees something in Mikey andhe can get a cap that will be the icing on the cake for him.“The experience of having been in the squad will help his development as a player.“He has been doing well with Aberdeen and he knows he needs to keep that up at club level.“The chances will come as they have with Scott McKenna and when the opportunity is there it’s up to Mikey to take it.“He’s untested at international level, but it may depend on the opposition as to whether he gets a cap.“If he was going in against Belgium that might not be ideal for a first cap.“But with Russia and Sam Marino the next two games they may be good for Mikey to bed into the national team.“Hopefully, he can keep learning and improving.”Irvine is a big fan of Devlin, who joined Aberdeen from Hamilton Accies in January .He admires Devlin’s approach to his defensive work and believes he could do an important job for Scotland.Irvine added: “As a former centre-half I really enjoy watching him play. Whenever I see Aberdeen play I always watch Mikey closely.“I see a lot of positives in the way he plays. Defensively there’s no frills and he gets the job done.“That’s what the job of a defender is – to win tackles, win headers and organise his back four.“On the ball it’s about playing a simple ball up the line or into a midfielder.“The stock skills you need to be a good defender, Mikey has them all in his armoury.“Some defenders are expected to play great passes and to try to play out from the back all the time.“But I’m not so interested in that.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head!

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

and loneliness in the town.The project was officially launched in the summer in the community centre, with almost half of those attending signing up to volunteer.Similar projects exist in other places called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and sports clubs, emphasising community development and outreach.The project is helping tackle social isolation by encouraging GPs and other health professionals to refer those at risk of isolation to ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into contact with one of her lsquocommunity connectorsrsquo related to a certain activity.Community connectors are volunteers from a iety of local groups and clubs, and people who are willing to help out in a iety of the initiativersquos smaller projects.ldquoWe are not pushing them into it, said Carol.ldquoThe connector could give them a realistic sense of what the group is like.Connectors can also volunteer their time to accompany someone, for example, to the gym on a one-off basis.Others can meet someone over a number of occasions, providing them someone to talk to over coffee.Carol has also set up smallscale cafe meetings for those who would like to meet new people.She highlighted it was not only older people who were at risk of social isolation, referring to her own experience of losing her dad and becoming a new mother soon after.She explained how the experience left her ldquocompletely wrecked and thinking that everyone around her was coping very well.She said: ldquoThere are a lot of reasons people might feel isolated at some point.ldquoIf you

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

The council replaced the committee with a new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committee , which has four councillors and two racing experts on it, and agreed to find a third-party operator to take over the racecoursersquos management.Staff at the course were informed of the preferred bidder before a meeting, held in public, of MRAC.It is understood that the appointment of Chester Race Company has been generally welcomed by staff at Musselburgh, who had been concerned a bigger company would come in and not make the course a priority.The company operates its Chester course  days a year, attracting more than , visitors to race days and non-raceday events.Bill Farnsworth, Musselburgh Racecourse general manager, said: ldquoThis is good news: they are very good operators and theirwell-established reputation of providing high-quality racing, for supporting owners and trainers and offering a five-star visitor experience for race-goers, are all values which chime strongly with the team at Musselburgh.ldquoWe are excited about being part of this next chapter in Musselburghrsquos -year-plus history and with Chesterrsquos support we can ensure East Lothian will remain a top destination for the countryrsquos leading racehorse owners and trainers.Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, who chairs MRAC, praised the work of council staff in the procurement process.She said: ldquoThe council, Lothians Racing Syndicate and the staff of the course all agreed a third-party operator was the way forward and I am delighted by this news.Richard Thomas, chief executive of Chester Race Company said: ldquoIt is fantastic to now be able to say we have three racecourses spanning the British Isles.ldquoMusselburgh is a fantastic course at the heart of the East Lothian community and we are committed to ensuring its future is protected. We are excited to get started by working closely with the team and driving a successful handover.The new operators will take over for an initial lease term of  years.Musselburgh Racecourse has  full-time and six permanent part-time staff, though race day numbers swell to more than , including catering staff."},{"url":null,"title":"substation-plan-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-doubt","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltdwas given permission to build the substation on part of the former Cockenzie Power Station site to bring energy from its planned offshore windfarm, off the Angus coast, to the National Grid. But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-embezzlers-sentence-deferred-tries-sell-faside-castle","story":"Ian Brash, , stole more than pound, from the student charity the Dr Robert Malcolm Trust while he was a trustee of the organisation.He pleaded guilty to the offence at a court hearing last year and is awaiting sentencing.The hold-up in the case has been Brashrsquos inability to sell the listed castle on the outskirts of Tranent so he can pay the charity back before sentence is passed.But last Friday, Edinburgh Sherf Court was told that the sale of the castle, currently on the market for offers over pound.m, had still not materialised.Sherf Frank Crowe was also told that the forensic accountant employed by the Crown to go through all Brashrsquos finances had taken ill and would need replaced.Sherf Crowe allowed the Crown motion to further defer sentence to allow them more time to delve into Brashrsquos finances.The case will now call again for sentencing on November .Brash pleaded guilty last year to embezzling pound, from the Dr Robert Malcolm Trust charity between August , , and September , .The father-of-two is currently selling the historic Category A-Listed Farsquoside Castle, a th-century four-storey castle with six bedrooms, four reception rooms and a great hall, through a leading Edinburgh estate agent for offers over pound. million."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Tories minimum wage shift shows politics is moving left","story":"And what better politician to apply the phrase to than Boris Johnson, accused of what has become known as ldquothigh-gate ndash that he placed his hand on a woman journalists leg  years ago. He denies it, of course. But for advocates of the personal is political, his casual conduct is of immense signicance.Similarly, language and the PMs use of military metaphors betray personal traits that are politically signicant. His resort to words like ldquohumbug and ldquoSurrender Act are supposedly windows into the corrupt soul of a misogynistic micro-fascist. I hereby claim , by the way, on the term ldquomicro-fascist, which is an extension of the idea of ldquomicro-aggressions, so popular on university campuses among people who believe tiny things matter a lot.But do they  The media is obsessed with language right now, and personal conduct, possibly because many of its practitioners grew up with the personal is political phrase ringing in their ears. Twitter cant get enough of this stuff, though its no slouch itself when it comes to aggressive language. ldquoRacist, Liar. Misogynist. Mendacious, philandering scumbag! were some of the more temperate reactions on social media to Boris Johnsons recent round of BBC interviews.But judging from the PMs relaxed and unruffled demeanour on Marr and the Today programme, hes not that bothered. His political advisers believe that most people are, rightly or wrongly, supremely indferent to the question of where the PMs hand strayed  years ago. And the preoccupation with language they find almost comical. People use military metaphors all the time, like ldquostick to your guns. Doesnt mean they want to kill you with cannons.Indeed,military metaphors are to be regarded as incitements to violence, then Sir John Curtice had better watch out when he next talks of the general election ldquocampaign being a ldquobattleground with ldquotarget seats, an ldquoair war and a ldquodecapitation strategy. Boris Johnson just makes jokes about all this synthetic outrage. Why  Because the politics of the PMs personal le and language plays well in the echo-chambers of Twitter, but not in focus groups, where people are bothered about pay, jobs, the NHS and Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Im not so sure. Torsten Bell, of the low pay think tank the Resolution Foundation, takes it seriously and hailed it as ldquohugely ambitious. Sajid Javid says he is adopting their policy of a living wage set at % median earnings, to eliminate poverty pay in a decade.Now, they may not mean it. But it seems to me something pretty fundamental is going on undergrowth of British politicsthe Conservatives are even talking this way. The centre-ground has moved dramatically and suddenly to the left.Im not saying the PM has become a Marxist, but its striking that he has started to use the language of Keynesian economics. It is rare enough to hear a Tory advocate higher public spending. But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-apprentice-bake-off-says-middle-classes","story":"Thatrsquos what The Apprentice and Bake-Off are, theyrsquore just reality shows ndash but theyrsquore disguised as something .

But the DNA of both shows is no dferent to Big Brother or Love Island: real people are on screen for our entertainment.

You learn zilch about le and the people living ityou watch these shows.But this isnrsquot a diatribe against reality TV. I have come to praise the genre, not bury it. Irsquove long championed reality TV. I just donrsquot rate The Apprentice or Bake-Off as great representatives of the genre. The best reality TV gives viewers a glimpse of whatrsquos shting about in the tectonic plates of our world, how humans feel right here and right now, how society is changing, how peoplersquos lives and attitudes are being shaped.Reality TV is the very heart of popular, mainstream entertainment. I donrsquot think you can fully get to grips with the world unless you embrace reality TV and use it to navigate not just pop culture, but wider culture. If you think Irsquom mad, let me call TS Eliot in defence. Eliot, probably the th centuryrsquos greatest poet, was a huge admirer of the Music Hall ndash which was seen, a century ago, as the home of trash entertainment. Culturally, Music Hall was the Edwardian equivalent of reality TV. Eliot, though, believed Music Hall ndash with its iety acts, smut and sentimentality ndash was the truest representation of the society within which he lived. He felt that the Music Hall singer and comedian Marie Lloyd ldquorepresented and expressed something signicant about the spirit of the nation. Roll forward  years and Eliot could have been speaking about Big Brotherrsquos Jade Goody.George Orwell was also a fan of Music Hall. Many like him saw it as having a ldquoredeeming socialas it held a mirror directly up to ordinary le.Big Brother had more social signicance in a single episode than every series of The Apprentice and the Bake-Off put together. From the get-go it showed society changing when it came to sexuality and gender. It revealed chasms of racism in Britain, which were not being discussed. It showed up our culturersquos cruelty, pettiness, narcissism, stupidity and greed. Yes, of course, it was manipulative, gaudy, and loud ndash but so was the Music Hall. You have to accept the bits you donrsquot like to get to the juice within.I find it an endless source of irony that the people who binge-eat The Apprentice and the Bake-Off sneer like Jacob Rees-Mogg confronted with a Greggs sausage roll when mention is made of shows like Big Brother.For the best of Reality TV, donrsquot bother watching The Apprentice tonight. Watch The Circle on Channel . Itrsquos as noisy and day-glo as Big Brother, but itrsquos also the most compelling dissection of the effects of social media on human beings that Irsquove ever seen.The show sees a group of strangers placed in isolation and only able to communicate via social media. On social media, they can be whoever they want to be. The last series was won by a man pretending to be a woman. Contestants are allowed to post fake pictures of themselves, or lie and manipulate. This series sees one man pretending to be a single mother, and a middle aged woman posing as a laddish bricklayer.As in the online world, people immediately place all emphasis on appearance ndash the selfie rules ndash but no-one knows whatrsquos fake, whatrsquos true. Contestants are addicted to clicks and likes. They lose touch with the real world and real human beings. They become needy, nervous, depressed, obsessed. They fall foul of group-think. They fear rejection ndash they crave the love of the online world they inhabit.On The Circle the mere act of posting a good or bad picture can change how everyone thinks of you. Itrsquos about curating your le so others see only your best side, not the real you. People share personal information in a way theyrsquod never do in real le. Acts of kindness are phoney and virtue-signalled. Everything comes with a hashtag and an emoji. Everything is manipulated. And when reality finally breaks in and the contestants meet each other in real le theyrsquore nothing like their digital selves. We see the real them ndash honest, shy, decent hellip normal.This is reality TV which explores the new reality in which we live: a phoney, empty, dumbed-down world thatrsquos a bit like an episode of The Apprentice or Bake-Off.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-beefs-international-border-policy-braces-no-deal-brexit","story":"Iain Livingstone is desperate to maintain crime-fighting links with the rest of the continent after the UK leaves the European Union, perhaps as early as the end of this month.Senior officers and politicians have long warned about the dangers of losing access to Europol, the EU centre co-ordinating investigations and intelligence.Now Mr Livingstone, writing in The Herald, has revealed he has been forced to bolster existing teams monitoring sea and airports and liaising across borders.

But the findings fired up the Twittersphere as the meat promoters claimed vindication and pro-Atkins gurus said this was yet more proof that all our problems are down to sugar and carbs anyway.Meanwhile, plant-based advocate Walter Willett, a US professor of epidemiology and nutrition, dubbed the research an \"egregious abuse of evidence\", and the World Cancer Research Fund said it would not alter its recommendations to limit red meat intake.Professor Giles Yeo, a Cambridge University geneticist and obesity researcher, noted that the risk perception changed whether you looked at the findings on an inidual or population level.For example, the study suggests that, people cut out three portions of red or processed meat every week for their letime, there would be seven fewer deaths from cancer, of any type.Most people might take their chances and consider that the likelihood of them being one of those lucky seven are pretty small.At a population level, however, that is  fewer cases of cancer for every million people. As Prof Yeo pointed out, thats not exactly trivial.: Public inquiries can give answers - but not always the answers people wantFurthermore, a major study in January said the only sustainable diet for the planet would be plant-based, and humanity would have to halve its red meat and sugar intake by .But does this give people a right to moralise about meat Maybe yes, but it the problem is it is counter-productive: brow-beating and lecturing will only entrench habits, not change them.A more plant-based diet is almost certainly the direction of travel.

You know, scrapping our easy ability to move for love, reunite families, make better lives, reap all the many benefits of travel.Never mind, eh  Its worth the sacrice to ensure we take back control of Britains borders.Ms Patel will end freedom of movement \"for once and for all\", she told the Conservative party conference in Manchester with no little smugness, adding that instead of free movement the government would introduce an Australian-style points based immigration system.She was serene in her hypocrisy, speaking also of the Conservatives as a party of law and order just days after the prime ministers prorogation of parliament was ruled unlawful. She praised an immigration system that, it has been suggested, would have prevented her own family from migrating to Britain.But then, a points-based system would mean no Ms Patel as Home Secretary. Perhaps theres something in it after all.Tough on immigration, tough on the causes of immigration. Because, lets face it, immigrants come to Britain seeking a better le and our post-Brexit future offers only grim uncertainty. Cunning.Let us also glide over the fact Labour set up an Australian-style points-based immigration system, which was then scrapped in  because the people it admitted were not finding skilled work.And isnt that the whole point  That instead of the spectre of hyper-fertile brown people who abuse the benefits system to live in eight-bedroomed mansions, we only let in Mensa-accredited grafters who eat PhDs for breakfast and will single-handedly boost GDP to record levels. Cant do thatyoure unemployed.It was faintly amusing,you like your amusement with a side order of alarm, that Ms Patels announcement that Britain will make its borders more hostile came as Saudi Arabia announced plans to make the country more welcoming to foreigners with the introduction of tourist visas.At the anniversary of the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government staff, when homosexuality is still punishable by death and when women suffer under severe restrictions of their rights, appearing less welcoming to outsiders than Saudi Arabia is certainly a look. Not a good one.Tourists looking to take the Kingdom up on its offer will have to balance shining a light on injustices thriving under isolation with giving money to a government that will use it for nefarious purposes.Back to Ms Patel who, at least, is consistent, having first called for an Australian-style points based system three years ago. Her pledge now to press on with such a system - and we dont know how it will look as we are several months away from a Migration Advisory Committee review of how the system would work - stands in contrast to last Decembers more liberal white paper on immigration from Sajid Javid.Promising an Australian-style system indicates new government plans will be harsher than those announced under a year ago.\"Australian-style\" seems to have become synonymous with \"hard-line\" for politicians looking to appease voters on the topic of immigration. Donald Trump, as another example, also pledged an Australian-style points based system to his electorate to tighten up Americas borders.People have the impression of the Australian system as being tough. This has perhaps become increasingly the case because of its stance on asylum seekers - the horric conditions imposed on refugees in the now closed Nauru and Manus Island offshore processing camps, part of the defunct Pacic Solution.The notion aping Australia will clamp down on migration is an interesting take given that the Australian system was designed to increase levels of immigration to the country. Scaled up, it would have the effect of allowing in far more new residents to the UK than our current systems.So, what Ms Patel is pledging is to end freedom of movement yet introduce an immigration system that invites a high level of migrants to the country. The dference being, of course, that it will allow in the \"right sort\" of migrants, the \"best and brightest\".Out of interest, I totted up my points and wouldnt have enough to be welcome in Australia. Bit of a bummer to reduce your social and economic worth to hard figures and find out one is not the best or brightest.One of the criticisms of the Australian system is that it is too white. A focus on English proficiency prioritises those from countries where English is a first language, unlike the Canadian system which is also points based but encourages multi-culturalism.Another of the oft-discussed elements of the Australian system is that it allows people to migrate without first having work, an element that has its pluses - people are not tied to one employer, say, and can move jobs more easily - but also its downsides, in that new residents do not always find employment.Australia is now increasingly moving away from this system, allowing employers to offer visas to skilled migrants as well as using its points system.Reducing immigration and ending free movement will harm the UK economy and our society, particularly the NHS and universities. Weve heard enough about the benefits migrants bring to the country to know this. Yet there seems a real lack of meaningful discussion about migration, only hard-line promises to drastically reduce immigration or complaints that politicians have broken their promises.It seems to be overlooked that while people come in, people also go out. Ending free movement is an act of self-harm based on unfounded suspicion of migrants stoked by an aggressively isive political class. There is no concrete evidence that a points-based system - which has been discussed for years across political parties - will be the right step for Britain.Instead, the phrase has become a posturing shorthand for a politician pretending to crack the whip on immigration. It is an empty pledge, its only meaning to reassure those made insecure and fearful by immigration that Britain will be callous to outsiders.Priti Patels narrative is a dog-whistle, blaming immigrants for Britains problems in lieu of accepting how much damage is of her own partys making."},{"url":null,"title":"dust-forms-stars-recreated-university-lab","story":"Professor Martin McCoustra and a team of scientists from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh have spent the last  years investigating how ice forms and behaves around tiny specks in the interstellar environment.From that, new stars and planets are formed, as well as structures like the Eagle Nebula, providing a source of complex organic molecules from which le can originate.The astrochemists recreated deep space in their lab and found the dust to be much more structurally complex than first thought.Prof McCoustra compared it to a ldquobadly-baked cherry cake instead of the widely-held belief that the dust is structured like an onion.: Scots scientists unearth secrets of the Earthrsquos crust on GreenlandHe said: ldquoThese tiny little snowballs have key roles to play in the evolution of the current universe, from controlling the process of star formation to providing an inventory of organic molecules from which biology might evolve.ldquoIf we understand their formation and evolution then we can more fully appreciate those roles.ldquoThe onion model visualises the icy coat of the grains as a series of layers, where the core dust grain is first fully covered by a thick layer of water-rich ice.ldquoOn top of that layer, other species are adsorbed depending on temperature.

For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels. They are then being asked to report where and when they saw them on the Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels websitescottishsquirrels.org.uk.Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels is a partnership project led by the Scottish Wildle Trust that is working to protect red squirrels where they are most under threat from the spread of non-native grey squirrels. Squirrel sightings received from the public help the project understand how red and grey squirrel populations are changing over time and decide where to focus conservation efforts.Prject manager Dr Mel Tonkin said: “We monitor squirrel populations throughout the year, and in  we received an incredible  squirrel sightings from members of the public.“This year, thanks to support from National Lottery players, we’re trying something a bit dferent.“By going out and looking for squirrels during the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey people can help us create a more detailed snapshot of the current situation on the ground.”Autumn is an ideal time of year for squirrel-watching. With leaves falling they can be easier to spot as they move through the treetops, foraging for the autumn harvest of seeds, nuts and berries. They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On top of that layer, other species are adsorbed depending on temperature. “This means only a relatively pure layer of water interacts directly with the dust grain surface while other species, such as carbon monoxide, will interact with the water surface.“We discovered that water is more mobile on the dust grain surface and tends to form little islands of ice as opposed to a unorm film. This leaves parts of the grain surface free on which other species can adsorb.“So instead of an onion, picture a badly-baked cherry cake, where the cherries of water have sunk to the bottom of the icy cake as it is baked.”A space dust proxy - copper plate coated in tiny silica particles, cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero and in an ultrahigh vacuum - was used for the experiments on ious species found in the environment.Prof McCoustra added: “We are refining our model of how space dust grows and have, through a combination of observation and computer simulation, developed a yet-to-be-proven hypothesis.”The paper - Surface Science Investigations of Icy Mantle Growth on Interstellar Dust Grains in Cooling Environments - can be read in full online. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"census should count trans people as who they really are vic valentine","story":"Biology is important but that does not mean trans people#s identities have to be undermined, writes Vic Valentine.Many people in Scotland have probably never met a trans person. Or at least you may not know you have – we are a erse community with plenty of people who fade into the background as well as those who stand out in a crowd. As public conversations around trans equality get louder, lots of people looking in have no sense of what this all means for a family member, a neighbour, or a friend. It can all feel very hypothetical. But the problem for trans people is that our lives are very much real, and the outcome of these conversations have a big impact.Take the Census for example. Next time around, the Census will ask, as it always has,you are male or female. Trans men and trans women, as they always have, want to answer this question with how they live their lives and identy. But a number of campaigning organisations and MSPs have called for this to change. Instead, they say that trans people should be forced to answer with the sex that’s on our birth certicates. From the outside, this might not seem like such a big deal. But actually, it really matters.: Hostility towards trans people at Pride march was shocking – Christine Jardine: Trans-gender politics puts very basis of feminism at risk – Susan DalgetyMost trans people still have birth certicates with the sex they were recorded at birth. So this change would mean that trans people would be required by law to declare ourselves as something that we know we aren’t. To be forced to tick a box that would show a total disregard for the too frequent sacrices and struggles many of us have faced in order to be happy and comfortable living our lives as who we truly are. Making this change would send a clear message. It would tell us that people don’t see our lives and identities as real. That they don’t believe we are who we say we are.And the Census is just the start. There are growing calls to require people to declare their sex recorded at birth in all circumstances – such as when applying for jobs, accessing services and completing government questionnaires. Often, these calls are justied by saying that biology is important, and we must record it.The importance of biologyWe absolutely agree that biology is important. But we don’t think that forcing trans people to be counted in a way that undermines our identity and dignity is necessary to recognise this.For most people who aren’t trans , you can make a good guess about what their body is like based on whether they tick male or female. Because of this, it’s possible to use information about the numbers of men and women for broad planning around healthcare and other service provision.But for trans people it’s more complicated. Manyof us access gender reassignment treatments that mean our bodies are far from typical for the sex we were recorded at birth. Requiring us to identy our sex recorded at birth doesn’t give you the same kind of physical information that it does for the overwhelming majority who are not trans. But it does say to us that the way we live our lives doesn’t matter, only the bodies we were born with.The conversations going on around the Census, and the establishment of a Scottish Government working group on sex, gender, and data, are real opportunities to think through these issues carefully. We want people to be able to take part in these conversations, to ask questions, and hopefully to understand where we’re coming from, and why we think we deserve to be counted as who we really are.Vic Valentine is policy officer at the Scottish Trans Alliance©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen sought advice on sacking prime minister source claims","story":"The monarch reportedly asked aides for first time in her reign just how and when should could dismiss a PM.The Queen sought advice on the circumstances in which she could sack a prime minister ahead of Tuesday’s incendiary Supreme Court ruling, i has been told.A source claims that the monarch asked her aides for the first time for clarication on just when and how she could dismiss a prime minister who refuses to step aside.The alleged consultations reinforce suggestions that the monarch and her most senior aides had deep concerns about Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament, even before the country’s most senior court was asked to declare the move unlawful.It was reported on Sunday that Mr Johnson phoned the Queen to personally apologise for the embarrassment caused by the crushing Supreme Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully when he advised the monarch to suspend Parliament for five weeks - advice which she was obliged to accept.: Johnson refuses to confirm he apologised to the Queen​ Constitutional crisisi has now been told that the Queen personally asked for advice on the constitutional circumstances in which she can effectively sack a prime minister.Under the rules of the British constitution the Queen can only \"advise, encourage and warn\" ministers. It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland becomes first part of uk to ban smacking of children","story":"The Scottish Government last night pledged to lead a public awareness campaign along with police and social work chiefs.Read more: Last-ditch bid to halt Scotland smacking ban as MSPs prepare to pass lawMorag Driscoll, the Law Society of ScotlandrsquosFamily Law Committee convener, said the legislation brings Scotland in line with commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.Read more: Smacking ban lsquosends clear message physical punishment isnrsquot acceptablersquoBut she said: ldquoDriving meaningful behavioural change requires much more than changing the law. ldquoNow is the time to move on from the idea that violence against children can be justied.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport waiving fees for us military aircraft","story":"The state-owned Glasgow Prestwick Airport is waiving service fees for inbound US military aircraft as part of an alleged practice designed to increase traffic at the beleaguered airport and safeguard its lucrative commercial relationship with the US Defence Department, multiple sources familiar with its operations have told The Scotsman. The heavily-indebted airport, which is at the centre of a US Congressional investigation over the US military’s financial ties with Prestwick and President Donald Trump’s nearby Trump Turnberry resort, is alleged to have waived the so-called service fees for several hundred flights by branches of the US Armed Forces.Sources with direct knowledge of US military business at Prestwick said the cost to the airport and, as a result, Scottish taxpayers, runs into seven figures. “Scottish taxpayers are picking up the tab for the largest and wealthiest military force on the planet,” one explained.The airport, a publicly-owned asset which is operated on a fully commercial basis, has repeatedly declined to answer a series of questions put to it by The Scotsman regardingthe allegations it is waiving the service fees. The US Embassy in London also declined to confirm whether it was aware of the allegations.But Patrick Harvie MSP, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, called on the airport’s relationship with the US military to be “suspended at once.”He said: “In light of these staggering allegations that the Scottish Government owned airport is giving freebies to the US military, ministers must urgently explain how on earth they have allowed this to happen.”The hub was putup for sale by the Scottish Government in June. A new buyer is expected to be announced shortly. It is running at an annual loss of £.m and is reliant on £.m in loans from Scottish ministers. The US Armed Forces budget stands at £bn. Congressional investigation The South Ayrshire airport does not publicly disclose the exact cost of the service fees it ordinarily charges, but several sources indicated the charges in question would reach around £, for larger aircraft such as Boeing C- Globemaster III military transports, with the fee falling to around £ for smaller aircraft such as C- Gulfstream jets. The allegations facing the airport will likely draw increased scrutiny from both sides of the Atlantic at a time when the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee in the US Congress is investigating US military payments at both Prestwick and Trump Turnberry amid concerns of “serious conflicts of interest” and potential violations of the foreign emoluments clause of the US constitution.Sources with knowledge of Prestwick’s in-house fixed base operationsbusiness said the alleged waiving of the service fees has been taking place since around  to  with the full knowledge of senior management. One senior source familiar with the airport’s military business said that the decision to waive the fees was made to ensure the troubled hub was seen as competitive in the eyes of the US military, and protect a lucrative multimillion pound refuelling deal with a US Defence Department agency. As revealed by The Scotsman in June, the Defence Logistics Agency , a Virginia-based body which manages the global supply chain for the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, has paid Prestwick nearly £m to refuel aircraft since October . The House committee launched its investigation in June, writing to Pentagon to demand the release of spending records and communications between the US Defence Department and Prestwick and Turnberry. The Defence Department has in turn referred the request for its communications with Prestwick to the White House. In recent weeks, The Scotsman has also revealed how Trump Turnberry was the only hotel named in literature distributed by Prestwick at closed door meetings with US military, despite the fact it is one of  hotels used to accommodate aircrews. The airport’s website was subsequently edited to remove several mentions of Mr Trump’s property, including in a section dedicated to military customers. Taxpayers ‘picking up the tab’ for US militaryOne source familiar with Prestwick’s military business explained: “I would suggest what’s happening is the Scottish taxpayers are picking up the tab for the largest and wealthiest military force on the planet. The US military crews pick up the fuel as part of the DLA contract, and that’s it. “It’s unnecessary. The US military budget is colossal and they don’t care what they spend. It’s just done to try and encourage as much traffic as possible to Prestwick.”Another source with knowledge of Prestwick’s operations confirmed: “The only charges the US military get are fuel costs. Everything  is waived. That’s on the basis the DLA contract is fairly lucrative and those fees should be waived.”The Scotsman can also reveal a series of other fees chargeable to US military aircraft are being picked up by UK taxpayers via the Ministry of Defenceas part of a longstanding reciprocal deal with the US Defence Department. While this specic arrangement - confirmed by the MoD - is little known, even within defence circles, there is no suggestion it is improper or flouts any laws. : US military fuel deal with Prestwick ‘kicked into long grass’ over Trump investigationIt is unclear exactly how many inbound US military flights have stopped at Prestwick in the past three years, but figures compiled by the US Air Forceafter it emerged the Congressional investigation was underway show its aircraft made  stopovers since the start of  through to August this year. The frequency of those stopovers have increased markedly over the period, rising from  in  to  in  and  in . There were  stopovers in the first eight months of this year. Last month, The Scotsman revealed how in August, a new, even more lucrative deal struck by the DLA with Prestwick to provide it with approximately . million gallons of aviation fuel through to the end of September  had been postponed.Costs run into seven figuresA source familiar with the deal said it had been “kicked into the long grass” as a result of the Congressional scrutiny. The DLA said the decision was unrelated to the committee’s inquiry. The alleged waiving of the service fees by Prestwick covers a range of goods and services that are routinely charged by the airport and provided by its FBO team. They include providing marshals, placing and removing chocks and crew steps, and transporting crews and freight. The exact amount that has been picked up by the MoD for the other fees is unclear, although those familiar with the costings claim the bill for the USAF flights that have stopped off at Prestwick in recent years alone would also run into seven figures. That arrangement sees the MoD picking up the cost of so-called landing, navigation and parking fees, and forms part of a reciprocal deal struck with its counterpart in Washington DC which sees authorities in the US pick up the bill for landing, navigation and parking fees whenever UK military aircraft use US airports. However, the economic parity of the arrangement is unclear, and depends largely on the amount of military traffic, and the types of aircraft. The Scotsman has also obtained information prepared by senior management at the airport as it attempts to stem losses before being ed to private ownership. It includes details of discussions to sell off property to a range of interested parties, including the MoD and the housebuilding firm, Persimmon Homes.Prestwick executives have also held talks with Sierra Nevada Corporation, the US firm behind the Dream Chaser space plane, as part of the airport’s ambitions to host a spaceport. A spokesman for the MoD confirmed it was picking up ious fees for US military aircraft at Prestwick.‘Reciprocal arrangement’ He said: “The UK does not pay handling fees for US military aircraft however, under a reciprocal arrangement, the MoD pays landing, parking and navigation fees for US military aircraft and likewise the US Department of Defence pays such fees for UK military aircraft in the US.”Asked about the alleged service fee waivers, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said airport charges in the UK were discretionary, and that inidual airports could apply “whatever charges they think appropriate to their ious customers” through commercial arrangements. He added that with the exception of Heathrow, airport charges are not subject to regulation.Glasgow Prestwick Airport declined to answer a series of questions put to it by The Scotsman about the alleged service fee waivers, including how it provides value for money to taxpayers, and whether any similar arrangement is in place with other military or commercial customers. Askedit or the Scottish Government was aware, or had any oversight over, or input into, the alleged waiving of service fees at Prestwick, a spokeswoman for the executive agency, Transport Scotland, said: “Glasgow Prestwick Airport is operated on a commercial basis and at arm’sfrom the Scottish Government, in compliance with European Union state aid rules. Ministers do not intervene in the commercial discussions at the airport.“The senior management team at the airport has been tasked with all aspects of taking the airport forward, including building on existing revenue streams. Glasgow Prestwick Airport has handled military and private flights since the s and it remains an important part of the airport’s business.” The USAF referred The Scotsman’s enquiry about the alleged service fee waivers to the US Office of the Secretary of Defence, who referred it to the US Department of Transportation. It was subsequently passed to the US State Department and the US Embassy in London.A spokeswoman for the embassy did not directly address the question of whether it was aware of the allegations that Prestwick was waiving the fees. She said: “The United States has reciprocal understandings with many nations, including the United Kingdom, whereby airports waive landing and parking fees for government aircraft.”: Trump Turnberry resort singled out in airport’s pitch to US military©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"residents rail against plans to allow sydney harbour bridge style walks on forth bridge","story":"Dozens of residents have objected to plans to allow , people a year to climb the Forth Bridge.People living near the -year-old railway bridge in South Queensferry fear the visitor influx will swamp the town.They claim the plans for Sydney Harbour Bridge-style climbs will cause parking problems and disturbance. Network Rail said there was a “real appetite” for what it described as a “unique and memorable visit to one of Scotland’s most loved structures”.However,  people have lodged objections to a planning application for the scheme, against  posting their support, some from where in Scotland.Their concern centres on a planned “bridge walk hub” between Dalmeny station and the bridge, where visitors would be kitted out and briefed for the £- walks.Residents Louise Beattie and Helen Howden said concerns included increased traffic and the volume of cars that may park on the town’s streets. Fellow opponent Jeana Gorman said: “We are not naive enough to think it’s not going to go ahead, but we are trying to limit the effect it will have on the area.”She said around  trees would be felled, which meant people using a new elevated walkway from the station to the centre would be able to see into houses and gardens.She said the centre should instead be at the Queensferry Crossing contact and education centre beside the Forth Road Bridge, with visitors transferred by electric buses.Fellow resident Graeme Pearson said: “The car park at Dalmeny station is always overflowing so cars park along the street, creating serious safety issues crossing the road and for emergency vehicles.”Network Rail said the centre’s car park would be for pre-booked, time-limited parking.Its spokesperson said: “The Forth Bridge Experience has the potential to provide a major economic boost to South Queensferry as well as opening up this iconic structure to visitors from across the world.“We understand these proposals will raise questions for some residents and are committed to working closely with the council and the local community to deliver this project as sensitively as possible.”Network Rail said its transport assessments showed there would be sufficient car parking spaces for visitors to the centre.It said the car park would have a barrier to ensure it was properly used.The bridge owner said all visitors would be issued with a pre-booked time-slot when buying tickets, “so visitor numbers would be spread evenly across the day”.It said that would reduce potential overuse of the car park and walking routes. Visitors would be encouraged to travel by public transport, such as by train to Dalmeny.The public footpath network between the station and the bridge would be improved, with the existing path being “removed and planted, creating a wider green corridor between residents and the new footpath”.Network Rail said the new public path would be constructed further away from properties than the existing one “and additional planting would be undertaken in the intervening gap.“Mature trees will be maintained as much as possible around the site of the new hub building to provide natural screening.“The proposed hub building is approximately m from the closest residential property and there will be substantial woodland planting in the intervening gap.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

I’m delighted with it – I’d kick a ball all day longI could!I’m glad that it hasn’t been impacted and I was able to play in the league and be a part of the team for the Championship.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"jobs saved at harland and wolff as bid for shipyard accepted","story":"A financial bid for Harland and Wolff shipyard has been accepted following a nine-week occupation by its staff.The site has been bought for a total of £ million by InfraStrata, a London-based energy firm. The yard went into administration in August following the collapse of its Norwegian parent company.InfraStrata said it will retain the  workers who are still employed.Trade union Unite says it expects people toto work as early as this week. Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries. They deserve immense credit for their work over the last number of months,” he said.“What’s needed now is an economic strategy for the shipyard that will allow the site to grow and prosper. We have a real opportunity to create a green energy hub on the site, forging ahead with the assembly and manufacture of cutting edge wind technology. That’s where the economy of the future is and we should be preparing for it now.“I want to pay tribute to the immense strength and resilience of the shipyard workers and their trade union representatives who made this a pressing political priority.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lamh dhearg and portglenone get ready for part three","story":"BOTH Lámh Dhearg and Portglenone will be hoping it’s third time lucky in Ballymena this eveningas they meet once again to see who will advance into Sunday’s Antrim Senior Football Championship final.Thursday’s replay at Queen’s Arena was another night of high drama as Conall Delargy kicked an equaliser deep into stoppage time to force extra-time and Casement’s thought they had got it done as they led by one in the dying seconds of the additional period, only for Ben Rice to storm through and kick another equaliser with the last act of the game and force a free-kick contest.After five kicks each, the teams were level at - so it went to sudden death with the five kickers going again and all converted, prompting Antrim chairman Ciaran McCavana to step in and offer the teams the opportunity of another game to decide it in a more orthodox manner.His decision mostly drew praise from throughout the county and it was also applauded by Lámh Dhearg manager, Mairtín Lynch, who felt McCavana did the right thing.“I thought it was terribly brave of the county board a to advocate this and they should be given great praise for what they did,” he said.“Both teams need massive respect because they#ve brought tremendous goodwill to Antrim football. Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

to avoid a hard border, but its preferred solution is the backstop, the Taoiseach has said..pushMr Varadkar said the UK reversing the Brexit decision, or deciding to stay in the single market and customs union, were other potential ways to resolve the border issue.He said a fth theoretical solution, Ireland re-joining the UK, was never going to happen.“There are one in five ways that this can be done, and at least four of those would be acceptable to the Irish Government, but the best one is of course a backstop or some form of backstop, and that’s what we are trying to achieve,” the Taoiseach said on a visit to Sweden.On the prospect of a united Ireland, Mr Varadkar said: “There probably isn’t a majority for that at the moment, although some opinion polls would suggest there is.”Commenting on the likelihood of the UK staying in the EU, the Taoiseach added: “All the polls since Prime Minister Johnson became prime minister suggest that’s what the British people actually want, but their political system isn’t able to give them that choice.”Later, Ireland’s deputy premier said the island of Ireland was not ready for a poll on unication.Simon Coveney warned that such a debate would create more isions at a time when the focus should be on the post-Brexit arrangements.Mr Coveney, addressing the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee in Dublin, said it was not the time for a border poll.“But all of the isions that flow from that, and the calls for more radical change and so on in Northern Ireland, which I don’t believe we’re ready for,” he said. ”“So these are dficult times where we’re writing history at the moment for what the relationship between Britain and Ireland and the EU and the UK will look like for the next  years and we need to get it right.”He added: “Ultimately, we’ve got to make sure that we aren’t going back to a border on the island of Ireland being a political debating point again, and all that flows from that in terms of the corrosive impact on relationships and the disruption to trade, which has been such a reinforcer of normality and peace in the border region for the last two decades.“We want to work with the British Prime Minister and we’re working as part of Michel Barnier’s team.“We will do everything we can to try to get a deal In the next week or so.“But it’s got to be the right deal so that we don’t let people down and find that the border becomes the topic of debate in Ireland for the foreseeable future.”Mr Coveney added: “If we’re going to replace the backstop with something , it has to do the same job, which is to reassure border communities that they’re not going to face border infrastructure and the disruption in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup leader criticises dublins rejection of uks

We will not buy that.”Ms Foster added: “The Irish Government’s preparedness to dump the consent principle for their country’s expediency is foolish in the extreme and sends a very clear message to unionists.“From our  manesto to paragraph  of the December  Joint Report, the consent of the people of Northern Ireland for specic solutions has been key.“It is at the heart of the Belfast and St Andrews Agreements, yet the Irish foreign minister is now railing against it because it doesn’t suit his agenda.“There will be noto the flawed backstop.

I didn’t walk for two years. I forgot what it is to stand, I forgot I was taller than a lot of people in the room,” he said after successfully using the exoskeleton.A previous patient recruited to the study had to be excluded because a technical problem prevented the brain implants communicating with the algorithm. The implants were removed.Professor Alim-Louis Benabid of the University of Grenoble, said the exoskeleton used is the first semi-invasive wireless brain-computer system designed for long term use to activate all four limbs.“Previous brain-computer studies have used more invasive recording devices implanted beneath the outermost membrane of the brain, where they eventually stop working,” he told medical journal The Lancet.“They have also been connected to wires, limited to creating movement in just one limb, or have focused on restoring movement to patients’ own muscles.”Prof Tom Shakespeare, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the exoskeleton is a long way from being a usable clinical possibility.“A danger of hype always exists in this field.“Evenever workable, cost constraints mean that hi-tech options are never going to be available to most people in the world with spinal cord injury,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say october","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference.

It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Coleman and Gerard Hughes exchanged scores in the aftermath of McManusrsquo red card before Nicholson gave Ballycran a - to - lead after  minutes. Two OrsquoPrey frees levelled matters in the st minute, but the drama was still unfolding.A Martin goal in the st minute put Ballycran into a - to - lead and a point from Phelim Savage increased the lead to four points just before the break.To make matters even worse for Portaferry, they had OrsquoPrey sent off after picking up a second yellow card.Ballycran now had the bit between their teeth and scores after the break from Scott Nicholsonand Phelim and Liam Savage had the McKenna Park side almost out of sight.Martin and Woods increased Ballycranrsquos lead to nine points before Portaferry hit back with scores from Colemanand Conor Mageean to leave the score at - to - with  minutes remaining.Another Coleman point left five in it, but Ballycran simply pulled away and claimed the SHC title for the th time.Ballycranrsquos Mick Branf, who managed the side with Gary Savage, was more than pleased with the way his charges went about the job.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable. This team has never put back-to-back championships and then all you have from everyone is that they are one-hit wonders, theyrsquoll get a championship this year, but sure next year itrsquoll not happen, he said.ldquoThey havenrsquot the heart for it, but they showed the heart they have.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station.

After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9411974.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If the EU wants to insist on border check points on the island of Ireland that is a matter for them. There will be no internal UK border in the Irish Sea.”For the DUP to maintain that these new proposals are compatible with their previousstatements is to take the wider unionist community for fools. The facts are very clear. Northern Ireland would stay in the single market for goods, in an all-island regulatory zone. There would be additional checks for goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which is clearly a breach of the UK’s internal single market.I have no idea what threats have been made or promises offered to persuade the DUP to accept these proposals, but I am very clear that they represent a complete abandonment of the DUP’s previous position that there should be no border in the Irish Sea. I am shocked that anybody describing themselves as a unionist would be not simply accepting but advocating a border up the Irish Sea. I do not know how any unionist can possibly stand in front of the electorate and say that. It is an outrage, and people need to think very carefully where we are going with all of this.If the NI assembly will have a role in whether or not to accept EU regulations, it will certainly not be a veto — there may be some form of consultation. But, lest some will claim that there will be an effective unionist veto over accepting EU regulations for a limited time period, may I point out thata decision of the assembly is needed to agree to that, then Sinn Fein and other nationalists will have a veto over whether or not we can get out of that regulatory regime when any time period would be agreed with Brussels. Is this what the DUP’s Brexit campaign was all about  I do not think they ever saw Northern Ireland being in such a constitutional mess.

There is a sinister reason why. To turn everyone and anyone against the DUP. Asit was their fault the talks collapsed. Protestants in Northern Ireland are being demonised by republicans Sinn Fein IRA and those who are anti Protestant and anti British.

Of recent times police officers have been targeted in ious areas namely east Belfast at Shandon Park golf club and parts of north and west Belfast, even a primary school. Plus that poor girl Lyra McKee was shot dead in Londonderry, no one arrested for this.Also, Sinn Fein are doing their best to erase my Britishness away. They moan about flags, our culture and marching. They now want to stop us flying flags on lamp posts, they do no harm ... unlike guns and bombs. SF IRA took away my right as a British citizen to fly the British Union flag over Belfast City Hall. Yet you want me as a DUP voter to accept the Irish language. There is no way this should even be considered. Until they respect me as a Protestant British etc I will never accept them for who the are. Terrorists and bigots will do anything to bring my country to its knees. I would therefore suggest you think of people like me and those who have suffered under the SF IRA campaign.I hope you have time to search you’re concsience and think again what’s happening.

But it does work, because the spirits used the light to communicate.”Stephen said: “I asked the spirit ‘are you a man ’, it didn’t light up. Then I asked ‘are you a woman ’ and it lit up.“It wasn’t the only spirit there were another two gentlemen there. But there was nothing to fear, there was no threatening energy there. I think they were quite happy to communicate and watch what I was doing.”Legend has it that a recluse, Julia McQuillen, known as the ‘Black Nun,’ is buried at the site, but Stephen said he doesn’t knowit was her who was communicating with him. When he ed to London two days later there was a big storm.He said: “I recorded it on my phone and when I played it back I heard voices ... I can hear this woman saying ‘what’s he aiming at ’... and then another voice came through and said ‘hello’, a woman’s voice. At the very end two or three monks are singing in Latin.”Last week, back in Co Antrim, he revisited the friary with his paranormal investigation equipment.

But when I played it back, you can hear her whisper ‘No’.’’ He said this confirms that the monks had attached themselves to him, went all the way to London and “then I released them”. Stephen, who admitted his work sometimes gives him “the creeps”, said he knows many might not take his claims seriously, but added: “I get messages from the other side ... you just have to listen to the recordings.”• Listen to the recordings of the monks chanting at www.newsletter try catch  TrendingIts official -

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.
