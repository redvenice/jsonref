She said that “racism is a factor” in the criticism the duchess has faced since marrying Prince Harry.“I think it’s more deeply embedded in people’s consciousness than any of us are willing to admit,” said Mantel. “So I hesitate to call her a victim but I think there has been an element of racism in the invective against her.”Harry and Meghan will stop representing the Queen and become financially independent on 31 March. The decision followed what the prince described as a campaign of bullying by the British tabloid press against his wife, “a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son”.Mantel, whose novel Bring Up the Bodies depicted the downfall of Anne Boleyn, as engineered by Cromwell, said there was “still an intense concentration on the bodies of royal women”.“We only have to look at what happens when our royal ladies give birth,” said the novelist. “They are perceived as public property in the same way that Tudor women were perceived. It is simply turning the inidual woman back into a breeder.”Mantel’s comments echo her 2013 lecture at the British Museum, during which she said Kate Middleton appeared to have been “designed by a committee and built by craftsmen, with a perfect plastic smile and the spindles of her limbs hand-turned and gloss-varnished”.“These days, she is a mother-to-be, and draped in another set of threadbare attributions. Once she gets over being sick, the press will find that she is radiant. They will find that this young woman’s life until now was nothing, her only point and purpose being to give birth,” said Mantel, in a speech later described as “venomous” and “bitter” by the Daily Mail, and as “completely misguided and completely wrong” by David Cameron.Mantel pointed out that this was taking her comments out of context, saying: “My lecture and the subsequent essay was actually supportive of the royal family and when I used those words about the Duchess of Cambridge, I was describing the perception of her which has been set up in the tabloid press”.“I don’t believe for one moment that there was any lack of clarity, after all, I have been practising my trade for a number of years now,” said the novelist at the time. “It was a matter of taking the words completely out of context – twisting the context – and setting me up as a hate figure. I have absolutely no regrets. What I said was crystal clear.”The Mirror on the Light, concluding Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy, is published on Thursday, and has already been longlisted for the Women’s prize. The novelist told the BBC she would be delighted if it brought her an unprecedented third Booker prize. “Oh yes,” she said, asked if she’d like to win again. “Who wouldn’t?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aa7df9d0b93cb7f0eb7a860bc176c36822f718d/0_367_5530_3319/master/5530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73b93ee53b04e6c3f371f30558accf61","title":"tell us how has coronavirus affected small businesses in the uk","story":"We would like to hear about how the coronavirus outbreak has impacted small and medium enterprisesAnalysts have warned that transport groups, hospitality chains, and luxury goods makers and retailers will be among those hardest hit by the coronavirus.We want to hear from small and medium enterprises in the UK about how they have been affected by the outbreak.Have you noticed an impact on exports from China?

In less than a week, the former vice-president has walked out of the tomb of loser candidates into the glorious sunshine of frontrunner greatness.This is a remarkable turnaround by any measure. It also reflects no change in Biden’s qualities or character, and everything about a party with a singular focus on one factor: kicking Trump out of office.Super Tuesday’s super wins for Biden change nothing about his flaws as a candidate but they do underscore the strength of his sales pitch to a Trump-weary world.Biden’s wins also change nothing about Bernie Sanders’ strength as an insurgent critic of the establishment they may even boost them.But they most definitely blow a hole in his sales pitch to Democrats: that he can build a vast turnout machine to energize the base of the party to beat Donald Trump.Whatever Nevada bestowed on Bernie, the south hath taken away. In Las Vegas, Sanders seemed to build a erse coalition of supporters. But across the south, the bedrock of the party – African American voters in Virginia, the Carolinas and Alabama – made their choice of Biden so clear and loud, the cable networks didn’t wait to count the votes.Until now, the debate among nervous Democrats has been about whether the party’s superdelegates could take a contested convention away from Sanders. Could the party survive that schism, and would Bernie’s fans reconcile themselves to another nominee?But after Tuesday, there’s a vastly bigger question to consider. Could the party really nominate a candidate who isn’t competitive among the black voters who delivered such huge victories in the congressional contests in 2018, and the presidential contests of 2012 and 2008?There is precedent for what we’re witnessing. The last nominee to come back from the dead like this is actually Joe Biden’s friend and former fellow senator in all things foreign relations: John Kerry.Back in 2004, Democrats were on fire for another progressive Vermont firebrand. Howard Dean was building huge numbers of online donors and seemed to be the only candidate with an energized base to take on a deeply-polarizing president. But when big news broke through – at the time, the capture of Saddam Hussein – the contest flipped on its head. Kerry won in Iowa and never looked back. Within two months, Kerry had sewn the whole thing up.As the bumper stickers said at the time, Democrats dated Dean but they married Kerry. And the reason for the shift was their desperate desire to beat an incumbent president they loathed. The party wanted to leave as little room for error as possible, even though they knew that Kerry was a flawed frontrunner.Although we like to think that everything is different about Donald Trump, some things look pretty similar. Bush was hated around the world, seemed to be destroying core American values, and counted on the die-hard support of the conservative media echo chamber. Trump is all that on Viagra.It looks like Joe Biden is playing a similar role to John Kerry, and there are good reasons why. After all the turmoil of Trump, voters are understandably anxious to return to normal life. The global threat of a botched response to coronavirus underscores the catastrophic effects of an utterly incompetent, but perfectly sociopathic president.This is not a subtle choice, which is just as well, because the Trump campaign has all the subtlety of a jackboot.That’s why the collapse of Biden’s competition at the center of the party is not surprising. From Pete Buttigieg to Amy Klobuchar, the signs are clear: Democrats will not look favorably on anyone who interferes with their best chance to beat Trump.What is surprising is the speed of Biden’s turnaround. Just two weeks ago, reliable polling in Virginia suggested the race was tied. The speed and direction of this contest is not good for the Sanders campaign.Which takes us to the dismal news of the night. If you think Sanders fans were disappointed, you should talk to staffers and consultants propping up Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren. It feels odd to lump them together: one is plainly trying to buy his way to the nomination, the other has tried to wonk her way to it.However, Bloomberg’s poor showing on Super Tuesday simply reinforced how this contest is no different from all the others that came before it. You can dump a lot of money into the toilet bowl that is TV advertising, but you still can’t ignore the early states and jump straight into Super Tuesday.Warren’s bad night was arguably worse and far less fair on the merits. Bloomberg just wanted to be relevant Warren wanted to be right. She trounced the field on policy details and on the debate stage. But she wouldn’t or couldn’t turn her fire on Bernie, to consolidate the left behind a candidate with crossover appeal. So she ended up losing her home state of Massachusetts after running one of the very best campaigns of the cycle – and winning precisely nothing.Sanders himself declared victory with just two states under his belt, one of which is his home state of Vermont. “When we began this race for the presidency, everyone said it couldn’t be done,” he said in Essex Junction, Vermont. “We are going to win,” he continued as his fans chanted BER-NEE, BER-NEE, “we are going to defeat Trump because we are putting together an unprecedented grassroots multigenerational multiracial movement”.That movement somehow doesn’t include African Americans in the south.“You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” Sanders said, before attacking Biden for his vote on the war in Iraq. That was a debate from 18 years ago, which is approximately the age of Sanders’ most enthusiastic voters.By the time Sanders stopped talking, Biden had won another state – Arkansas – to add to another five he had already locked up early on Tuesday.Never mind that Biden started his victory speech by mistaking his sister for his wife. Or the way two protesters rushed on stage as he began to fire up the crowd.“For those who’ve been knocked down, counted out and left behind, this is your campaign,” he said. “I’m here to report this campaign is very much alive.”Biden’s revival after weeks of bad news is his model for the country’s revival after years of Trump news. “We are better than this moment,” Biden shouted. “We are better than this president!”He was speaking from a teleprompter, and yet he still screwed up plenty of lines. But Biden still landed some zingers, just as he scrapped out several big wins. As he walked off stage, he was declared the winner in Minnesota.Sanders’ victory in California will be a source of hope for his campaign. But scraping out a slender delegate lead is not the same as a multigenerational, multiracial movement to beat Trump. For now the momentum is with Biden: it’s his race to lose once again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c854ce851a1164bf15694b90ea0e641569fb913c/0_242_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee9ef23fb5d13061dd64d6ba86d9a4d7","title":"the guardian view on a royal coup a king overturns a historic election","story":"In 2018 Malaysians ousted not just a party that had ruled for six decades but a corrupt old order. A monarch’s act threatens to return it to powerIn a world where rulers with authoritarian and nationalist instincts have been steadily curbing political freedoms, the election of a multiracial reformist coalition in Malaysia two years ago was a heartening victory for democracy. Voters in 2018 threw out the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which had run Malaysia for 61 years and had, under prime minister Najib Razak, become a venal operation that stayed in power by stirring communal tensions and locking up critics. Unfortunately, UMNO is now on the brink of returning to office thanks to a royal coup enabled by hubris and infighting.At the heart of the story is the distrust between Mahathir Mohamad, the 94-year-old founding father of modern Malaysia, and his political rival and presumed successor, Anwar Ibrahim. These were the dominant figures of the Pakatan Harapan, the unwieldy coalition that had won the shock electoral victory in 2018. They fell out during a power struggle 20 years ago when Dr Mahathir was prime minister and Mr Anwar his deputy. That episode ended badly for Mr Anwar who went to prison on trumped-up sodomy charges, when his only offence was being charismatic and intelligent. Yet by 2018 they were reunited as political allies and defeated a kleptocratic government. Mr Mahathir became prime minister and Mr Anwar returned to parliament.The doubts and suspicions between the two men saw them struggle to introduce reforms and the economy spluttered. Old power brokers remained in place, biding their time until there was an opportunity to strike. That moment arose last month, when Dr Mahathir seemed to think he was being undermined and abruptly resigned. Yet the threat within was not from Mr Anwar, but rather Dr Mahathir’s deputy, Muhyiddin Yassin, who decided to walk out on his boss and leave the ruling coalition. Dr Mahathir had badly miscalculated in believing only he could hold the government together and would thereby be reappointed by the king, or Agong. In the event, the monarch passed over Dr Mahathir and decided to appoint the newly independent Mr Muhyiddin as prime minister, citing his ability to command a parliamentary majority.UMNO is the biggest party in Mr Muhyiddin’s putative coalition. There are well-grounded fears that if Mr Muhyiddin ends up in charge Mr Najib will pull the strings. This is at a time when Mr Najib is on trial for corruption charges and his aim will be to get off the hook. Mr Muhyiddin ought to be forced to test his claim of a majority. If he does not then Dr Mahathir and Mr Anwar, who say they have the 112 votes needed for a majority, must be given a chance to form the government. The mood music suggests the Agong could instead prorogue parliament – or even dissolve it and call fresh elections. This would be a mistake, creating a vacuum for nationalist or religious demagogues to fill. A king has overturned a democractic election result that challenged a corrupt old order. This is wrong and the world ought to call it out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a803faa685951bbe66d5f618bbfd0a8f685874e0/0_276_8318_4994/master/8318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf871ddbe34134c9fc786183e6447456","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of paradise","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘paradise’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘paradise’.Share your photos of what paradise means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 March at 10am.

I don’t like framing,” said Chanel’s artistic director, Virginie Viard, before the brand’s autumnwinter 2020 fashion show in Paris.. Its quite a statement of intent given the megabrand’s decades-long ownership of the concept of fashion show as theatrical blockbuster.So on Tuesday, there was no rocket taking off in the middle of the catwalk (2017) no supermarket complete with boxes of Chanel-branded ketchup bottles (2014). Instead, models walked against a glossy white set, with layers of curvy seating trimmed with black, recalling a map’s contour lines.Viard, Karl Lagerfeld’s long-term right-hand woman, has taken a softer, subtler approach since taking over after the legendary designer’s death just over a year ago. This collection continued in that vein, throwing the focus on to more than 70 mainly monochrome looks, with occasional hints of coral pink. Current trends were addressed puffy sleeves, Wolf Hall necklines and thigh high splits in midi skirts were all present.Models came two or three abreast at times. Gigi Hadid walked, arm in arm, between two other models, a move which felt protective given her altercation last season with a catwalk gatecrasher.Trousers came with poppers at the side, fanning open to display footwear described, in press notes, as “seven-league boots” – which according to Charles Perrault’s fairytales allow wearers to traverse seven leagues per step – inspired by a pair once worn by Lagerfeld.There was a New Romantic mood in those piratey, Adam Ant-ish boots and the many ruffle-fronted shirts Madonna and Boy George were evoked in the liberal use of crucifixes. Two large crucifixes were knitted into jumpers, recalling the Lacroix crucifix jacket famously chosen by Anna Wintour – controversially, at the time, paired with jeans – for her first Vogue cover in 1988. That 1980s-influenced crucifix was the main trend takeaway, and looked ripe for reinvention.Kanye West staged a more bombastic, Lagerfeld-esque spectacle the previous evening. In a contrarian move, as some other brands scaled back fashion week plans owing to coronavirus fears, the musician’s Yeezy label made a surprise last-minute entry on to the schedule.No designer since Giorgio Armani has loved beige as much as West, who brought sand and ochre to the catwalk, in a pumped-up version of the dusty, post-apocalyptic athleisure that has become his signature. Stand out pieces included funnel-necked irregularly undulating puffer jackets, although West’s six-year-old daughter, North West, stole the show when she took to the catwalk and rapped, and duly melted the internet.Stealing Paris fashion week must have been satisfying for West, whose last Paris show was his 2011 debut. Critics were underwhelmed then, and less forgiving than they might have been, given his prior declaration that the show would “change the course of fashion”. Since then, however, that prophecy has come true, particularly in the trainer market. West’s much-copied Yeezy line racked up sales of more than $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in 2019, the bulk of which from the ubiquitous, squishy wedge-shaped Yeezy Boost 350s.Earlier on Tuesday, Gucci cancelled its cruise show, which had been scheduled to take place in San Francisco on 18 May. The move was made in response to “the ongoing uncertainty prompted by the coronavirus outbreak, as a precautionary measure”, according to a company statement.Tokyo fashion week, which was set to take place from 16-21 March, has also been cancelled. Prada has also postponed its 21 May cruise show, which was set to take place in Tokyo, although Armani, Chanel, Dior and Max Mara’s cruise shows are still taking place in April and May. Aside from a few cancelled events on the periphery, Paris fashion week has largely gone ahead, and will close with the Louis Vuitton show late on Tuesday.The economic impact of the coronavirus is likely to be heavily felt in fashion. It has been forecast that the luxury market could lose €30-40bn in sales this year, as the industry suffers from store closures and disrupted supply chains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ea998bc67d9d5057e4d17615e5db741308c76e/0_0_600_360/master/600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5e9133531e920af7eacd907cba8e627","title":"kim novak having fat injections in my cheeks was the worst thing i could have done","story":"The star of Vertigo on her favourite outfits, taking artistic inspiration from Hitchcock – and dealing with abuse from TrumpI think this look was ahead of its time.

Email feast@theI’ve stopped eating tomatoes for health reasons, but I like cooking Italian food. Are there any alternatives to tomatoes in dishes such as lasagne and caponata?Charles, North YorkshireTomatoes were a relatively late addition to Italian cuisine, with pasta sauces and braises coloured red in only the late 16th and 17th century. As the ’s food writer in Rome Rachel Roddy – whose use of the fruit has decreased since moving to Italy – puts it, we need to move away from tomato domination. “So many Italian dishes, such as hunter’s chicken, braised rabbit or oxtail stew, have a pre-tomato version,” she says, “and eight times out of 10, I prefer them.”Seek out the original versions, then focus on your use of olive oil, garlic, chilli and, if you’re making pasta sauce, the starchy pasta cooking water. Roddy has a few tricks, though, for achieving that umami flavour when tomatoes aren’t in play: “Anchovies, parmesan, porcini and herbs, such as rosemary and sage, can give that meatiness you might otherwise miss.”Lasagne is also within your grasp, Charles. Trivelli’s favourite (tomato or otherwise) is an artichoke version: remove the tough outer leaves, pare away the green flesh from the base of the artichoke and stem, scrape out the hairy choke, then slice, cook and use to layer up between sheets of lasagne, bechamel and cheese.Slow-cooked red peppers, if you can eat them, give a good base for sauces, stews and spooning over mozzarella or burrata, says Tim Siadatan, chef and co-owner of Padella, a second site of which has just opened in Shoreditch. “Put them on a charcoal grill or barbecue to get a lovely, smoky flavour,” he says, but a gas stove will also work. Cook the peppers until the outsides are nice and blistered, then transfer to a bowl and cover to steam. Once they are cool enough to handle, Siadatan peels off the skin, removes the seeds and finely slices. Then, in a separate pan, he adds “a load of sliced garlic and some dried chilli, and sweats down in olive oil over a low heat until they’re sweet and sticky.” Season with salt and pepper, add a splash of cabernet sauvignon vinegar, some fresh marjoram (if you can’t find any, use basil) and a dollop of mascarpone or creme fraiche, and you’ll have a creamy sauce to wrap around penne.Alternatively, Siadatan says, “add cooked runner beans cut into inch-long pieces with some mascarpone and basil, and you’ve got a garnish for lamb or throw in some chickpeas, lentils or other pulses for a stewy vibe.” Life without tomatoes can still be rosy.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

And the boyhood Evertonian could hardly have chosen better opponents to punish. The midfielder’s Chelsea career since his move from Goodison Park in January 2018 can be best described as stop-start.Nobody doubts Barkley’s ability when it is his day. It is just that those days have been too scarce. Everything came together for him in a performance of touch and influence and the goal he scored to smooth Chelsea’s passage into the FA Cup quarter-finals was the defining moment.Seizing on a loose ball 10 yards inside his own half, he sprinted away from the Liverpool midfielder Fabinho and, when he reached the edge of the area, with Joe Gomez backing off, he unfurled a venomous drive that ripped past Adrián. It was the first time in 12 games he had scored against Liverpool.Chelsea’s form has been poor since late November and they entered the tie having won only one of their previous six in the Premier League – and that is not to mention the Champions League hammering against Bayern Munich.This was better from them, a keeping alive of their final realistic shot at silverware this season but, from a Liverpool point of view, it was another strangely ineffective performance to follow Saturday’s shock 3-0 league defeat at Watford.The pre-match talk had taken in the need to show a reaction to the sudden end of their epic 44-match unbeaten league run. Instead they slipped to a third away defeat in a row – the first was not necessarily terminal, the 1-0 against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League. It was a match when Klopp could not only lament what he described as bad concessions but his team could get little going in attack. There was intensity to the performance but not enough by way of incision.The tone was set for Liverpool when Adrián allowed a Willian shot to slip through his fingers for 1-0 – a horrible mistake – and, although Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was restored by Frank Lampard to the Chelsea team, made fine saves, Chelsea might have scored more.For Lampard, the positives were plentiful, with the recall of Arrizabalaga not the only selection decision to pay off. Playing at the base of a three-man midfield, Billy Gilmour was the star turn. The 18-year-old read the game superbly, he won tackles, his passing was simple but effective and the sight of him stepping away from red shirts with the ball at his feet became a feature of the match. There was also the moment when he tricked Fabinho with a wonderful piece of skill. Lampard described him as “immaculate”.This was the first time Klopp had been in the FA Cup fifth round, his record in the competition having been decidedly patchy in his previous four attempts, and he went stronger than expected with his lineup. He prioritised experience over youth, although he did start the teenagers Neco Williams and Curtis Jones. The latter showed tremendous confidence in possession but he did lose out to the impressive Pedro in the buildup to Barkley’s goal.Errors were a theme a by-product, perhaps, of the game’s break-neck pace. Kurt Zouma and Antonio Rüdiger almost let in Liverpool during the early running, with Arrizabalaga bailing out his team with a decent stop to deny Sadio Mané on the second occasion.The biggest slip, though, came from Adrián. It followed a risky sequence of Liverpool passes out from the back – into the Chelsea press – with Gomez putting Fabinho into trouble, him losing out and Willian taking aim from the edge of the area.Seconds earlier, after a Pedro shot had deflected kindly, Willian put his laces through the ball and was denied by Adrián’s strong hands. It was an eye-catching save. But this time, although the shot was straight at him, Adrián lost his concentration and fumbled it into the net.Pedro and César Azpilicueta had earlier had chances for Chelsea and, after Adrián’s lapse, the spotlight picked out Arrizabalaga. It has been a testing time for the Spaniard, with Euro 2020 in sight. How can he push his claim to start with his national team from the sidelines at Stamford Bridge?Arrizabalaga needed a big performance and he stood tall before the interval, his high point being the triple save to deny Mané, Divock Origi and Jones, a celebration of bravery, positioning and reflexes. There would also be another to thwart Mané after a quicksilver burst from the forward.Lampard has had reason to bemoan injuries, with Andreas Christensen, N’Golo Kanté, Christian Pulisic, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham already out of action. The situation became worse when Mateo Kovacic limped off after 42 minutes and Willian did likewise early in the second half.Both suffered achilles damage, with Lampard reporting the latter “did not feel too bad”. Kovacic was “slightly worse”and in addition Lampard will be without Jorginho for the next three matches because of suspension.Chelsea pressed on and they thought they had the second goal when Mason Mount bent a free-kick he had won himself over the wall only for it to catch the top of the crossbar.Barkley brought the ruthlessness and Liverpool’s pain would have been more acute had Pedro not shot weakly at Adrián when one on one after a mix-up between Williams and Gomez or if the goalkeeper had not tipped a shot from Olivier Giroud against the crossbar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92210462cd9d982d3f3bbbd9c529ea7e9bd89345/0_98_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=557114f493d8ce00d0ce74c8ff426d83","title":"kane and rashford could play at euro 2020 says gareth southgate","story":"Gareth Southgate is optimistic about the possibility of Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford being fit for Euro 2020 and has left the door open for Phil Foden as he anticipated another competitive year of international football.Southgate was in Amsterdam for the Nations League draw, the Uefa competition that gives England the chance to lay the ghosts of 2016 after they were drawn against Iceland, as well as Denmark and Belgium, in group A2.Whatever the moderate advantages of the new tournament it is not the main event this year and Southgate is already thinking about the summer. England kick off their Euro 2020 campaign at Wembley on 14 June against Croatia but much can change between now and then as he is well aware.Southgate is without his two first‑choice strikers but he talked positively about the recovery being made by Kane and Rashford, two players who would be definite starters in his team were they to make it.“We’ve had really good updates right the way through and Harry and Marcus are exactly where we were expecting them to be,” Southgate said. “Both players will give themselves the best possible chance of being available, that’s their mentality and that’s their dedication to their sport.“That’s the only bit we can guarantee, what we can’t guarantee is how that rehab will develop as it’s stepped up and as it becomes more intense. But they are both on track from the information we were given at the very start.”This is an uncertain time for Southgate and there is much he cannot guarantee. One is the effect the coronavirus most immediately, England’s friendly with Italy.“The reality is that we don’t know,” he said. “It is an ever-changing picture for everybody, in every walk of life, so we are updated all the time by government but of course none of us know what the next few weeks will hold.”Other unknowns for Southgate are on the pitch, such as the risk of more injury or players going out of form. Jordan Pickford is one who falls into the latter category, with his mistake against Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes on Sunday putting the Everton goalkeeper in the spotlight. He has been consistent for England and Southgate stood behind his player.“His performances for us throughout have been outstanding,” the manager said. “I think he has been a key part of some big results we have had. I think that is clear to everybody but in goal, if you are the England goalkeeper, you are under the spotlight. I am expecting him to bounce back. The weekend goal is one he would want to do better with but then he had some outstanding saves at the end of the game. That is the life of a goalkeeper.”One final thing Southgate has no real control over is the number of players from whom he can choose. He believes he has 70 eligible players in the Premier League, meaning each ought to be under his consideration for selection. Some are more demanding of his attention than others, one being Foden after his performance for Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final.“The door’s open for everybody,” Southgate said. “We’ve got 70 English players in the league and when they’re of the quality of a player like Phil then of course the door’s open.”In the Nations League, the other home nations were all in League B and avoided one another in the draw, though Wales will face the Republic of Ireland in group B4 alongside Bulgaria and Finland.Scotland will play Israel, their European Championship play‑off opponents, as well as Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Northern Ireland will face Norway, Austria and Romania."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8a0a165e920f722b9b517c71b9b21e33f8b702/4_0_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b4994b3b4c9cd7afa47b2ca805c87d0","title":"west bromwich albion newcastle united fa cup fifth round match report","story":"It may not come to that, Newcastle could enjoy a Cup run and stay up, especially if they can keep up this new-found facility for scoring goals. Certainly their following have not enjoyed themselves as loudly or as long all season, though they cannot expect to play West Brom every week.The unexpected defeat by Wigan in the last match seemed to have knocked the confidence of the Championship leaders, whose team selection left no one in doubt promotion is their overriding priority. That said, Newcastle fans were peeping through their fingers at the end as the home side successfully chipped away at what should have been an unassailable 3-0 lead.“It wouldn’t be Newcastle without a drama,” Steve Bruce said. “We made hard work of it after playing well. The last 10 minutes spoiled it for us a little bit. We have to stop switching off in matches.”Slaven Bilic was disappointed. “We are not a club that wants to be proud of going close,” the West Brom manager said. “We gave them far too much respect for an hour. We showed character in coming back but I cannot be happy with the result.”The game was lively from the off. Newcastle had a chance to go in front in under three minutes when Gareth Barry was caught in possession just outside his own area but though Nabil Bentaleb squared to the better placed Almirón the Paraguayan’s first touch let him down when he would have been clear on goal. Not to be outdone West Brom came straight down the field and almost scored at the other end, Kyle Edwards putting a lot of power into his shot from the edge of the area yet finding Karl Darlow’s reactions equal to it.Newcastle were doing most of the attacking by the mid-point of the first half, as befitted a side that had only made a conservative six changes from their last league game. Bilic’s response to losing at home to Wigan at the weekend was to replace nine of his players, which made you wonder whether either side really wanted to reach the sixth round. Newcastle had gone four league games without a goal and really needed something to show for their first-half superiority, because the long wait seemed to be affecting their composure in attack. When a corner dropped invitingly to Sean Longstaff on the edge of the area he had time to line up a shot but in his haste he hit the ball early and wide.When Allan Saint-Maximin hit the post with a dipping drive from 30 yards it began to appear Newcastle’s luck might be out but the same player managed to change that impression just past the half hour with a telling midfield break and a neat ball behind the West Brom central defenders for Almirón to run on to.This time he was clear on goal and made no mistake, calmly waiting for Johnathan Bond to commit himself before slipping the ball past him. The 5,000 travelling fans at the opposite end reacted to the first Toon goal in over six hours with wild celebrations and a few premature mentions of Wembley, which is fair enough considering they had not seen their side reach the fifth round for 14 years, let alone take a lead.Right on the stroke of the interval that lead was doubled, with Almirón striking again to record his first Newcastle double. When Joelinton received the ball following a Valentino Lazaro run down the right he was facing away from goal, and his improvised backheel towards the penalty spot looked hopeful, yet Almirón not only reached it at a stretch he managed to find the top corner in the act of sliding to the floor.The tie seemed to be over when the visitors scored a third just minutes into the second half. Almirón and Saint-Maximin combined once again, and though the latter put his cross too close to the goalkeeper all Bond could manage was to push the ball into the oncoming Lazaro, who bundled it over the line.

Failing to make women aware of that possibility would also be in breach of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidelines.As a result of the inquiry, the health minister Nadine Dorries will write to all heads and directors of midwifery and medical directors at NHS trusts this week to remind them of the Nice guidance regarding pain relief during childbirth and to ensure it is being followed.Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said the “results of the government’s inquiry are sadly not surprising”.She added: “We have spoken with many women who have been so traumatised by their experience of childbirth that they are considering ending what would otherwise be wanted pregnancies.“Pain relief is sometimes treated as a ‘nice extra’ rather than an integral part of maternity care, and women and their families can suffer profoundly as a result.“Staffing shortages may be an issue but we also know women may experience gatekeeping by healthcare professionals and be told labour ‘is meant to be hard work’,” she added.Maureen Treadwell, from the Birth Trauma Association also welcomed the findings: “We are delighted, at long last, that the Department for Health and Social Care is looking seriously at this issue. Inadequate epidural services and misinformation about risks is simply inexcusable. It is both inhumane and discriminatory.”Epidural blocks are a pain-relieving spinal injection that must be given by an anaesthetist in an obstetric unit. They are effective but not risk-free. Among other risks, they can lead to a drop in blood pressure.NHS guidelines say that women in labour can ask for epidurals at any time, including during the early stage of labour, and should be given information and support to choose what is right for them.But in January, a Sunday  investigation claimed some women were being denied epidurals because of what the paper said was a “cult of natural childbirth” in some NHS Trusts.Bogod said that “there’s reasonable, anecdotal evidence that some midwives will use the excuse that an anaesthetist isn’t available if they themselves feel an epidural isn’t appropriate for the woman based on their own beliefs around intervention-free births”.“The national standard is that a woman should be given an epidural within 30 minutes to one hour of asking for it, except in exceptional circumstances,” he said. “Labour wards are amply supplied with anaesthetists and so that isn’t an unreasonable target for us.“The commonest reason for women to be denied an epidural is because of a lack in midwife numbers: we have a drastic national shortage of midwives,” he added. The NHS in England is short of the equivalent of almost 2,500 full-time midwives.Bogod pointed to the scandals at Telford’s Princess Royal and the Royal Shrewsbury hospitals, and Morecambe Bay, where babies and mothers died preventable deaths at least partly because midwives had a focus on making women giving birth without medical intervention.“I’m not saying it’s common or regular but there are anecdotal cases,” he said. “But it’s completely unacceptable.”Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, (RCM) said: “Nice guidelines should be followed. Women should get pain relief when they ask. They should be making choices about their pain relief armed with the information they need to make an informed choice, so they get the pain relief that is right for them.”Walton, however, said it was a lack of anaesthetists that sometimes led to delays in epidurals being administered. “Unfortunately, due to stretched resources anaesthetists are not always available, which poses real challenges for midwives seeking the best experience for women in labour,” she said.The debate over medicalised births is long-running. RCM abandoned its normal birth campaign in 2017 amid concerns it may have put women at risk. But earlier this month University Hospitals Bristol NHS trust was criticised for advising pregnant women to avoid having epidurals. After the advice was reported in the media, the trust deleted the childbirth advice from its website and accepted it was “outdated”.Pat O’Brien, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at University College London hospitals and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians \u0026amp Gynaecologists, said although there may still be pockets of midwives encouraging women to have non-medicalised births against their wishes, attitudes have changed “drastically” in the last few years.“Ten years ago, you would often see it,” he said. “But there has been a real culture shift in the last few years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4254c88ec6345b004a60e48cb4920d856c2beb9/0_0_5034_3355/master/5034.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e6f17a25b60d37ac08d0899411dc451f","title":"whats behind the rise of germanys far right","story":"A terrorist attack in Hanau was the latest incident of far-right violence in Germany.

It has requested licences to clear thousands of hectares of Cerrado land, on top of at least 30,000 hectares that it cleared between 2011 and 2017, which resulted in the Norwegian government pension fund esting from the group.Though the company has government licences for the Cerrado land it is clearing and does not regard this clearance as deforestation, such clearances are controversial. Jair Bolsonaro’s government has drawn widespread criticism for allowing land to be cleared and burned in the Amazon and elsewhere in Brazil.Odey Asset Management donated £10,000 to Johnson for his leadership bid and has donated at least £1.7m to the Tories and the pro-Brexit campaign in the last decade. The company is understood to have a sizeable stake in SLC Agricola.Alasdair Cameron, an investigator at Friends of the Earth, said: “While Johnson talks of protecting and restoring the world’s ecosystems, he and his party gladly accepted donations from an investor profiting from the destruction of Brazilian forests.“The burning of tropical forests is not accidental – it is driven by the demand for soy, beef and other commodities. In the run-up to Cop26, it is worrying to see that the cosy relationship between environmentally destructive industries and UK politics is still going on.”A spokesperson for Odey Asset Management told the : “As active fund managers, we seek to invest in companies that we determine have a promising future, and one of the inputs to that evaluation is how those companies are using or adopting sustainable practices.“Brazil has formed a vital part of increased global agricultural output, that has allowed food to be cheaper in real terms than ever before, and enabled a growing global population to feed and clothe itself. SLC Agricola is a good corporate citizen that abides by relevant legislation and adopts the most modern agricultural technology to maximise yield and use land efficiently.”SLC Agricola said it had not deforested without licences and did not have a zero-deforestation policy. The company said it had converted 1,500 hectares of land to farming in the three years from 2017 to 2019, all of which was Cerrado land. The company said its current strategy was focused not on “the acquisition of raw land for conversion, as was the case in the past,” but on already developed areas and leased instead of owned land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a6a2207406240ad3bfa6f1a8a5bb5ae0f663274/0_245_1633_980/master/1633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dda98d703893b2925f344e9a17e7de68","title":"from the tech hound to the new parents what kind of skier are you","story":"Whether you’re skiing for the first time, a show-off or après-ski royalty, here’s how to make the most of the slopes this seasonThe tech hound may be looking at you but they’re not actually listening to a word you say. They’re too busy analysing their data – which they’ll share with you at every opportunity. Speed, distance, altitude, vertical drop, crystals captured … friends of the tech hound may want to take their own noise-cancelling headphones on holiday.The tech hound laughs in the face of unplugging for a digital-free ski break. They have a camera in their helmet, an augmented reality version of the slopes playing in their goggles and smart boots fitted with a wearable device to deliver real-time audio ski coaching tips via an app. They’d be filming it all on their drone if the devices weren’t banned from most ski resorts.Tips for tech hounds: Check in with your resort to see what tech is on offer before you arrive. For instance, Club Med has introduced digital RFID bracelets, which provide room access and easy payment around the resort property. Perfect for the techy on the slopes.For the show-off, the mountain is a mere background wallpaper in the story of their life, the gondola is a place to do their makeup, and their skis purely a means of transport to push from one epic selfie spot to another. Of which there are so many all around.The show-off works best on bluebird days and hides in the hotel during photographically challenging blizzards or whiteouts. They used to hang out at the snow park taking selfies at the top of the half pipe until someone pushed them off the lip one day. They got stuck in the centre and had to be pulled out by mountain rescue on a skidoo. Still, it made a good Instagram story.Tips for show-offs: Keep your phone in an inside jacket pocket as close to your body as possible, as cold temperatures will make your battery run out more quickly.Resort pick: Club Med Val Thorens is the perfect base to tick off the 3 Vallées selfie spot trail.“How hard can it be?” thought the first-timer. They’d seen Ski Sunday and watched a couple of YouTube tutorials on the flight over. The first-timer was used to success, unaccustomed to failure, which might explain why they asked for expert skis at the hire shop. And then proceeded to almost twist a knee when their binding didn’t release during a pile-up, which they themselves had caused by skiing into a group getting off the chairlift.At least it saved them from taking on the icy black run they were about to attempt, though. The lifties bundled the first-timer back down the way they came, to the safety of the green runs and covered magic carpet. And there they skied, with their bum in the air as is the form for all beginners who don’t have lessons, being overtaken by kids half their size, until the end of their holiday.Tips for first-timers: Get lessons. There’s no shame in ski school. It’s the quickest way to progress, and even advanced skiers will improve with some tailored tuition. And thanks to Club Med’s partnership with Ecole du Ski Français (ESF), customers get free lessons (available Monday to Friday).Après-ski royalty does not care about first lifts. They’re not even sure they exist, though they did hear someone mention the concept once. Just before midday is when après-ski royalty likes to head up the mountain to avoid the afternoon lift pass rush. Queues are not their scene at all.They might do a red run, a quick head-clearer, with a pace and poise that belies the little amount of time they actually spend on snow rather than in the bar. And then it’s time to settle down for lunch at a sunny outdoor deck with a cocktail or two, moving to each new après spot like clockwork with the sun as it shifts around the mountain.At three, it’s time for the VIP bar at La Folie Douce, where they’ll dance on a table draped in a sea of feather boas. Obvs. As the sun starts to set, après-ski royalty styles it down the mountain and heads home.Tips for après-ski royalty: Research happy hour slots and the best après spots in advance so you can plan your route with precision.Resort pick: Club Med Alpe d’Huez is a top resort for après-ski vibes, with one of the finest Folie Douce in the Alps.The new parents stand at the top of the chairlift scratching their heads. They’re sure they’ve forgotten something. Gloves, poles, phone, oh yes, they remember, we have a child now! But it’s OK, she’s in nursery today. Blinking into the morning sun, the dad remembers he left his goggles on the changing mat, while the mum wonders if the white on her jacket is milk, baby sick or snow.Then they push off – it feels weird at first, but they embrace their newfound freedom, skiing together in the endless white. It’s just like the old days, except this morning they have the slopes to themselves as only new parents and powder hounds are up this early.They’re exhausted by lunchtime and downing double espressos to get through the afternoon, but they return to their child with a sparkle in their eyes. They only planned to use the odd day of nursery, but they sign their beloved up for the rest of the week.Tips for new parents: All-inclusive snow trips are a great option for families with young children, thanks to their on-site nurseries, child-friendly meal provision, and day-long kids’ clubs.Resort pick: Club Med Les Arcs Panorama, where the Club Med has one of the best childcare setups in the Alps.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b79e90e9569133d7cce95f37dec74b85f069d02/0_354_5314_3189/master/5314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92424137c2aa5cc8cc1016ca7a6ab07d","title":"win an all inclusive ski holiday for two","story":"Enjoy a luxurious week in the snow with an all-inclusive week-long stay in the new Club Med Alpe d’Huez resort – enter now for your chance to winSki season is here and the mountains are calling.

Unless the question is: “Which ski resorts are best at search engine optimisation?”Here’s everything you need to know about skiing in France, Switzerland and Japan.Family-friendly fun in FranceTypical ski season: December-MayThe appeal is helped by France’s proximity to the UK, which means short flight times and plenty of low-cost airline choice, along with the opportunity to drive or take the environmentally-friendly train option.And French resorts are especially good for family snow trips, thanks to their English-speaking ski schools, tailored beginner areas and fun snow parks for kids. Many resorts also have an impressive array of non-ski activities to keep things enjoyable for children.Nestled in an enchanted pine forest at 1,750 metres, Club Med Les Arcs Panorama is a great choice for families, as it’s right on the slopes and has children’s classes and clubs available from four months up. Kids will love the playful animal sculptures dotted around the property, the ski trails through the woods and the resort’s famed toboggan runs.A luxury treat in SwitzerlandTypical ski season: November-MaySkiing in Switzerland is for those who want to push the boat out – a place of chocolate box beauty, where time appears to have stood still. But its popularity with Britons is also because it boasts some of the best ski resorts in Europe, with great pistes for all levels, excellent snow records, and renowned ski schools.Saint-Moritz was the world’s first winter sports resort and continues to have a reputation for glitz and glamour. By staying at the Club Med Saint-Moritz Roi Soleil you can enjoy all the chicness from a safe distance, knowing the price of your all-inclusive holiday was fixed in advance.

Yes, you have to travel farther, but once you’re there Japan will more than deliver on the experience, as more and more British travellers are discovering each year.Hokkaido in the north of the country is the premier spot for skiing and snowboarding.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said life expectancy for women at birth increased to 83.6 years in 2019, up four months compared with 2018. For men the increase was three months, taking their life expectancy to 79.9 years.The rises represent the biggest jump since the start of the decade. Longevity improvements in England first faltered in 2011 and had plateaued since 2013, with critics blaming austerity and NHS cuts. Among women, life expectancy fell in both 2012 and 2015.Increases in life expectancy in 2019 were across the board at all age levels. The ONS said a woman who has reached 65 years old can now expect to live another 21.5 years, up three months on the figure it reported in 2018. Men at age 65 will live on average another 19.1 years, up from 18.8 years in 2018.Changes to longevity have huge implications for pensions. The slowing in life expectancy had prompted some calls for a review of the increase in the state pension age. Former pension minister Steve Webb, now a consultant with actuaries LCP, cautioned against reading too much into any one set of figures, saying that a cold winter, a warm summer or viruses can have a big impact on the data. The ONS said the figures for 2019 were “provisional”.“‘An improvement in life expectancy data is very good news, though we should be wary of reading too much into a single year’s figures,” Webb said.“It is also true that these averages conceal a great deal of variation between different parts of the country and different groups. Assuming these new figures represent a return to the upward trend of life expectancy, this should put an end to insurance companies being able to ‘bank’ profits where their assumptions about improving life expectancy has not been met.“From the point of view of the inidual saver, these figures are reminder that the average man or woman at 65 can expect to have to manage their pension pot for a good two decades. For all the talk of ‘working til we drop’, in reality retirements for many people are going to be longer than in the past and we need to think hard about helping people make good choices with their money not just at retirement but all the way through retirement,” said Webb.The figures are also likely to prompt fresh debate about the impact of austerity. Last month a landmark review by Sir Michael Marmot found that life expectancy had stalled for the first time in more than 100 years and even reversed for the most deprived women in society. It found that not only were lifes stalling, but people are living longer in poor health.Pensions and investments adviser Tom Selby, of stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Politically speaking, some people might take these ONS figures as confirmation of the impact of austerity – in that the halt in longevity increases coincided with cuts to services. But the figures are quite volatile and, while it’s positive news that longevity is increasing again, we can’t be sure they are not going to plateau again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707fa2b94e73ba6e566db2307244a83d8f3fd75a/0_115_5126_3076/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1f22a49e2fac3cb06c6bfd34ae63f6","title":"lost decade hidden story how austerity broke britain","story":"What happened in the UK between 2010 and 2020 will scar us for the rest of our lives. David Cameron’s Conservatives, only just victorious in the 2010 election, sold austerity as a necessary response to the 2008 financial crash. The exact social consequences of these cuts were spelled out last week in Michael Marmot’s report for the Institute of Health Equity: for the first time in a century, life expectancy has stopped growing and for women in poor areas actually fallen.We should never stop reminding ourselves just what an astonishing decade we have lived through. In the aftermath of the crash, employment climbed and stayed remarkably high. But these new jobs paid badly and it took until two months ago for earnings to reach where they were before 2008. It is no surprise that debt is mountainous: each household owes on average £15,385, not counting their mortgages. The gap between rich and poor has widened the young are now worse off than their parents at their age home ownership has declined steeply – families are stuck in life-long and precarious private renting.In our 2010 book The Verdict, we evaluated the Blair-Brown era, years of marked social progress. For a new investigation, to assess the extent of the past decade’s damage, we went back to the people we talked to then to see how they have fared since and the hidden ways that austerity has affected their lives.We followed the fortunes of Emma Percy, in Folkestone, Kent. With her husband, Rob, and three children, the family moved from one rented home to another, changing the children’s schools as rents rose, roofs leaked. They were sometimes living without a functioning boiler all winter long. They were the “just about managing”. Theresa May never got round to helping. Emma and Rob did all the striving and aspiring the prime minister had called for, hoping to save for a deposit, but never quite making enough. In the summer, the only holiday they could afford was camping in the grounds of the school where Rob was caretaker. Their parents own homes they may never.Decades take shape in the rearview mirror. Even as the past decade was unfolding, people were aware times were out of joint, an unprecedented number telling a Hansard Society survey at the end of 2018 that the UK was in decline. Everyone saw that pressing national tasks were neglected, as carbon cuts and affordable housing targets were missed, as transport worsened along with education and productivity. Instead, massive efforts were erted into ideological futility. On the whims of ministers, probation was broken apart, forensic services wrecked and enormous effort wasted on pushing England’s schools out of public control into semi-private academies and trusts, in evidence-free reorganisations. People expect someone to monitor air and water quality, inspect restaurants and food standards. But the environmental health officers we visited in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, were inspecting fewer kebab shops and closing air-monitoring stations despite more pollution. We were there on an inspection when they found a stack of meat pies on the dirty floor of a roadside cafe: the officer told us they register fewer food outlets as high risk, for lack of staff to check them. Nationally, one in 10 takeaways now score zero or one for hygiene and safety. Andy Birks, a butcher in Rotherham in South Yorkshire, told us he hadn’t seen a health inspector in years. “I don’t think there are any left,” he said. Like so many high-street shops, his business had declined in the decade since we first met him, his profits down since 2010.A Friday night in the control room with Bedfordshire police told the same story of services stretched to breaking point. Mental health and domestic violence dominated the calls. A neighbour reported a man next door banging on his wife’s window, threatening violence. A man called as he chased his son across a dark park, terrified he might harm himself. The chief constable, Jon Boutcher, had just written to his MP recounting a typical night of rapes, stabbings and a lethal traffic accident involving young children. “I run out of officers regularly for 999 calls,” he said.In Hastings, East Sussex, we watched the closure of another day centre, the building sold by the cash-strapped council. This was the seventh of these havens for older adults to close in the town since 2010. As packing cases were being filled with pictures from the walls, we talked to Rose, Mary and Sal, old friends sitting together as they always did, but now for the last time. Home alone, the statistics showed that many more would arrive in A\u0026ampE malnourished or dehydrated. That is the constant perversity of austerity scrimping a bit now to cost more later.Everywhere, we found a sense of common belonging diminished, with fewer meeting places, playing fields sold off, museums and libraries closed. As the public realm shrank, so did social capital, found the ONS, with less trust and neighbours not talking to one another. Pub closures – premises were down from 52,500 in 2001 to 38,000 by 2020 – were another loss of sociability.Cameron’s “big society” gimmick delivered a smaller one, as people donated less to charities and volunteering declined. Foreign journalists filmed the Britain of food banks, the homeless, payday loans, bedroom tax and zero-hours jobs. The Conservatives’ pitch in 2010 had been repairing “broken Britain”, but its cracks were widened by an austerity that was neither necessary nor inevitable but resulted from ideological choices. The cap on housing benefit created socially segregated no-go areas for low earners. Councils lost a third of their spending power: buses, planning, housing, youth services and sports facilities were cut or sold off. Nature suffered: Natural England, custodian of flora and fauna in national parks, lost half its budget and shed 1,000 inspectors. Eleven million trees were promised, 1.4m planted.One service always in the public eye was the NHS. But its 2010 training cuts left it short of 100,000 nurses and doctors. Spending time with the chief executive of Ipswich hospital, we watched as he begged a senior nurse not to leave. Jenny (not her real name), one of his best, brightest and most dedicated nurses, had turned around his difficult chemotherapy ward, caring for seriously ill people feeling at their worst, where deaths of patients exacted a heavy emotional toll on staff. But, taking a deep breath, she told him: “I just can’t keep going.” She would join the nursing bank for occasional shifts, but her departure would add to the 41,000 nurse vacancies. Her team cried when she told them.The public realm now employs a smaller proportion of the workforce than at any time since 1945. For every £100 for public services in 2010, only £86 in real terms was spent in 2020. Rebuilding schools and hospitals stopped dead. A quarter of local government jobs vanished, with youth workers tackling knife crime the first to go. Criminal justice was hard hit: courts closed prisons overflowed with violence and drug abuse rife legal aid was pared to nothing. The armed forces were not spared. Grants to arts organisations fell by a third, funding for national galleries and museums by a half.It is a perverse society that chooses to harm its youngest most, but years of frozen benefits left families thousands of pounds short, while the old saw their triple-locked pensions rise. State spending per child fell from £11,300 to £10,000. Early intervention for families was so scarce that the numbers of children in care rose fast. Psychiatrists estimated that one in five girls and young women had cut, burned or poisoned themselves in deliberate acts of self-harm on a rising trend: waiting lists for help stretched to a year in some places. Children deprived at school of art, music and drama teaching have lost that chance for ever, with only half taking any arts exams, and trips out severely cut. In 2018, 130 libraries shut and 760 youth clubs closed. This year begins with a million lost young people classified as “Neet” not in employment or education.Child poverty soared to its highest level since before the second world war. Infant mortality rose for the first time in two generations. The Thomas Coram Research Institute collected children’s own accounts: “I was so hungry, it was like I got hit in my belly, like I got stabbed with a knife,” 14-year-old Emmanuel told it. The threshold for claiming free school meals halved. More than 2,000 food banks opened, four times more in districts where universal credit – one of the decade’s greatest, but by no means only, disasters – was rolled out. Ministers’ talk of “scroungers” hardened public hearts. In Knowsley, on Merseyside, a food bank organiser collecting donations was asked: “Is this for English people?” He replied: “It’s for hungry people.”Of course, these years were not monochrome. Plenty of good happened because people are admirably resilient: we found enterprise, generosity and public servants holding it all together with superhuman effort. Despite cuts to subsidies, renewable energy outdid expectations. Film studios flourished, UK acting grabbed glittering prizes and athletes triumphed. But everywhere decaying high streets were a metaphor for national malaise, as internet retail sucked the life out of bricks-and-mortar shops, its US owners paying negligible tax to compensate.At the other end of the scale, the decade’s winners won big. Jeff Fairburn of Persimmon’s £75m bonus was emblematic profits poured into his pockets from a misdirected “help to buy” subsidy. Total wealth in second homes, buy-to-lets and flats on the Costa climbed to £941bn. The UK still had more highly paid bankers than the rest of the EU put together. As GDP and pay growth both slowed, profits rose. A third of the UK’s billionaires kept their money in tax havens: the May government backed off from forcing transparency on crown dependencies and, coincidentally, tax exiles donated handsomely to the Conservative party’s 2017 election costs. HMRC cut local offices at the expense of precious local knowledge, a Sheffield accountant told us. Amid austerity, 15,600 tax collectors were dispensed with and the NAO reported 4m calls to HMRC went unanswered £35bn went uncollected.British business stayed virtually mute on Brexit, in self-harming silence, fearing public scrutiny of its stratospheric director remuneration, dysfunctional boardrooms and negligent auditors. The small businesspeople we spoke to were often pro-Brexit, refusing to see any bigger picture. A Dartmoor sheep farmer and a Hastings fisherman stayed believers, despite not expecting Brexit to do them much good. A steel stockholder in Derby and a high-street butcher saw turnover drop but stayed true to the faith. Never mind expert reckoning that the Brexit vote was losing Britain £700m a week taking back control stirred feelings more ineffable than money.Andy Brooke in Derby had his own bespoke bike business when we first met him, full of hope for the future of his highly specialised service for serious contenders. His shop seemed the perfect spot, near where the council was building a velodrome. But the Brexit vote left uncertainty among his clients from Derby’s big companies. “Overnight, people became very, very careful with their money,” he said. Nationwide, bike sales went down. “Before the referendum, we’d been selling two bikes a week, but now it was down to two a month.” He went bust, his company filing for insolvency. Derby council’s velodrome suffered a similar fate: it made a heavy loss. “This has been a hard time for me,” said Brooke. “I got married and I was busy organising the wedding at the same time as I was dealing with the shop’s bankruptcy.” Looking back, he was rueful. “I was so uplifted by the 2012 Olympics. That showed us off as a great multicultural hub, welcoming everyone. Then came the referendum, so many political lies. Now the country’s creeping in the wrong direction.” So he is emigrating to the US, a young remainer despairing of Britain. “I’ve been offered something in sports science in the US. We want children, but we don’t want to bring them up here any more, not in this atmosphere.”Brexit was mainly caused by the partisan austerity created by the shrinking of the public sphere by Conservative governments. To win power, Johnson promised to repair his party’s depredations with eye-catching projects. His Brexit rhetoric has raised expectations, but his commitment to “levelling up” is a deceit unless it reverses all the financial and social forces that have been accelerating poverty since 2010.The lost decade was a Tory decade and perhaps the next one will be, too.

A horror fall in November 2018 sent her to hospital in an air ambulance with a laundry list of injuries and, while she was being treated, doctors discovered she was also suffering from cancer.Showing the toughness for which jump-racing folk are known, Loxton, born and raised on the Galway coast, is inclined to look for the positives. “If I hadn’t fallen off a horse, I would never have found out I had cancer.“I’ve had lots of treatment, I’ve had operations and I’m still going in every three weeks to have what they call a management drug. That goes on for another three or four months, I think. Fingers crossed, the doctors seem really happy.“It’s not something you can cure. It’s something you just keep under the thumb. I’m so busy with the horses, I hardly think about it.“It just seemed such a simple fall, but I kind of fell under the horse and then he tripped over me. I had a compound fracture of my right leg, a broken collar bone and a few ribs and I punctured my lung.“About a month after the accident, I still had my leg in a cast but I just had to get on a horse, to see if I could, so I rode around the roads. The children were furious.”The horse who did the damage, Earth Leader, is the least fancied of Loxton’s three intended runners next week. The others are Caid Du Berlais, to be ridden by the vastly experienced Will Biddick, and Shantou Flyer, whose owner-jockey, David Maxwell, would not claim to be as skilled as Biddick but has still been able to rack up 18 wins on his various horses this season.Maxwell switched Shantou Flyer to Loxton’s yard after the pair finished a fine second in last year’s Foxhunter, perhaps hoping a change of scenery would help the horse make up the necessary ground on Hazel Hill, who beat them last March. Loxton, who has had a winner at the Punchestown Festival in each of the last two years, is quietly upbeat.“I don’t want to be a tipster but if Shantou Flyer is well and fit, you’d think he’d have to have a serious chance. And Caid, if he can get up the hill, I’d love to see him placed.“It would be awesome to win, a dream come true. It’s the sort of thing you think about when you first get into racing. I mean, I can remember rushing home from school to watch the racing when I was young and thinking, gosh, it’s Cheltenham.”Nicholls, who is likely to run Alcala in the Foxhunter, says of Loxton: “She’s an amazing lady and you can see how the horses keep her going. She was here for a lot of years, she was head girl, and she still rides out when she can. She deserves all the success she gets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4833b5792abb7ec236386b8e3347b7621f90ef51/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a14fe47ea4452ded3904c78ed0c033af 1440w","title":"the last quiz night on earth review immersive pub drama","story":"Hope Mill theatre, ManchesterAn asteroid is hurtling towards Earth in Alison Carr’s new play, where everyone takes part in a pub quizThe local boozer might not be a bad place to wait for the impending apocalypse. At least, that’s the premise of Alison Carr’s new play, in which the end is nigh but the beer is still flowing.As an asteroid hurtles towards Earth, the punters of the Four Horsemen (get it?) are brandishing their pens for one final quiz night. Or rather, we are. In Box of Tricks’ immersive production, the audience are the pub regulars, dusting off our general knowledge and also competing for the title of best team name. In between quiz rounds, characters try to right old regrets and settle old scores as time ticks down to oblivion.There are some witty nuggets of dialogue in Carr’s script, delivered with easy charm by the cast of four. Meriel Scholfield’s Kathy, landlady of the Four Horsemen, holds everything together, always ready with a commiserating drink and a sharp reply. Our quizmaster for the night is Rav, loud and lovable as played by Shaban Dar, while Amy Drake and Chris Jack both make suitably dramatic entrances as unexpected blasts from the past.There’s a light touch to Hannah Tyrrell-Pinder’s direction and Katie Scott’s design, using small details to evoke the pub setting. Seated around tables, spectators quickly embrace the spirit of the event, scribbling down answers. The pedestrian familiarity of the set-up makes an enjoyably absurd contrast with the subject matter.But the blend of quiz and drama doesn’t quite do justice to either. The mixed format creates some awkward moments, as exchanges between the actors get lost under enthusiastic chatter. Squeezed in between rounds of questions and answers, the main content of the play is slight, playing on the predictable end-of-the-world themes of reunion, repentance and regret. Cliche is never far away.As a variation on your typical pub quiz, Box of Tricks’ production is an entertaining enough evening. But as an imagining of Armageddon, The Last Quiz Night on Earth brings little that’s new or surprising to an already well-rehearsed scenario."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e76f0ec1d761cf9a3f40c1408e30e481876029d0/94_85_3304_1983/master/3304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4c4bdec0e455d99b8d2eaa5ba5f83f6","title":"joanna lumley pays tribute to method acting forerunner ellen terry","story":"Absolutely Fabulous star shocked young people have never heard of ‘cavalier’ Victorian actorShe was a superstar in her day: mobbed by fans, paid a fortune and one of the finest stage performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries with a technique that was a forerunner to method acting. But mention the name Ellen Terry to young actors and they’ll look at you with a blank expression, Joanna Lumley has said.“Younger actors now don’t even know who Peter O’Toole is,” Lumley said. “I’m absolutely shocked. They literally don’t know who Christopher Lee is, they don’t know who some of the giants of our day are. I get so … I have to hush my mouth.“If you are interested in things you learn about them,” she said. Some people just “could not give a toss … it means nothing to them. A chunk of this magic party of life which we attend is lost to them. They’ve walked past because they are too stupid to open the door and have a look.”Lumley was speaking as the new patron of the Barn Theatre, a tiny but atmospheric theatre space created in 1929 at Terry’s country home, Smallhythe Place in Kent, by her daughter after her death.The house, looked after since 1939 by the National Trust, is a shrine to Terry with costumes and memorabilia from one of her most acclaimed roles going on display together for the first time from Wednesday.“You can almost see her standing there,” said Lumley, mesmerised by one of Terry’s stunning gold velvet costumes from the 1882 production of Much Ado About Nothing. “This is a living actress there, that could be Helen Mirren.”Terry was the leading actress of her generation, a star in the US as well as Britain. “She was talented, popular, a huge celebrity,” said Susannah Mayor, Smallhythe’s senior steward.“At the height of her career she was earning the equivalent of £24,000 a week, a huge amount for a woman at that time to earn.”Terry was successful because she was so naturally talented, said Mayor. “She was an instinctive, emotional actress … bringing a truth and depth long before method acting was recognised as a technique.”Lumley said Terry, according to her contemporaries, made Shakespeare alive and accessible. “This is a great gift. Quite often Shakespeare was taught to be declaimed and ‘tum-ti-tum’ but she managed to break through that. She spoke it I think in such a way that put the audience on the edge of their seat.”The three costumes going on display are from Henry Irving’s spectacularly lavish production of Much Ado at London’s Lyceum Theatre at which no expense was spared. As well as the actors there was an orchestra, choir, military band, organ and scores of perfectly costumed extras. The elaborate set for the play’s church wedding scene brought gasps from the audience.The costumes have gone through about a year of conservation and are being displayed alongside memorabilia from the show including Terry’s heavily annotated script and an original programme.Lumley has been a fan of Terry since she was eight. She recalled staying with friends in Tenterden, the nearest town, and being in a Pied Piper pageant as a rat or waif while her sister was a burgher’s wife and got her costume from a local lady – Maud Gibson, Terry’s dresser. “It is just extraordinary that I have had since I was eight this weird link.”Terry also had an interesting private life, married three times, had numerous affairs and was not married to the father of her three children. “I quite like her cavalier attitude to men,” said Lumley. “She was complicated in a way we are complicated in today’s world.”Lumley follows John Gielgud and Donald Sinden as patron of Barn Theatre, a space which plays host to around 30 productions a year. The 70 seat auditorium is always sold out.She was speaking at Smallhythe on Tuesday wearing a necklace she bought at auction which once belonged to Terry. After her it was worn and owned by Vivien Leigh and the opera singer Joan Sutherland.“And now I’m wearing it and at some stage when I get much older and grander I shall bestow it on another young actress and it will go on being passed down.”• Smallhythe Place reopens to the public after its winter closure on 4 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/910223acd5afa1fce50bb7f60231de7898caa97f/0_0_2517_1510/master/2517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70fa24ad7625963b200db9aee20561a6","title":"amazon struggles to halt tide of coronavirus profiteers","story":"The US company said it had removed “tens of thousands” of listings but analysts have likened the situation to a game of whack-a-mole with products reappearing soon after deletion.“There is no place for price gouging on Amazon,” the company said. “We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis and we have recently blocked or removed tens of thousands of offers.” Staff were monitoring listings around the clock, it added.With many products sold out or being rationed in stores, shoppers have turned to online retailers to order masks, hand sanitiser and even hazmat suits.

The £280 Monitor II ANC are no exception.The headphones fully enclose your ear with medium-sized cups, comfortable pads and a firm but evenly distributed grip on your head. The headband is lined with leatherette-covered foam and does a good job of staying put without too much pressure on your skull.Despite being Marshall’s largest headphones, the Monitor II are comparatively small and discreet with a relatively low profile on your head that’s very welcome. The ear cups are held by sturdy-feeling metal arms with a full range of articulation that slide in and out of the headband, clicking into place for a comfortable fit.They fold up in a number of different ways, making them some of the most compact and easy to pack full-size headphones for travelling.Marshall’s best-in-class control joystick returns. Press it in for pauseplay, up and down for volume, or left and right for track skip. Why others don’t copy this brilliant method of controls on headphones I have no idea.Two buttons on the back hinges of the ear cups take care of noise-cancelling modes and switching the equaliser between three user-selectable pre-sets. Press the noise-cancelling button to switch between active noise cancelling (ANC) and ambient sound modes or press and hold to turn it off.The headphones have a traditional 3.5mm socket and ship with a detachable cable that can be used with or without the power on.The Bluetooth connection to an iPhone 11 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and OnePlus 7 Pro 5G was strong and skip-free. But Marshall has taken a backward step, only supporting the most basic SBC Bluetooth audio codec.All Apple, Android and Windows devices support the improved AAC codec, while the latter pair also support aptX: a more advanced codec Marshall used in previous headphones. The better the Bluetooth audio codec, the higher the quality of audio. Thankfully, I saw no lip-sync problems with any of the common video-playing apps across Android, iOS and even YouTube in Microsoft’s Edge browser on Windows 10.Call quality was good. The recipient’s voice came through clear and loud in the headphones, while my voice was audible with a good amount of sidetone. The other end of the call said my voice was loud, clear and crisp, even if a little background noise seeped in intermittently.ANC uses inverse sound waves to cancel out unwanted noise before it hits your eardrum and has become bare minimum for high-end wireless headphones.By default, ANC is turned up to maximum on the headphones but you can turn it down in the Marshall app if you want more awareness of your surroundings. It works fine for cancelling out the rumble of an engine, and fairly well on road noise, but it is not very good at dealing with speech, meaning they are not the best for simply concentrating in an office or blocking out noisy commuters.The headphones also struggle to deal with wind noise, making listening to music in a gusty environment difficult. Turning off noise cancelling was the best option.Overall, Bose, B\u0026ampW and Sony have nothing to fear here, so if super-effective noise cancelling is your primary driver, best to look elsewhere.Marshall’s headphones have a particular sound that people love. Often they are best suited to rock, with a raw, grungy sound that’s exciting and full of energy. The Monitor II headphones also have that sound but are better at dealing with other genres of music, too, sounding almost as good with driving electronica or background lounge, while giving large orchestral scores a good go.The “Marshall sound” equaliser is active by default, which produces their best sound with an overall warm tone, fairly controlled bass and full-blooded mids, while highs are a little muted in places. The soundscape is surprisingly wide, giving a good immersive listening experience for big pieces, while there is a good amount of separation between instruments and tones keeping things clear when tracks get a bit intense.They do not quite rival the very best, such as B\u0026ampW’s PX7, but if you like Marshall’s warm, rock-focused sound, you will love the Monitor II.Battery life is so long you may forget you ever have to charge them. The Monitor II headphones are designed to last up to 30 hours with noise cancelling active and 45 hours with it off, which seemed a little conservative in my testing.That is easily enough to cover any flight or most weekly commutes without needing to charge. They take two hours to fully charge via USB-C but a 15-minute top-up will add about five hours playback if you do happen to forget to charge them.You cannot use the USB-C port for audio but you can charge them and listen to them at the same time.The headphones are not made from any recycled material but are made from responsibly sourced materials.The Marshall Monitor II ANC are a set of rocking headphones that look every bit the part.Despite being full-sized headphones, they are fairly slimline, with classic styling that sets them apart. They are robust, fold up to be much more compact than rivals and are far more comfortable than many – if you want to rock out for hours on end, they have the fit to make sure you can last as long as their 30 to 45-hour battery will.They have a sound that is slightly more refined than previous Marshall headphones, making them sound good for a wider range of genres, but the warm sound is still best with a trashing guitar packing plenty of punch and raw energy.They are not perfect, though. The active noise cancellation works for general drone but struggles with voices. They only support the standard SBC Bluetooth audio standard, not higher quality codecs practically every device is capable of using such as AAC or aptX, which is a backward step for the brand.They are certainly not cheap, and you can get a similar Marshall experience from the brand’s excellent Major III series of headphones for about half the price, but the Monitor II ANC are a warm, inviting listen that’s hard to put down.Pros: look great, fold down really compact, comfortable for very long listening sessions, long battery life, brilliant controls, great sound, decent noise cancelling, headphone socket, stable Bluetooth connectionCons: only SBC, expensive, noise cancelling struggles with wind and voices This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Continuing our look at European culture, we find Scandinavian TV’s new obsessions are go-getting young girls, wartime Royals – and the Swedish origins of Spotify • Poland’s world-beating new film-makers• How Greece’s theatre roared out of a national crisis• Are Berlin’s 56-hour party people facing their last dance?Before 2011, it seemed inconceivable that the British could be gripped in their living rooms by subtitled TV drama, night after fraught night. Surely that was the stuff of arthouse cinema, not edge-of-the-seat primetime viewing. Then along came a trilogy of Scandinavian exports – The Killing, Borgen, The Bridge – and what was once niche entertainment became a nationwide obsession.Soon, a single item of clothing was getting more attention in the British media than most series get in their entire life: Sarah Lund, the detective at the heart of The Killing, was as relentless in her wearing of Faroe Isle jumpers as she was in her pursuit of the murderer at large on the streets of Copenhagen. Scandi noir had arrived in Britain, and the connections it tapped into went much deeper than knitwear.According to Walter Iuzzolino, of Channel 4’s foreign-language, on-demand strand Walter Presents, these shows held up “a very interesting, distorted mirror” to the British soul. “Scandinavia has the same level of slightly gloomy, desaturated, rainy, cold, foggy, darkness,” he says. “But it also has beautiful aspirational interiors. This pared-back Scandinavian look triggers something. It’s almost us, but not quite us. It’s a version you like to spend time with because it’s tidy, it’s orderly.”But are we still spending as much time with our Scandi mirror-selves in 2020? It is true that lifestyle magazines have got over their craze for “hygge”, a term meaning anything cosy, cuddly or convivial and, yes, Ikea recently announced its first major UK store closure. However, Nordic noir still seems to be going from strength to strength. That 2011 invasion has now given way to a steady flow. If it’s harder to name the big breakthrough Scandi shows these days, that is only because there are so many more contenders.Sweden’s latest export is The Truth Will Out, a gripping detective drama based on the true story of one of the country’s most famous miscarriages of justice. In classic Nordic-noir style, it uses the fraught relationship between demoted murder detective Peter Wendel and his public prosector ex-wife to expose high-level governmental corruption. Already a smash hit in Sweden, The Truth Will Out has just appeared on Walter Presents.In terms of architecture, The Truth Will Out fully conforms to genre expectations, from the functional exteriors of looming government buildings to the cool uncluttered premises of flustered suspects. Indeed, architecture is so integral to the Scandinavian TV canon that two of that founding trio were named after spectacular structures: the five-mile Öresund Bridge that connects Copenhagen in Denmark to Malmö in Sweden and the Danish government’s Christiansborg Palace, known informally as Borgen. What’s more, there is always a blanket of snow on The Truth Will Out’s rural scenes, just as there is on otherwise disparate dramas such as Wisting (the Norwegian serial-killer series on BBC iPlayer), Fortitude (Sky Atlantic’s English-language Arctic homage to the genre) and Iceland’s Trapped (soon to air its third season).Still, people, not places, continue to define the best Scandi TV. “When it comes to Nordic noir,” says Mattias Bergqvist, chief TV critic of Swedish newspaper Expressen, “I’m convinced it all began with the Beck books by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, a wave of writing that continued with Henning Mankell’s Wallander and reached its peak with Stieg Larsson. That tradition of having well-evolved characters has been important.”It’s no coincidence, then, that the Danish producer behind the original screen adaptations of all these works, Søren Stærmose, is also the producer of The Truth Will Out, developed with Swedish crime writer Leif GW Persson. Stærmose credits his successes in part to the glimpses he provides of Scandinavia’s utopian – or apparently utopian – welfare society. “International audiences are curious about the cracks,” he says.Also, in possibly another echo with Britain, Sweden has long enjoyed an influence disproportionate to its size. “It’s a small country economically,” he says, “but internationally, it’s a humanitarian big power. And now you have the Greta Thunberg effect – showing no one is too small to make a difference.”The UK office of Yellow Bird, Stærmose’s production company, has just produced its first series for Netflix, Young Wallander, and it’s working on another, about the rise of Swedish music streaming giant Spotify. It is a typical example of how Scandinavia’s big public broadcasters – SVT, DR, NRK – are being joined by newer platforms and production houses, among them Swedish streamers Viaplay. And there is no shortage of international buyers, eager to follow a TV trend with proven staying power.As the Spotify project shows, the results are not all crime series either. State-of-a-generation dramas include Young and Promising (Norway’s answer to Girls) and the web series Skam (its answer to Skins), both of which have been very popular. Netflix cannily combined the two strands in Quicksand, a drama about a high-school shooting in an affluent Stockholm neighbourhood. Curiously, Scandinavian audiences typically like their period dramas British, but shows such as SVT’s Our Time Is Now and DR’s State of Happiness are changing that. The latter has been acquired by BBC Four.Even with bigger budgets, though, Scandinavia’s relatively small industry is stretched. “It takes time to get experience,” says Stærmose. “To manage big budgets, complicated long-term shoots, and work with wonderful, great egos.” His great success has lain in utilising this newfound spending power without losing the charm and craftsmanship of a cottage industry. Scandinavian drama has always had that enjoyable repertory theatre feel, with the same faces popping up again and again. Now the likes of Maria Sundbom (The Bridge, Quicksand, The Truth Will Out, Before We Die) and Søren Malling (The Killing, Borgen, Dicte, 1864, The Investigation) will be even busier. And there won’t be many complaints about that.This industry might not be the biggest, or even the best, in Europe – but what they do, they do to perfection, especially where those thrillers are concerned. “Scandi is unique in its ability to deliver a compellingly dark thriller,” says Iuzzolino. “They’ve mastered that art better than anywhere else in the world.”Even the most successful exponents of Nordic noir, however, do sometimes chafe against the constraints of the genre. “If you think about the original French meaning of the word noir,” says Stærmose, “you associate it with cheerless lightning. But our lighting is not cheerless!” His latest show, Thin Ice, is a climate crisis thriller set among the melting ice caps of east Greenland. “I’m trying to introduce the subgenre Nordic blue, to show the cheerful colours of our snow, ice and the sky above us.The Truth Will Out was the big talking point of 2018. This year, it is undoubtedly Caliphate, a thriller about Swedish Islamic terrorists. “It’s not perfect, but it’s a brave show taking on pressing questions,” says Karolina Fjellborg, TV critic of Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. She also recommends the dramedy Bonus Family and is not surprised by all of the appreciation of Scandinavian television. “As a Swede who grew up watching all kinds of TV with subtitles, I’ve never understood English-speaking peoples’ aversion to foreign-language shows. It was about time subtitles made a breakthrough.”Next year, meanwhile, perhaps the big show will be The Investigation, a drama about the real murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall aboard a mini-submarine in Copenhagen harbour. It is written and directed by Borgen’s Tobias Lindholm.Whether or not any of these shows will grip the UK, the international influence of Scandinavian TV is abundantly clear. In under a decade, these shows have created a global TV grammar, with seemingly every other talked-about show of the last few years boasting a Scandi feel. Black Mirror? Nordic. True Detective? Nordic with a Cajun twist. Succession? So, so Nordic. For a region famed for its tolerance and peaceful neutrality, Scandi TV has managed global domination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da9a6e0df0ce1a3c13f1466c0ee98d2d597a61bb/0_130_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c8a64be5f231b487606094e2581bc42","title":"new york school closes coronavirus","story":"Tensions over how to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus escalated Tuesday in the United States as the death toll climbed to nine and lawmakers expressed doubts about the government’s ability to ramp up testing fast enough to deal with the crisis.All of the deaths have occurred in Washington state, and most were residents of a nursing home in suburban Seattle. The surge is raising concerns about the dangers of the coronavirus to the elderly and immunocompromised. The number of cases in the US overall climbed past 100 scattered across at least 14 states, with 27 in Washington.Meanwhile, in New York state, a second coronavirus case has been confirmed in a 50-year-old man with an underlying respiratory illness. He is hospitalized in serious condition. According to state health officials, the man is an attorney who lives in Westchester county north of New York City and works in Manhattan.New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that the patient had not traveled to countries considered the epicenter of the outbreak but had visited Miami recently.The confirmed diagnosis marks the first apparent community-spread case regionally. Because the patient is not believed to have come into contact with other infected people, health officials said it raises concerns that the pathogen is spreading locally.“With the results confirmed within a number of hours, we were immediately able to take next steps to stop the spread of this virus,” said New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio. “We have said from the beginning that it is likely we will see more positive cases of the coronavirus.”The patient had primarily been with his family in Westchester. Health officials are testing friends, relatives and anyone who may have come in contact with him for risk.News of the second case spread as an Orthodox Jewish school in New York City canceled classes on Tuesday to allow for precautionary measures after a suspected case of coronavirus turned up within its community.Health officials cautioned, however, that a second confirmed case should not be a cause for alarm, reiterating that they had expected that the disease would be found in multiple locations around the state and that it would be likely to spread.“We want New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives, use the subway, take the bus, etc,” city health commissioner Dr Oxiris Barbot said, adding that the coronavirus “is not an illness that can be easily spread through casual contact”.Governor Cuomo disclosed the second case after the SAR Academy and high school, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx borough, said it was in touch with the city’s department of health and following its guidelines.New York had previously reported one confirmed case, in Manhattan, on Sunday. The 39-year-old woman had recently returned from visiting Iran – one of the virus’s global centers. Her husband is also undergoing tests and his results are expected to come back positive.The US surgeon general urged Americans to remain calm after about 100 coronavirus cases had been confirmed in 15 states, with New Hampshire and Georgia being the most recent. “We should be cautious and take appropriate measures to prepare and protect ourselves, but we should not be afraid,” the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, said. In a phone conference on Tuesday, the CDC confirmed 60 positive or presumed-positive cases of the coronavirus nationwide and expressed growing concerns for vulnerable populations throughout the US.“What is happening now in the US may be the beginning of what is happening abroad,” said Nancy Messonnier, director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in an opening statement.The director faced tough questioning from reporters over criticism of the department’s handling of the health crisis, including the initial limited availability of diagnostic test kits and strict qualifications for screening.Many critics say these measures may have contributed to the virus lying dormant in places like the Seattle suburbs for weeks. Reporters also pressed the director over the CDC’s cooperation with state and local health officials to provide updated infection numbers.While Messonnier noted that the department “of course will be aggregating data on a daily basis”, she also acknowledged the CDC’s numbers “may be a little delayed” because of the volume of “testing kits going out”.The CDC update came as the Wall Street Journal first reported that Trump administration officials are weighing using national disaster program dollars to fund hospital care for uninsured patients with the coronavirus.Under the National Disaster Medical System reimbursement program, the federal government reimburses hospitals and medical facilities by paying them higher rates than Medicare for treating at-risk patients.Dr Robert Kadlec, the US health department’s assistant secretary for preparedness and response, acknowledged discussion of the use of disaster funds in a hearing before the Senate committee on health, education, labor, and pensions on Tuesday.He added that, in a major pandemic, the US would need 3.5bn N95 respirator masks to fight the virus.“We have about 35 million,” he said.The World Health Organization has confirmed nearly 90,000 cases, the vast majority in China, and more than 3,000 deaths.Coronavirus, or Covid-19, is a respiratory illness with symptoms similar to flu and is thought to spread mainly via respiratory droplets among “close contacts” – such as coming directly into contact with the droplets or certain other bodily fluids.The virus can also be spread from being within about 6ft of a patient for a prolonged period, according to the CDC.It is characterized by fever and coughing and, in serious cases, shortness of breath or pneumonia. Most who contract it recover but it can develop into pneumonia-like symptoms, with the elderly and those with health problems at particular risk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f04f71ab337b591201b2f13081d856713b9410/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42699d153c2e22aa8791b1e9b1da7934","title":"super tuesday 2020 live news bernie sanders joe biden california texas primaries latest updates","story":"’s Maanvi Singh reports from San Francisco:The mood has been a bit confused here in San Francisco. At Manny’s – a local bar and gathering place - many patrons cheered as soon as it became clear that Bernie Sanders would win the state. But some Sanders supporters felt uneasy. “I’m a little bit disappointed and nervous,” said Delia Cleveland, 40. “I’d hoped he’d have a bigger lead.”Kyle Schmidt, 30, said he was feeling “all the emotions”. “I feel better about progressive politics than I’ve ever felt in my life,” he said. “We might actually win.”But Joe Biden’s wins didn’t feel good, he said. “It’s terrifying. I’d feel safe had Bernie dominated.”Joe Biden has taken a narrow lead in Texas, where 228 pledged delegates are up for grabs.Those numbers indicate the final result in Texas could be quite close, so Biden may not get much of a delegate advantage over Sanders from the state.On the other hand, California, the most delegate-rich state of the night, was immediately called for Sanders once polls closed, so he could have a significant delegate edge over Biden there.Here’s some non-presidential primary news: Jeff Sessions, Trump’s former attorney general, has advanced to a runoff for his old Senate seat in Alabama.Sessions represented Alabama in the Senate for 20 years, but he left his seat in 2017, when Trump nominated him to be attorney general.However, Trump soured on Sessions after he recused himself from the Russia investigation, clearing the way for the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Sessions is now fighting to get his old job back, but he will need to defeat Tuberville -- not to mention incumbent Democratic senator Doug Jones -- to do so.Congresswoman Ilhan Omar appeared to criticize Elizabeth Warren for not dropping out of the race as Joe Biden notched several victories in Super Tuesday states:Omar, one of the four progressive congresswomen known as “the Squad”, is a top surrogate for Bernie Sanders, and Warren will likely face increasing calls from his supporters to suspend her campaign after tonight.’s Lauren Gambino reports from Los Angeles:An ebullient Joe Biden bounded on stage in Los Angeles, accompanied by his wife, Jill, and his “little sister,” who he mixed up before quickly correcting himself. “It’s a good night and it seems to be getting better,” Biden said. “They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing.”At the start of his remarks, Biden ticked through all the states he’s won so far: Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Minnesota and “maybe even Massachusetts.” After he left the stage, the Associated Press declared Biden the winner in an upset over Elizabeth Warren. “Just a few days ago the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead. And then came South Carolina came around and they had something to say about it. And then when he got to Super Tuesday it’d be over. Well it may be over for the other guy.”“We are very much alive,” he declared.Biden thanked the former presidential candidates who endorsed him this week – Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke – but he did not mention any of his present rivals by name. “People are talking about a revolution,” he said, taking an implicit jab at Bernie Sanders, who entered Tuesday as the prohibitive frontrunner. “Well, we started a movement.”Protesters rushed the stage at Joe Biden’s event in Los Angeles, raising concerns about security for the leading presidential candidates.Two anti-dairy protesters, who have disrupted other candidates’ events in recent days, ran on to the stage and had to be dragged off by some of Biden’s staffers.Symone Sanders, one of Biden’s top aides, actually jumped from her seat to grab the second protester and pull her offstage.Sanders won praise on social media for her courage, and she joked about the incident over Twitter:But the incident raised questions about whether the top candidates like Biden and Bernie Sanders should start receiving Secret Service protection:Here’s how the AP was able to call the California primary so quickly for Bernie Sanders:News outlets conduct exit polls of voters to get a sense of which way a race is leaning.If those exit polls point to a decisive victory, the outlet may declare a winner right when the polls close. That’s what happened in South Carolina on Saturday, and we’ve seen it again tonight in states like Virginia and Vermont.The fact that the AP, the outlet of record for elections, was able to call California so quickly for Sanders indicates the Vermont senator will likely have a significant margin of victory in the delegate-rich state.Bernie Sanders’ victory in California marks an incredible comeback for the Vermont senator, who lost the state to Hillary Clinton in 2016.Clinton defeated Sanders in California by 7 points in 2016, giving her a 33-delegate advantage in the state.However, even that single-digit margin was better than Sanders’ team had initially expected. Early results showed Clinton easily defeating Sanders by double digits.Exit polls indicate Bernie Sanders has about a 15-point lead in California, the most delegate-rich state of the entire Democratic primary.If Sanders can maintain that lead, it will help him to counteract the post-South Carolina bounce that Joe Biden has clearly been enjoying tonight.However, it will be days if not weeks before we know Sanders’ exact margin of victory because California has a slow vote-reporting operation, due to its large size and high rates of early voting. The polls just closed in California, but the AP has already called the state for Bernie Sanders, giving the Vermont senator a much-needed boost tonight.Sanders had been favored to win in California, where 415 pledged delegates were up for grabs.The margin of Sanders’ victory in California will be crucial in helping him secure a delegate lead over Joe Biden, but his immediate win in the delegate-rich state will give him some positive press coverage on a night that seemed to be going very well for his rival.It is 11 pm ET, so the polls have officially closed in California, the biggest prize of the night.Bernie Sanders is still favored to win in California, where 415 pledged delegates are up for grabs.The Vermont senator may benefit from the fact that California has a robust early-voting operation, so Joe Biden may not see as much of a post-South Carolina bounce there as he has seen in other states tonight.’s David Smith reports from Charlotte, North Carolina:Democratic Congresswoman Alma Adams was celebrating at a watch party for Joe Biden supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, where each state victory was greeted with cheers.Asked why African American supporters back Biden so strongly, Adams said: “First of all, we know Joe. We know we share his vision. We trust him and that’s the thing. We know that he’s always been a Democrat so we don’t have to wonder about where he really is in terms of party affiliation and that kind of thing.“I think it’s a matter of trust and knowing that he has the skill set to do what we need for him to do. We trust him, we love him and so that’s why we vote for him.”Adams was critical of Bernie Sanders’ attempts to engage with the African American community. “He doesn’t have the same voice or vision for our folks. I don’t know how much work he’s done in the African American community but I’ll tell you, he’s been in my district twice that I know about and no one from his campaign ever called me.“He never called me and I am the congresswoman for this district. That’s certainly not a good look.” Joe Biden has won the primary in Massachusetts, the home state of Elizabeth Warren where Bernie Sanders was favored to win just days ago.Biden’s victory in Massachusetts underscores that his wins tonight have been far-reaching, extending from the south to the midwest and now the northeast.’s Mario Koran reports from San Diego:But in Southeast San Diego, a historically black part of the city, a steady stream of voters strolled into their polling place at the Malcolm X Library Tuesday afternoon. After a strong showing in South Carolina, observers have been watching to see if Joe Biden can capitalize on the victory and garner support of black voters. As I talked to voters trickling in to cast their ballots, however, no noticeable groundswell emerged in support of any of the candidates. Bakir, an area resident, said he wasn’t excited about any of the Democratic options.“At this point, it’s more about who you take out than who you put into the White House,” Bakir said, referring to Trump.Joel Pagan, 38, was still undecided. He considered Mike Bloomberg, but says he’s now thinking Biden. “I’m leaning toward Joe,” says Joel Pagan, 38. “I’m looking for the candidate who will do the most for the black community.”Bloomberg picked up a surprise endorsement from the area’s assemblywoman, Shirley Weber, a Democratic who’s pushed fiercely for accountability for police and schools.Despite the stop-and-frisk policies Bloomberg implemented as mayor of NYC — a record that’s been roundly criticized — Weber told the San Diego-Union Tribune that she was impressed with his “Greenwood Initiative,” a plan that would lead to a million black homeowners and 100,000 new black-owned businesses in the next 10 years. Trump’s reelection campaign released a statement saying the Super Tuesday results will create “more chaos” for Democrats. “The results only increase the likelihood that no candidate will have enough delegates for a first ballot victory at their convention, which only means more chaos!” said campaign manager Brad Parscale.The president’s campaign also sought to equate Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, even though the two differ on a number of key policy issues.Even if Bernie is not on November’s ballot, his big government socialist ideas will be because they have become mainstream in today’s Democrat Party,” Parscale said.’s Lois Beckett reports from Fresno, California:Erica Sanchez, 48, and her mother, Maria Sanchez, 68, both voted for Joe Biden today in Fresno, California, a erse city of half a million people in California’s Central Valley. Their vote for Biden was a vote for “normalcy,” Maria said. “He’s been there before,” Erica said. “He knows how to get the job done.”Maria and Erica, both themselves blunt talkers, said they like Biden’s frankness. They feel that they can trust him, that he has integrity. Many people in their family have served and are currently serving overseas in the US military, which they said is more than either Trump or his own children have done. Maria’s parents were Mexican immigrants, farmworkers. Erica said she also has Native American ancestry. The past three years, since Trump’s election, have brought a level of tension and ision to the United States that Erica said seems like worst the country has seen since the Civil War. They both want that to be over, and to have a president who can heal the country. Erica’s 24-year-old daughter is a Bernie Sanders supporter, but her two sons, who are both in their 20s, had been talking about following their grandmother’s lead, and voting for Biden, Erica said.Bernie Sanders has won the primary in Utah, where polls closed about half an hour ago.Joe Biden, who is so far the biggest winner of the night, is suprisingly in fourth place in Utah.Sanders similarly won the Utah caucuses in 2016, defeating Hillary Clinton by a resounding 60 points.However, Utah only has 29 pledged delegates, so his victory there won’t help him much. The biggest prizes of the night, California and Texas, have not yet been called."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4554229f9b050b9982900048fefcb939f5bc18b4/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57f2e01a17b5a57aa7e3dc8f5b63764f","title":"democratic primary 2020 latest delegate count","story":"Find out who is leading the race to become the Democratic nominee for the November electionBernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg are competing to become the Democratic nominee for the presidential election in November.The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and US territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee.

There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.While the inherently private nature of WhatsApp makes it hard to track the spread of such material or judge how many people are reading it, some of the posts seen by the  use the standard language of internet chain letters and urge people to forward the advice to friends and family – circumventing the official health communications in the same manner that has allowed anti-vaccination movements to flourish online.Prof David Harper, a former chief scientist at the Department of Health, said the UK’s established communications strategy for a public health crisis is to have a trusted medical figure rather than a politician deliver regular updates to the public.He said this approach worked well during the 2009 influenza pandemic: “It was decided early on that the designated person would be very visible even if there was very little to say. If no one is saying anything then it becomes a cause of concern. It’s much better to be visible and be seen by the public, even if it’s just to repeat what’s been said or say there’s not been much change.”It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.The coronavirus has spread to\u0026nbspmore than 60 other countries. The worst affected include South Korea with nearly 5,000 cases, and Iran, with over 1,500 cases.There have been\u0026nbsp40 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.Harper, now a fellow at Chatham House, said there is some risk that people become “desensitised” if they are provided with too much information on how many people have been infected without sufficient context, but that transparency improved public trust.A decade on this approach is being challenged by the radically changed media environment. Major social networks, aware of past criticism of their role in spreading untruths and hysteria over health issues, have moved to get ahead of the problem and are actively engaging with the UK government to provide information.Both Facebook and Twitter are promoting official NHS guidance, providing links to NHS advice in users’ feeds and when they search for coronavirus-related terms. Google, often the first port of call for health advice, is promoting official advice.The BBC, having spent recent months being attacked and stonewalled by the government, is emphasising its role in disseminating accurate, timely information about public health issues, with a spokesperson pushing the fact its coverage reaches millions of Britons with official guidance.“We know the public turns to the BBC at times like this,” said a spokesperson, pointing out that nine of the corporation’s 10 most-read stories online during the past week were about the virus. Also highlighted was the decision to make a special public information programme on the outbreak on Monday night.For a government that has put great weight on bypassing traditional media outlets, the outbreak has forced it to reconsider its relationship with the broadcaster. On Saturday a government minister was heard giving an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme for the first time since the general election, breaking a No 10-imposed boycott to deliver an update to the programmes’s millions of listeners. And on Tuesday health secretary Matt Hancock appeared on the same programme ahead of the publication of the government’s so-called ‘battleplan’ to combat the spread of the virus.Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said he still believed the government’s communications efforts were insufficient, and had been damaged by political boycotts of Today and ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “You are reliant on communications in these situations, and need every media outlet necessary. You certainly shouldn’t be boycotting programmes, frankly that’s pretty feeble,” he said.Kerslake added that not enough ministers had appeared in the media to support Hancock, who has been leading communications efforts on coronavirus almost single-handedly in the past few days. “No criticism of Hancock, but if I was him, I’d want a bit more back-up.”Harper, the former Whitehall official, accepted that Boris Johnson’s decision to call a meeting of the emergency planning committee Cobra may be partly for media consumption. But he said it also helps reassure the public about the seriousness of the issue: “In this case, the prime minister is seen to be in control. It is important that the machinery and the accountability for taking the decisions are seen. We have to be careful not to be too hung up on who’s doing what at what point.”Additional reporting by Elle Hunt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9487a3922f37b0dc58faecd047bf196b70e326d/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ea7d17fa05d770f1b84c9a306e078a9","title":"coronavirus 12 more test positive in uk bringing total to 51","story":"Eight had recently travelled from Italy and others from Germany, Japan and IranTwelve more people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number infected to 51.Eight of the new patients announced on Tuesday had recently travelled from Italy, and the fresh cases also included the first to have travelled from Germany. The others had been to Singapore, Japan and Iran, suggesting none are believed to have contracted the virus in the UK.Health officials in the Canary Islands reported the first case of a British national testing positive at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife.The 12 new UK cases constitute the second highest single-day increase in cases to date. They include the first known cases in Hampshire, Humberside and Northamptonshire. Others are from London, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Kent.Dr Will Welfare, of Public Health England North West, said there were three new Covid-19 cases in Greater Manchester, including two from Bury.“As a result of contact tracing we know the new Bury cases announced today are known contacts of the previously confirmed case from Bury,” he said. “The third case is a resident of Bolton which is not linked to the two cases in Bury announced today. The Bolton resident became infected whilst in Italy.“Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases. This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.”The previous case from Bury was said to have contracted the virus in Italy. Given that Public Health England (PHE) has said all the new cases were contracted after overseas travel rather than within the UK, the two latest cases from Bury are also likely to have travelled to Italy.Health officials in the Canary Islands said a woman who tested positive for coronavirus at a hotel in Tenerife on Monday is British and is now in hospital.The woman was one of 168 British tourists staying at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel when guests were placed in quarantine after Italian visitors who had recently stayed there tested positive for Covid-19.She is the sixth person at the hotel to test positive for coronavirus and the first Briton.

Under Israeli law, Netanyahu will have 28 days to do so or risk the process collapsing, leading to the unappealing possibility of a fourth election later this year.Regardless, Monday’s result – the best for Likud in all three elections – was a stunning turnaround for a man two weeks away from the start of a major criminal corruption trial. He is expected to appear in a Jerusalem court on 17 March on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three major cases.His main opponent, the retired general Benny Gantz and his Blue and White party, took 32 seats, partial results showed.Meanwhile, politicians representing the country’s sizeable Arab minority appeared to be set for significant gains, possibly their best ever performance. The Joint List alliance has been calling for people to vote for it as a protest against Netanyahu’s racist campaigns. Early counts showed the party had up to 15 seats, making it the third largest party in the Knesset by a clear margin. It has ruled out joining a government led by Netanyahu.In the early hours of Tuesday morning at a rowdy election party in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu told cheering crowds waving blue flags that his “victory” was sweeter than the first time he became prime minister in 1996 because it was harder.“We stood in front of strong forces. They told us we are going to lose, that it was the end of the Netanyahu era,” he said. “We turned lemons into lemonade.”Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian envoy to the UK, said Israeli voters had “rewarded hate, corruption and the promise to annex the occupied territories”, referring to Netanyahu’s recent promises to take more Palestinian land.Gantz had focused his campaign on Netanyahu’s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves. The strategy appears to have failed three times.At the Blue and White election party, the room soon emptied as rumours started to spread of a potentially disastrous result. “We are not beating around the bush and not telling ourselves stories: I share the sense of pain and of disappointment,” Gantz said.Authorities had even set up separate polling stations made of plastic sheeting for the more than 5,500 Israelis who were under precautionary home isolation after returning from areas of the world affected by coronavirus.Israel has been in an extended state of political crisis for almost 12 months after two previous general elections failed to produce a clear winner. To end the stalemate, Netanyahu had sought to energise his hardline nationalist base with promises of land grabs from Palestinians.A week ago, he announced he would go ahead with a highly controversial plan to build settlements east of Jerusalem. The plan would almost completely encircle Palestinian neighbourhoods in the holy city.Netanyahu made similar appeals before the previous votes. In April, he said he would annex all current settlements, and in September he promised to go further, by claiming sovereignty over a third of the entire West Bank.He has also looked to his rightwing global ally Donald Trump to help him convince Israelis that he is the only leader able to garner concessions from world powers.In late January, the US president appeared to give Netanyahu just that, revealing a “vision for peace” plan in the White House that read like a checklist of demands from the Israeli far right. The Palestinian leadership rejected the plan as flagrantly biased.Israel’s left-leaning Zionist parties, including the once dominant Labour, have largely lost support during the three elections.Fearing it might not garner enough votes to even pass the threshold to make it into the Knesset, Labour merged with the centrist Gesher party. It also made a deal with the anti-occupation Meretz party, which was itself accused of watering down its message by allying with less progressive politicians. The three-party alliance appeared to win just seven seats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbc8b6e6049d420c7bce1f344ea012fca586546/304_5_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d13e1f3bdecc492c01dee0fd166a3e47","title":"kim jong uns sister calls south korea a frightened dog","story":"Kim Yo-jong likens South Korea to ‘frightened dog barking’ after Seoul protested against Pyongyang’s live-fire military frillThe sister of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has condemned South Korea as a “frightened dog barking” after Seoul protested against a live-fire military exercise by the North.Kim Yo-jong’s comments – her first known official statement – came after Seoul’s security ministers expressed “strong concern” over Pyongyang’s firing of two short-range ballistic missiles on Monday – its first weapons test for more than three months.In the statement published by state media on Tuesday, Kim Yo-jong said the North was entitled to carry out military drills and dismissed the South’s condemnation as a “truly senseless act”.“Such incoherent assertion and actions … only magnify our distrust, hatred and scorn for the South side as a whole,” she added.Kim has long been one of her brother’s closest advisers and has frequently been pictured alongside him. She acted as her brother’s envoy to the South during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in 2018, which ushered in a rapid diplomatic rapprochement on the ided peninsula.Kim did not mention South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in – whom she met several times – but described Seoul’s presidential office, the Blue House, as “a burnt child dreading fire”.The publication of a political statement in her own name highlights her central role in the regime, analysts said.“By having someone like Kim Yo-jong – who has been a dovish figure towards the South and acting as a soft and friendly messenger – issue such a strong statement condemning the current government, the North is raising its pressure,” said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.Kim was named in January as a first vice-department director of the central committee of the ruling Workers’ party, but the new statement signalled she may have moved further up the hierarchy, he added.Earlier on Tuesday, North Korean state media published pictures of Kim Jong-un supervising what it called a “long-range artillery” exercise.Monday’s drills came days after the one-year anniversary of the failed Hanoi summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, and followed the expiry of an end-of-year deadline Pyongyang set Washington to offer it fresh concessions.The two countries are deadlocked over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return, and there are no significant contacts between the North and South.Kim Jong-un has declared the North no longer considered itself bound by its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, and threatened to demonstrate a “new strategic weapon” soon.Seoul and Washington last week postponed forthcoming joint military exercises over the coronavirus outbreak – the South has more than 5,000 infections – and the South’s president, Moon, offered to cooperate over the disease with the North, which has closed its borders to try to prevent a potentially devastating outbreak.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dcdbcca2ea7afa9a802f0fbceb5d1b0454d096/712_575_2719_1632/master/2719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953fefdb54c8081454605e8ff904ebc8","title":"now we dont have to be afraid syrian family turkey","story":"Turkish border with Syria remains closed to most but some have escaped horrors of Idlib In a video shot by her father, three-year-old Salwa listens intently to the rumble of military hardware in the distance. “Is it a plane or a shell?” he asks as they sit together on the sofa. “Shell!” she shouts, giggling hysterically when it explodes.Turning the sounds of airstrikes and shelling into a game is how Abdullah Mohammed, 32, protected his daughter from the trauma of Syria’s war. Last week the family made it to the safety of Antakya, just over the Turkish border. Dancing around her new home in a pink princess dress, for the first time in her life Salwa doesn’t have to listen to the sounds of the conflict.Abdullah is giddy with relief. “Now we don’t have to be afraid any more,” he said. “Salwa has a completely different future.”The family were very lucky to be invited to Turkey rather than having to pay smugglers thousands of dollars and then dodge the bullets of border guards. There are 3 million other people still trapped by a three-month-old campaign by the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian allies to seize back north-western Idlib province, the last opposition stronghold in the country.Russian airpower has emptied towns and villages of civilians and fighters, allowing the Syrian army and allied Iranian-backed militias to surge forwards and capture swathes of territory.While Damascus and Moscow say they are targeting jihadist factions not covered by a 2018 deescalation deal, the UN says the aerial bombardment and shelling has killed more than 130 civilians in February alone, with dozens of hospitals and schools hit. More than 900,000 people have left their homes, most of them fleeing north to the relative safety of the Turkish border, in what is now the worst humanitarian crisis of the nine-year-old war to date.The threat of a potential new influx of millions of refugees led Turkey, which supports some of the rebel groups, to beef up its presence in Idlib, sending thousands of troops and convoys of equipment in an attempt to repel the regime advance.That in turn led to an escalation in tensions between Ankara and Moscow after at least 33 Turkish troops were killed in an airstrike last Thursday. While Turkey, a Nato member, officially blamed the Syrian regime for the attack, sources on the ground suggest the strike was actually carried out by the Russian air force.Since then the Turks have vented their fury on Assad’s forces, destroying dozens of tanks, howitzers and air defence systems in what has been in effect a declaration of war on the regime. On Tuesday, Turkish F-16s roared over the hilly Bab al-Hawa border crossing into Idlib, where they took down a fourth Syrian jet.The intense fighting is likely to get worse over the next few days as the parties scramble for maximum leverage before talks on Thursday between the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.“Turkish drones, artillery and surface-to-surface missiles have pushed the regime back,” said Omar Saad, a fighter with the Turkish-backed National Front group. “It’s the first time ever I’ve seen Assad soldiers being hunted by aerial strikes the way they kill civilians. It’s justice. And every warplane downed means civilian lives are saved.”Otherwise, the Turkish side of the border zone is deceptively quiet. Stray dogs sleep beneath blossoming apricot trees and sheep roam the hillside. Shops in the border town of Reyhanlı have put up Turkish flags in solidarity with the operation.Bab al-Hawa has seen a steady stream of military vehicles and aid trucks, as well as a quick show of support from the US special representative to Syria, James Jeffrey, and the US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, during a visit to the Atmeh displacement camp on Tuesday.The traffic is almost entirely one way: Turks go in but few Syrians are allowed to come out, usually those with pre-existing travel permits for medical care. The sprawling misery of Atmeh on the other side of the wire may as well be a million miles away.The situation is the opposite of the scene unfolding on the other side of the country, at Turkey’s borders with the EU. Following the strike on Turkish troops, Ankara declared it would no longer stop migrants from trying to cross into Europe – a move designed to pressure western allies to support the Turkish campaign in Idilb.Since then the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimates at least 13,000 people have travelled west to try their luck. One Syrian baby drowned after a boat capsized while trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos, and one man from Aleppo died after being shot in the throat with a rubber bullet allegedly fired by Greek border guards.That the new crisis on the fringes of the EU is manufactured is made all the more apparent by the fact that Turkey’s southern border with Syria remains shut.Abdulnaser al-Desh, stuck in Atmeh camp, does not have the money – $3,000 per person – that smugglers demand to get his wife and three children to Turkey.“We heard that Turkey is going to open the border with Idlib but it’s still closed. They just opened the European side,” he said. “We are being used as bargaining chips. It is humiliating to be treated like a disease which no one wants.”Salwa’s father, Abdullah, says he feels guilty his family managed to escape while so many in Syria are still suffering. “I feel bad to leave my siblings and Salwa’s cousins and grandfather behind. At the same time though, it is not too much to ask for a life where you are treated like a human being. I can take Salwa to the park every day. She is so much happier already.”Salwa clambers on to his lap as he talks in the living room of a friend’s house where the family are staying for now, and she demands to be picked up and tickled. Neither of them can stop laughing.

Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.The coronavirus has spread to more than 60 other countries. The worst affected include South Korea with nearly 5,000 cases, and Iran, with over 1,500 cases.There have been 40 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8af99e61af63e4c4199e0cb9f79cda50fdd60e12/0_81_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e273b9c8a8c8a7480264ddf58754ae05","title":"the best thing about wellington mittens the cat has paws all over new zealand capital","story":"Turkish Angora roams tattoo parlours, office towers and churches, posing for social media snapshots along the wayA feline that roams New Zealand’s capital city and is welcomed into tattoo parlours, hairdressers and office towers has become a social media star, with 30,000 followers who track his every movement online.Mittens first came to attention in 2018 after repeatedly wandering inner-city dwellings, including the university, the post office, and a Catholic church. Mittens was also reportedly taken to the police station by concerned locals.After repeated encounters with Mittens, an SPCA employee started a Facebook page to reassure locals that the cat wasn’t lost and didn’t need to be “rescued” – he was just adventurous.The Facebook page now has 30,000 followers with locals tracking Mittens’ daily activities around town.The page, The Wondrous Adventures of Mittens, also lists a series of rules for interacting with him, including “do not tell Mittens to go home”, “no speculating or asking where Mittens is”, and “no discussing Mittens being picked up”.Mittens also has a Wikipedia page, where his occupation is listed as petlocal celebritymedia personality.A selfie with Mittens has become a bucket-list item for many Wellingtonians. Owner Silvio Bruinsma says Mittens had similar venturesome habits when they lived together in Auckland but Wellington’s compact inner city has now made him much easier to track.Mittens’ brother Latte, also a Turkish angora, does not share the intrepid streak and rarely ventures more than 20m from home, while Mittens can roam up to 2km.“He has made Wellington his playground,” Bruinsma told the Dominion Post.“I suppose my philosophy is, he doesn’t like being locked up and I don’t want to give him a life that is miserable.”Although there was some initial concern for Mittens’ apparently aimless wanderings (no one feeds him but Bruinsma), locals and visitors now actively go looking for the cat and say he shows caution around roads – reportedly even stopping to wait at traffic lights.In one close encounter, detailed in February on the Facebook page, Mittens got stuck in a $2 shop after falling asleep. A combined effort by Facebook members led to him being tracked to his last known location and the owners of the store were contacted to let him out after hours.Sam Thacker, one of the administrators of the Facebook group and a staff member at the SPCA, has known Mittens for years and describes him as “street smart”.“Please don’t pick him up and bring him into the SPCA,” Thacker posted.“He has come in too many times with well meaning people. All this means is that his owner has to come and collect him off us! We have had him in with us recently and he is perfectly healthy.”According to pictures posted online in the last week, Mittens has visited a real estate agent, a Latino salsa bar, a community law centre and Victoria university."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/745359f1446afb7ff4ee446366c741c0065267ff/0_167_4020_2412/master/4020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=389b88573ce584f337f87773f2904ec9","title":"women work for free for two months a year says tuc analysis","story":"Women work an average of 63 unpaid days because of the gender pay gap, according to figuresWomen work for free for two months a year as a result of the gender pay gap, according to analysis by the TUC. The trade union federation marked Wednesday as the first day of the year that the average woman effectively begins to get paid.“Our economy is stacked against working women. At this rate, it will take another 50 years to close the gender pay gap,” said the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady. “No more excuses: the government must get on and sort the gender pay gap now.”In professional, scientific and technical jobs, the average woman waits 88 days with her women’s pay day coming on 28 March 2020.The widest gender pay gap is in finance and insurance. Female employees wait for more than a third of the year before pay kicks in on 3 May 2020.The analysis also showed significant regional gender pay differences, linked to the concentration of industries in different regions.Companies with more than 250 employees have been forced to publish their gender pay gap since changes to the Equality Act came into force on 6 April 2017. Previous filings have revealed that almost eight out of 10 British companies pay men more than women.Critics have also warned that inaccurate figures and a lack of sanctions risk making a mockery of the gender pay gap reporting system.  analysis of submissions revealed that mathematically impossible gender pay gap data filed by companies in 2018 had remained uncorrected while the Equality and Human Rights Commission admitted that no companies had been fined for failing to comply with legislation.The TUC has argued that the government should force companies to carry out equal pay audits, produce action plans to close the pay gap in their workplace, and fine companies that fail to comply with the law instantly.“Just publishing gender pay gaps isn’t enough. Companies must be required to explain what steps they’ll take to close their gender pay gaps – and bosses who don’t comply with the law should be fined,” said O’Grady.She said employers should do more to help women balance family responsibilities and work and called for flexible working to be a right for everyone at work from day one.Ahead of the TUC’s annual women’s conference in London, which begins today, she added: “Every year unions help thousands of women get the pay they deserve. And workplaces that recognise unions are more likely to have family-friendly policies and fair pay. That’s why every woman should be in a union.”A Government Equalities Office spokesperson said: “We want to see everyone given the same opportunities at work. This means we want to see employers encouraging shared parental leave, flexible working and other measures which put people in the best place to succeed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4191913.1583264801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus mary lou mcdonald attends hse meeting at shut down school","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris during a media briefing  on the coronavirus in Government Buildings on Tuesday. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsA helpline should be set up for families whose children attend the Dublin school currently shut due to coronavirus, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald has told a meeting of parents at the school.Ms McDonald, who has publicly stated this week her children attend the school, was one of hundreds of parents who attended an information meeting hosted by the HSE on Monday night.The meeting, held at a venue away from the school, was conducted in a question-and-answer format, with the initial correspondence sent out to parents read at the gathering.Those addressing the meeting on behalf of the HSE included director of public health east Dr Deirdre Mulholland and professor of bacteriology at NUI Galway Martin Cormican.Ms McDonald spoke at the meeting to ask questions, including about how easy it was to pass on the virus during the incubation period. No commitment was given on her suggestion that a helpline be set up specifically to deal with queries from the families of the children at the school.A number of people present claimed they had received contradictory information from the HSE’s coronavirus helpline, according to people present.One person said when he initially asked should he hold a large family celebration that he had planned, he was advised against it, but when he called back again he was advised he could go ahead with his plans.Less-experienced staffIn reply, the meeting was told that because the HSE was dealing with an emergency situation, some less-experienced staff had been drafted in to work on the helpline at short notice because more experienced personnel were not available.The meeting was informed that while the virus was soft-coated, meaning it could only survive on surfaces for a matter of hours, the school would be deep-cleaned before it reopened.One parent said he had had his child tested and he had shown a negative result, with others querying why all the children at the school were not tested.However, Prof Cormican said if the test was carried out too early it would not detect the condition, and he explained only people who were showing suspected symptoms would be tested. Other people at the meeting asked questions about how vulnerable some of their relatives, who had serious health conditions, were to contracting the virus.Meanwhile, a youth group in Dublin has been asked to “self-isolate” for two weeks by the HSE to prevent the possible spread of coronavirus.The group is linked to the case of coronavirus at the school.A letter the HSE sent on Monday to parents of children who are members of the group said a case of coronavirus had been identified in a person who attended a two-hour meeting of the group last weekend.“As a result, to prevent the possible spread of infection, all members... are being treated as possible contacts of the case, and asked to self-isolate until Sunday March 15th,” it said.While the children in the school have been told by the HSE they should not travel abroad for a fortnight, there were questions about whether the parents could travel as several had foreign trips booked.The meeting was told the HSE intended to tell Irish airlines that the children who had been told not to travel should not leave the country.One parent who spoke to The  in recent days said he had a trip planned with a family group that included children from the school who had been told not to go abroad.However, he said Ryanair had informed them because there were no confirmed cases of the virus in his family they were free to travel.

Photograph: The  The Government is not advising “at this stage” that St Patrick’s Day parades should be cancelled because of the coronavirus threat, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Speaking at a press briefing in Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon, he said the Government expected the coronavirus Covid-19 to spread and it was likely to change its approach as further cases emerged.Asked about St Patrick’s Day parades, Mr Varadkar said there was only one confirmed case of the virus in the State “so we’re not advising anyone to cancel any gatherings at this stage.“But bear in mind that the St Patrick’s Day festival is two weeks away and a lot can happen between now and then.”He added: “There will be new advice published later today or tomorrow.”Minister for Health Simon Harris said the Government was talking to public health experts and virologists on a “daily and often on an hourly basis” and taking their lead.He was speaking following a briefing at the Cabinet about the efforts to tackle the virus and to prepare for its potential spread.As businesses in Ireland continued to deal with the threat, Google said its staff at Barrow Street in Dublin were being asked to work from home for a second day as a precautionary measure after an employee reported flu-like symptoms.Google told most of its 8,000 Irish staff and contractors to work from home on Tuesday, and it said this policy would continue on Wednesday.The number of Irish people tested for coronavirus more than trebled over the past week, a period that saw the Republic record its first confirmed case and a massive surge in cases worldwide.Almost 400 people have been tested for the virus since the current outbreak started in January, public health officials said on Tuesday, compared to 90 this time last week.All but two of the tests, one involving a woman who travelled from northern Italy and the other\u0026nbspinvolving a school student from Dublin, came back negative.The increase is mainly due to a widening of the number of areas of the world subject to coronavirus-related travel advice.GP contactsPreviously, the Department of Foreign Affairs’s travel advice was confined to travellers from China, but it now encompasses other areas, including Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, and four regions in Italy where restrictions have been imposed.Anyone coming back from these areas and who feels unwell is being advised to contact their GP and may require testing. Italy, the European country worst affected by coronavirus, has exported cases to many other countries, including Ireland.Speaking before the second case in the east of Ireland had been confirmed, Mr Varadkar said: “The situation is still evolving. This is a new virus and a virus that we don’t know everything about yet. So advice and actions and policy may change as we know more. But there is a moderate to high risk of more cases.“A small percentage of those people may get very sick. But...\u0026nbspsome of the actions that you see in other countries are not necessary in Ireland at this stage.”The Taoiseach said: “What we’re pursuing in Ireland at the moment is a policy of containment, making sure that any cases that are identified are contact-traced and we contain any potential outbreak.“But we may come to stage in a few weeks time if that’s not successful where we move to mitigation phase, and that would be treating the ill, rather than trying to contain the virus but we’re not at that stage yet.”Mr Varadkar said that most briefing would be done by the chief medical officer and other doctors, rather than politicians.Public adviceHe added the advice the Government was giving to people was simple – wash your hands, cough and sneeze into a sleeve or tissue and people who had been in an affected region who developed symptoms should contact their GP and “self-isolate”.Minister for Health Simon Harris said experts – “the best brains in the world” – were continuing to learn about the virus. He said any decisions made by the government would be guided by public health and by science – “not by politics”.There was some confusion on Tuesday morning when the Department of Health initially denied it had advised members of a Dublin youth group to “self-isolate” before retracting that denial. On Monday, the HSE sent a letter to parents of children who are members of the group saying a case of coronavirus had been identified in a person who attended a two-hour meeting of the group last weekend.The group is linked to the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the Republic.Asked about the department’s initial denial in a now-deleted tweet, Mr Harris said: “People acted in good faith in responding to what was a very dynamic situation. . . People are working flat out, they’re working seven days a week . . . and people are answering questions in good faith and on this occasion that good faith turned out not to be true.“But what’s most important to the public is the clarification that measures have been taken on a precautionary basis,” he said.Reiterating public health advice, Mr Varadkar said people should wash their hands for 20 seconds – “that’s roughly long enough to sing happy birthday twice”. Further information was on the HSE website hse.ie, he said.St Patrick’s DayEarlier, a leading international virologist and expert on influenza\u0026nbspsaid the Government should cancel St Patrick’s Day parades to avoid the spread of the coronavirus.Prof John Oxford said Chinese authorities cancelled the Chinese New Year celebrations and Ireland should take this opportunity to stop the spread of the virus.“Like in northern Italy, they sat there for weeks thinking they didn’t have a case, everything was fine, suddenly there was an explosion - they’re the new epicentre now.“I heard this morning that Italians are now importing the virus back into China, into areas where they’ve not had it before.”Prof Oxford said St Patrick’s Day parades are held all around the country, not just in Dublin. “Every little place has a parade, on top of that you’re getting lots of visitors in from abroad, from all over the place.“I would take advantage of the situation you’re in, so that you could prevent a big out break, by taking these actions, I would go ahead and stop the parades.”He added that this is “a very fruitful opportunity for the virus to get a grip on your country and start spreading.”Prof Oxford also said he did not support plans for the Cheltenham racing festival to go ahead.New MeasuresNew measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 are also likely to be announced following a meeting on Tuesday of the National Public Health Emergency Team, which will be considering fresh advice from the European Centre for Disease Control.The emergency team will also bring forward recommendations on limiting mass gatherings due to public health concerns over the virus, which may impinge on St Patrick’s Festival and other upcoming public events. It is also likely to recommend the transfer of testing of suspected cases from hospital emergency departments to the community.Ryanair has decided to cut flights for three weeks from the middle of this month as the virus outbreak hits bookings.The airline has told passengers it would cut its short-haul flight programme, mainly to and from Italy, by up to 25 per cent from March 17th to April 8th.It blamed a “significant drop in the bookings over that late Marchearly April period, in response to the Covid-19 virus” for its decision and said a significant number of passengers were not showing up for flights, particularly those to and from Italy.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4191983.1583271158!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second case of coronavirus is confirmed in east of ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer with the Department of Health said ‘as things stand’ he saw no reason why the St Patrick’s Day festival could not go ahead later this month. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsA second case of the coronavirus has been confirmed in the east of Ireland.The case is a female whose infection is unrelated to the first case which was confirmed last Sunday involving a school student from Dublin.The latest case is associated with travel from Italy and the patient is receiving appropriate care, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said.The positive test result emerged on Tuesday evening, after the NPHET held a five-hour meeting to review measures, and efforts to trace contacts of the woman have just begun.Members of the team briefed media on the latest case on Tuesday evening.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan described the case as “not unexpected” but said Ireland remained in a containment phase and had yet to experience local transmission, as was the case in other EU states.All non-essential travel to four regions in Italy - Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont - is now being advised against.The Department of Foreign Affairs’ previous advice against non-essential travel in Italy was previously limited to 11 specific towns in the region.Guidance on mass gatherings is to be publishing in the coming days, following cross-Government review, Dr Holohan said.But he added that “as things stand”, he saw no reason why the St Patrick’s Day Festival could not go ahead later this month.The testing of suspected cases is also to be moved from hospitals to the community, most likely people’s homes.Dr Holohan said this would take further pressure off hospitals and that the tests would be carried out by paramedics.Issues relating to vulnerable people, healthcare workers, medicines supply and the preparedness of hospitals are to be examined by four separate sub-committees, the NPHET also announced.The measure being taken to counter the spread of the virus do have wider societal implications, he acknowledged, and these would be addressed by the Cabinet committee that has been established.A total of 397 people have been tested for the virus since the current outbreak started in January, public health officials said on Tuesday, compared to 90 this time last week. The female who travelled to northern Italy and the Dublin school student are the only two tests to come back positive.The increase in tests is mainly due to a widening of the number of areas of the world subject to coronavirus-related travel advice.Previously, the Department of Foreign Affairs’s travel advice was confined to travellers from China, but it now encompasses other areas, including Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, and the four regions in Italy where restrictions have been imposed.Anyone coming back from these areas and who feels unwell is being advised to contact their GP and may require testing.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA new State strategy to manage coastal erosion which Ministers hope will outline where extra protections need to be put in place is being examined by the Government. The Cabinet on Tuesday considered a memo on recent flooding across the country, as well as “managing climate risks to Ireland’s changing coast”.Kevin “Boxer” Moran, the Minister of State for the Office of Public Works and Flood Relief, attended the meeting. The memo said a new coastal strategy would be scoped out over a six-month period following a presentation made by Mr Moran to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure last December. Mr Moran said he hoped the new strategy would follow the model of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment programme, which outlined a long-term approach for the reduction and management of flood risk in Ireland. He hoped the coastal strategy would map out the places around Ireland that were at risk from coastal erosion – which he said would be “as big a problem as flooding” – and show where extra investment and protections were needed.The memo to Cabinet said: “A high level inter-departmental group on managing coastal change, to be jointly chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the OPW, is to initially scope out, over a six- month period, an approach for the development of an integrated, whole-of-government coastal strategy for managing our changing coast, including the governance structures.” MinistersMr Moran lost his Longford-Westmeath Dáil seat in the general election, and is currently one of a number of Ministers continuing their jobs while they are not TDs. All Ministers remain in place, even if they are not TDs, until a new government is formed. A number of Independent TDs are currently talking to political parties about forming a new government, and Mr Moran said some of those had mentioned to him that he should be a Taoiseach nominee to the Seanad. A new taoiseach can directly appoint 11 members of the Seanad, but Mr Moran said any such nominations were solely a matter for the next taoiseach.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4191957.1583267922!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu and uk could agree device to extend talks says ex official","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid O’Sullivan’s last official posting was as EU ambassador to the US from 2014-2019. File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe EU and UK could agree a “device” to extend the transition period if talks fail to secure a trade deal by the July 1st deadline, a former European Commission secretary-general has said.David O’Sullivan, an Irish former EU director-general in charge of trade who brokered the bloc’s trade with South Korea, said the UK government could drop its objection to the extension of the transition period from the end of the year if it could be sold politically at home. This could then “buy” both sides “more time to continue the discussions” to resolve issues where agreement has not agreed and avoid another potential “cliff-edge” no-deal scenario on December 31st, Mr O’Sullivan told The .British prime minister Boris Johnson has threatened to walk away from Brexit trade talks if negotiations have failed to make progress by June and to focus instead on preparations for the UK’s hard exit from EU economic rules on World Trade Organization terms at the end of the year. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, both the EU and UK must agree to extend the transition period by July 1st, though the UK government has legislated to prevent this scenario happening.Mr O’Sullivan said that he did not think it possible to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement in the nine-month period available and said that an extension of the transition period could be agreed, “which would not be called an extension”.“As a former negotiator I could imagine such a device being possible if both sides felt it worked for them,” he said.“Obviously it would require the UK to feel they could sell this as not being an extension of the transition phase, but I could imagine that it would have benefits for both sides potentially if it is not possible to solve everything or even to solve most things by the end of the year.”The retired Irish civil servant said he was most worried the EU-UK trade talks, which began on Monday, were not starting from “a position of mutual trust and confidence” in the wake of reports saying that the UK were trying to “get around” the ratified Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. “It is very unhelpful. As Irish people, of course we feel particularly aggrieved by that kind of language,” he said.“Stepping back from the emotions of our nationality, I think the rest of the EU will look at this and say, ‘but wait a minute we have a legal document, legally binding by both sides, ratified and suddenly we are told one side is actively considering how to wriggle out of it.’”‘Unprecedented’Mr O’Sullivan, whose last official posting was as EU ambassador to the US from 2014-2019, described the EU-UK trade talks as “unprecedented” in that the two sides were moving from a position of total free trade to less free trade.The negotiations were “sort of free trade in reverse” as the discussions were uniquely aimed at finding agreement on the degree of ergence rather than convergence, said Mr O’Sullivan. “Typically, in a situation of free trade negotiations, you are talking about two parties who are relatively far apart or have distance between them and you are trying to narrow that distance and you are trying to converge,” he said. “Here we have perfect convergence which we are trying to turn into imperfect ergence.” Mr O’Sullivan will be speaking at an event hosted by the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin and Trinity College’s “Hist” debating society on Wednesday alongside former commission president Romano Prodi, and former European Council president and Belgian prime minister Herman Van Rompuy.

Photographs: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPA \u0026 Tom HonanThe Talks between Sinn Féin and Fine Gael are likely after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he had written to Sinn Féin offering talks and its party leader Mary Lou McDonald said she had replied and wanted to speak to everyone.Mr Varadkar reiterated his view that it was the responsibility of the opposition parties to form a government but said he was willing to speak to all parties, though he continued to insist that Fine Gael will not enter any government with Sinn Féin.Speaking to journalists after the Cabinet meeting at Government Buildings, Mr Varadkar said: “A government can be formed by the opposition parties, whether it’s Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin coming together or a Fianna Fáil-led government or a Sinn Féin-led government without us.”He said he did not have a mandate from his parliamentary party to get involved in talks on forming a government at this stage, something Mr Varadkar has not sought from his TDs.However, Mr Varadkar said Fine Gael is willing to talk to any party, and that has already happened with Fianna Fáil and the Greens. He said he had written to Sinn Féin last week offering to meet the party, but had received no reply yet.Ms McDonald responded by saying she has a letter drafted to send to Mr Varadkar but events of the last 48 hours – which saw Ms McDonald’s children’s school close due to concerns over the coronavirus – caught her by surprise.“I can assure the acting Taoiseach over the airwaves that letter is on its way to him,” she said on RTÉ’s Drivetime. She said she wants to ““speak to everyone” about how to bring about change in health and housing.“I want to talk to everyone about those matters, including Leo Varadkar,” she said.Unworthy of officeHowever she criticised the Taoiseach for a weekend newspaper article which accused Sinn Féin of not fully recognising the legitimacy of the State and for alleged financial irregularities.She said the “nature of the tone of his public utterances in a Sunday newspaper” were “unworthy of the office of Taoiseach”.She claimed his article was “most regrettable and needs to be corrected”.Talks between the parties continued at Leinster House on Tuesday but they are likely to continue without any conclusion at least until Easter, Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall has said, following talks with Sinn Féin.Asked how long the current round of talks could take, she told reporters the “the likelihood is that we’re talking about sometime around Easter”.“I mean, it is early days yet,” she said, pointing to the 74 days it took to form a government in 2016, “so we are still in the early phases of that”.“We’ll just have to wait and see what evolves,” she added.Both women said the talks would continue on Thursday, while Social Democrats are due to have a full-day session with the Green Party on Wednesday.Ms Shortall and Ms Murphy reiterated the party’s position that they would not enter government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, but would consider serving in government with one of the two parties and Sinn Féin.Fine Gael is due to meet Fianna Fáil again tomorrow for an exchange on policy, but Mr Varadkar stressed that it would not be negotiations on a programme for government. He declined to speculate on the timeframe for government formation, but sources in all parties at Leinster House now expect that it will be Easter and probably beyond before the shape of the next administration begins to firm up.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4190840.1583184618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit negotiating teams convene for round one of trade talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief Brexit negotiators Michel Barnier (right) with David Frost at the start of post-Brexit trade talks. Photograph: APNegotiating teams for Britain and the European Union met for the first round of talks on the future relationship between the bloc and its former member in Brussels on Monday.Chief negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost held a roundtable meeting together with their teams of dozens of negotiators, opening the first of five rounds of talks due to take place by May that will alternate between Brussels and London.On Tuesday and Wednesday, the talks will ide into 11 groups that will run concurrently, focusing on areas including trade in goods, services and the contested so-called level playing field.Britain hopes to achieve a free-trade deal with the European Union that allows it trade easily with the world’s largest economic bloc. But the EU holds that easy access to its single market can come only with close alignment to its rules and standards, as otherwise UK companies would have an unfair advantage over those of the EU – something that London has ruled out.Other sticking points include fishing rights: an economically puny but politically weighty issue, particularly for countries such as Denmark and France. Britain wants to preserve more of the catch in its territorial waters for its own fishing industry, ending the practice of shared fishing waters, but it relies on EU markets to sell much of its fish.The first round of talks will conclude on Thursday with a meeting of all groups and a bilateral meeting between Barnier and Frost, at which they will take stock of progress made so far.Britain has left the EU and is now in a transitional arrangement, continuing to observe the same norms as before until the end of this year. If no deal can be reached, Britain will begin automatically trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation default terms in January.Brinkmanship politics?Both sides have said they are willing to walk away without a deal, even though this would entail economic damage, particularly for Britain and its closest neighbours including Ireland. Britain has said it will prepare for a no-deal scenario if it judges that insufficient progress has been made by June.But whether or not a deal is struck, Britain has made clear that its ambitions are for a more distant relationship with the EU, even if that comes at an economic price.EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has urged companies to prepare for this by reactivating no-deal Brexit contingency plans.“I am very concerned that there’s not sufficient planning in place presently,” said Hogan. “The last thing we want to see is a logistical nightmare for our exporters at our ports and airports through not being properly prepared.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

There could have been no more fitting spot for a final stand.The billionaire has already given up on winning California, the largest US state. But in Texas, the second biggest, he still has a fighting chance.We really need Texas to get the job done. The road to victory starts right here, right now, he told supporters in an old air force hangar in San Antonio. You\u0027ve all heard the slogan: \u0027Mike will get it done.\u0027 If you haven\u0027t … I’ve wasted an awful lot of money. Mr Bloomberg, 78, the world\u0027s ninth richest man, targeted Texas from the start of his unorthodox campaign (see video below), visiting seven times and carpet-bombing the state\u0027s airwaves. Appearing on stage to U2\u0027s Beautiful Day, he refrained from attacking, or even naming, any of his Democrat rivals, focusing instead on US President Donald Trump.He said: We have a leadership vacuum in the White House. There is a really serious crisis facing our country, and our world, and that is the coronavirus. President Trump buried his head in the sand.This is not a job for an amateur, and he is. Trump\u0027s incompetence really puts us at risk. He\u0027s the definition of ‘all hat and no cattle’. I\u0027m all action and no BS.The former New York mayor went on to describe himself as the un-Trump and vowed to send Donald back to Mar-a-Lago permanently.Addressing his own widely criticised debate performances, Mr Bloomberg said: You could see in the debates I\u0027m not someone who just yells slogans when they\u0027re not true. We need a leader ready to be commander-in-chief, not college-debater-in-chief. I believe we need less talk, less ision, less tweeting. How about no tweeting from the Oval Office ever again?In Texas, it is impossible to turn on a TV without seeing Mr Bloomberg. Some 80 per cent of presidential campaign advertisements are his. Across large swathes of the Lone Star State, he is the only candidate on air.One Spanish-language advertisement, repeated endlessly, cost $4.3 million. It says Mr Bloomberg has la fuerza para enfrentar a Trump - the strength to face Trump. A third of Texas voters are Hiic.The resulting poll numbers have been reasonably encouraging for Mr Bloomberg, placing him in an effective tie for second place with Joe Biden but trailing Bernie Sanders. However, experts say those numbers could be soft - meaning people like what they see in the advertisements but won\u0027t get round to voting.Mr Bloomberg\u0027s campaign points out that he also has by far the biggest ground game in Texas, with 19 field offices and 180 staff, many more than Mr Sanders. The candidate says he has also eaten a lot of Texas brisket while meeting voters.But when it comes to drawing crowds, there is no comparison with Mr Sanders, who previously barnstormed the state, including packing out a rodeo arena.By contrast, barely a few hundred people turned up at to see Mr Bloomberg. It was less than the number that tried to defend the Alamo.But I\u0027m still putting all my eggs in one basket because I believe this guy can beat Trump. I like Bernie and Biden, but we need to go with someone who has a chance.Mike Mullen, 72, a Vietnam veteran, said: I used to be a Republican but Trump\u0027s ruining the country. I came here to take a look, and Mike\u0027s got my vote. He’ll do better than people think.Mr Bloomberg\u0027s juggernaut of a campaign has been built by the very best data and advertising experts. His field organisers are being paid $6,000 a month, more than the average family income in Texas. He has spent an estimated $528 million on advertising alone.The top-down structure of the campaign is the opposite of Mr Sanders\u0027 organic movement.However, it appeals to those with a yearning, not for excitement and revolution but for competence and stability.In San Antonio, it was a serious, cerebral crowd. There were no baseball hats and, despite it being Texas, not a single Stetson. No one chants or dances wildly at a Bloomberg rally. If they feel the Bloom, they do so quietly.But they do go home satisfied that they have seen a man who knows what he is doing and what he is talking about.There was a similar reaction when Mr Bloomberg appeared last week at a Women for Mike rally in Virginia, where he is also polling well. The event was a response to allegations that he had made derogatory comments to women working at his media company, which he has denied.The middle-class audience, many dressed in “I Like Mike” T-shirts, snacked on chocolate croissants and fruit skewers in a hotel ballroom 10 miles from the White House.I think he actually is charismatic, but he\u0027s just not used to debating on TV, said Roberta Russell, 76, an author who brought along her champion poodle, Lexis Cathexus. He’s a fine man. He\u0027s highly educated and he’s reached a stage in life where all he wants to do is give. That\u0027s very admirable.Julianne Fanning, in her 50s and retired from working at the World Bank, volunteered to knock on doors. She said: We’ve lost credibility abroad. We need an honest broker in the White House.For Mr Bloomberg, the question is whether his appeal to voters\u0027 heads, rather than their hearts, can succeed. On Super Tuesday on March 3, where 14 states will cast their votes to nominate, he will find out whether competence and stability is enough of a draw.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"carrie gracie nearing end road bbc","story":"The BBC will “rightly die” unless it gets its pay issues under control, Carrie Gracie has said, as she suggested that her own career with the corporation is coming to an end.Gracie fought and won a high-profile battle with the BBC for equal pay after discovering that she was significantly underpaid as China editor in comparison to the US editor, Jon Sopel.The BBC apologised to Gracie and gave her £361,000 in back pay, which she donated to the Fawcett Society.

The Prime Minister described the virus as a national challenge ... something that our country has to get through. The document detailed plans to help businesses threatened by the growing crisis and said that the Army was on standby to get involved in the crisis. The plan drew comparisons between coronavirus and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and revealed that the Government was working on a worst-case scenario of 500,000 deaths, with up to 80 per cent of the country becoming infected.The 28-page action plan stated that any major outbreak could be just the first of multiple waves to hit the country. The Prime Minister said the Government was committed to doing everything possible in order to limit the damage the virus could wreak on Britain, warning that it was now highly likely that it would continue to spread.The Government’s advisers said that if the outbreak became impossible to contain, they would expect it to take six to eight weeks to reach its peak.The worst pressures would likely be seen in April or May, while the fallout from an outbreak or pandemic could continue until August.The Government plan was based on estimates that the virus could infect up to 80 per cent of people, in a worst-case scenario. It suggested that at the peak of a crisis, this could mean one in five workers are off sick at the same time.Officials said they anticipated overall death rates of around 1 per cent, compared with death rates of around 0.026 per cent seen during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.But they were fearful of far higher death rates among the elderly, with research showing coronavirus has mortality rates of almost 15 per cent among those over the age of 80.The plan set out sweeping measures - including the use of police to maintain public order, and only fulfilling critical functions - that may be taken if a major outbreak or pandemic occurs.With a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order, said the document. It said the Army could be used to take over duties at protected locations such as nuclear sites, Parliament and Downing Street if police forces became understaffed due to illness.The Armed Forces were on standby to help fill gaps in vital public services if the pressures on them became significant and clearly noticeable.Meanwhile, border forces would be given police-style powers to detain people at borders if they were showing symptoms of the virus and refused to be tested.The action plan also pledged to ensure dignified treatment of all affected, including those who die. The document said the Government was ready to combat a severe prolonged pandemic as experienced in 1918 when Spanish flu killed up to 50 million people worldwide.Advisers said the profile of coronavirus was very different: far less severe for children and young people, but most deadly in the elderly. Care homes were advised to go into lockdown in the event of a major coronavirus outbreak, with visitors banned and sick patients confined to their bedrooms rather than being taken automatically to hospital.The guidance seen by The  came as health chiefs urged relatives not to go and visit your auntie in a care home” if they were suffering from a cold or flu-like symptoms. The plan spelled out the four phases - contain, delay, research and mitigate - behind the Government strategy.During the delay phase, which would be triggered when it became clear that it was no longer possible to contain the spread of the virus, actions could include school closures, encouraging greater home working, and reducing the number of large-scale gatherings.Yesterday, ministers repeatedly stressed that this stage had not yet been reached. Advisers warned that taking these steps at the wrong time risked creating an awful lot of disruption and could mean that people were unlikely to heed such advice when it became critical.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said sick leave rules could be changed to allow people to sign themselves off work for two weeks in order to self-isolate. Mr Hancock told MPs the issue was under review, given that the current situation means a person must give their employer a doctor\u0027s note if they have been ill for more than seven days.Meanwhile, health chiefs in the Canary Islands confirmed the sixth person to test positive at the Tenerife hotel hit by coronavirus was a British woman who had been mixing with other guests for more than a week.A spokeswoman for the regional health authority admitted the unnamed Briton had not been confined to her room for most of her week-long stay at the four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"governments coronavirus action plan detail","story":"Boris Johnson set out his battle plan for tackling the coronavirus yesterday, promising that the Government will take all necessary and reasonable steps to beat it.The Prime Minister said he had no doubt at all that the UK is going to get through coronavirus and get through it in good shape.The 28-page coronavirus action plan outlines what the Government will do as and when it moves from the current strategy of containing the virus to the next stage: delaying its worst effects and then mitigating the problems when it peaks.Government health advisers suggested it is likely to take six months for the virus to run its course once it becomes impossible to contain, meaning it will be mid-August at the earliest before the outbreak is over.There is also the possibility of multiple waves of the virus if people are not immune to catching it more than once.The delay phase will kick in once health experts have advised that it is no longer possible to prevent widespread infections simply by isolating those known to have caught it.In the battle plan, and during a press conference yesterday, the Prime Minister and his senior health advisers set out how the NHS, police and other sectors would cope in the worst-case scenario, as outlined below.Soldiers will take over guard duties at protected locations such as nuclear sites, Parliament and Downing Street from the police officers who normally patrol them. Border Force officers will also be given police-style powers to detain people at borders if they are showing symptoms of the virus and refuse to be tested.And in the worst-case scenario, where workplaces could have up to a fifth of their staff off sick, understaffed police forces will be able to investigate only the most serious crimes.The Government’s coronavirus action plan also promised to ensure dignity for anyone who dies from contracting the virus, but it shied away from discussing the specifics for disposing of what could ultimately be hundreds of thousands of deaths in a worst-case scenario.Referring to staff shortages among police officers, the document said police and fire services will concentrate on fulfilling critical functions, adding: For example, with a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order.It also stated that the Ministry of Defence will provide support to civil authorities if requested.Government sources insisted that the Armed Forces would only take over guard duties at the most sensitive of sites. Unless you live near those sites, you wouldn’t be seeing the Army out on the streets, said one source.However, it is unclear whether soldiers could also be asked to take over patrol duties at mainline railway stations and other places usually covered by the police.NHS hospitals will be told to postpone anything postponable in the event of a major outbreak of coronavirus, England\u0027s Chief Medical Officer has warned.Routine operations would be cancelled, other treatments rationed and patients sent home from hospital early in a bid to free up beds for high-priority cases, according to the Government\u0027s coronavirus action plan. Health chiefs have declared the highest state of NHS emergency, ramping up efforts to cope with the crisis. All intensive care units have been ordered to carry out urgent checks on their patients amid concerns some could already be infected with the virus and at risk of spreading it among the most vulnerable.  A letter to NHS trust chief executives, seen by The , said that if the outbreak were to spread, all wards could be used to treat sufferers. The letter, from Professor Keith Willett, NHS Strategic Incident Director, stated: “It is essential that we detect cases admitted to intensive care at the earliest opportunity.” Until now, every patient with suspected coronavirus has been tested and treated in isolation. But, the letter warned, if the outbreak continued, every acute unit in the hospital would have be prepared to take such cases and make efforts to keep them away from other patients. The Government\u0027s coronavirus action plan said that if that were to occur, it would move to the mitigation phase of its strategy, which could mean significant and clearly noticeable pressures on services. Officials suggested this could mean routine NHS services being stopped for several weeks around the peak of an outbreak, which could start in six to eight weeks. Government sources said it could mean more than 50,000 operations being put on hold. Professor Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said that the NHS will be prepared to slow down or postpone anything that is postponable if it is facing a major surge in demand. The coronavirus action plan said: As NHS staff start to become affected, and more seriously ill patients require admission, clinicians may recommend a significantly different approach to admissions. Some non-urgent care may be delayed to prioritise and triage service delivery.It also stated that more will be done to support early discharge from hospital to free up as many beds as possible.Meanwhile, Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, said the UK was expecting a significant increase in cases next month.The best guess is then a period of six to eight weeks of quite significant levels of transmission in the UK, with a tapering perhaps in July and August - so an upsurge in April, possible peak in MayJune and a downturn later in the year, he said.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said ministers were considering turning to private hospitals for extra bed capacity in the event of a major outbreak. He said it would be all hands to the pump in the NHS, with retired doctors and nurses, and volunteers, brought in to support healthcare services.While the action plan suggested around a fifth of workers across the UK could fall sick at any one time, the fear among officials was that the figure in the NHS could be far higher, given staff members\u0027 likely exposure to the virus. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said the public could play its part by thinking about what we can to do to avoid too much pressure on the NHS when it comes to using services such as GPs and 111. He said: It will be quite important to be self-restraining where possible.  Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said the crisis in the UK could last as long as six months, from the point that sustained person-to-person transmission is confirmed. So far the UK has seen 51 cases. Sir Patrick said: “You can think of it as roughly two to three months from an outbreak of sustained person-to-person transmission up to the peak - and two to three months after the peak to decline again is the timeline we would be thinking of.” But Prof Whitty suggested the biggest changes to the running of the NHS - such as  postponing operations - would likely last a number of weeks rather than months. More than six million people could end up off work when the coronavirus peaks, the Government has warned, in a major blow to businesses and the wider economy.The worst case scenario would take one-fifth of all employees out of the workforce, leaving a gaping hole in Britain\u0027s output as crucial workers are stuck at home or in hospital.Companies have been offered limited help to delay big tax bills, while workers may end up relying on the benefits system – particularly if they are self-employed.Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, has said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) would be on hand to support companies to make sure they get through the short-term difficulties and make sure they have the protections they need. He added: We are taking each step as it comes.However, the help on offer to businesses facing slumping sales or a shortage of workers is limited, according to the coronavirus action plan.For businesses facing short-term cash flow issues (for example, as the result of subdued demand), an effective mitigation already exists in HMRC\u0027s Time To Pay system. This is offered on a case-by-case basis if a firm or inidual contacts HMRC about falling behind on their tax, the document says.This scheme lets companies pay the previous year\u0027s tax bill in instalments over time rather than in one go.Children\u0027s exams face being thrown into chaos if the coronavirus outbreak forces the Government to close schools.There are fears that any closures could coincide with the start of the GCSE and A-level exam season in May.The Government’s 28-page coronavirus action plan stated that, if the virus becomes established in the UK, action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies such as school closures … to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population”.It added: The UK governments\u0027 education departments\u0027 planning assumptions include the possibility of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection.Ministers emphasised closures would be a last resort, but parents and teachers expressed anxiety on social media about the prospect of pupils\u0027 education being interrupted.Martin Clee, a science teacher from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, added on Twitter: If Covid-19 goes big and mass school closures happened, say towards the end of Maybeginning of June, what happens to exam season?At least 10 schools are currently closed for deep cleaning following the return of either staff or pupils from one of the countries where the virus has taken hold. Around 19 more have only just reopened.Official advice was not to close schools but to isolate inidual pupils or teachers suspected to have contracted the virus before calling Public Health England.But there have been complaints about conflicting advice. Parents said they have been left confused by some schools sending pupils home to self-isolate while others shut altogether.The latest to shut was Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, which closed temporarily on Tuesday after a parent of a pupil tested positive for the virus. A deep-clean of the school will take place before it reopens.Some pupils at the school had recently returned from a skiing holiday to northern Italy, but headteacher Mark Bellamy said the case was not linked to the trip. In a letter to parents, he wrote: “Last week, I chose to keep the school open following advice from the Government and Public Health England.Today, as I believe this confirmed case directly impacts on my students and staff, I am closing the school.Whitehall sources said efforts were currently being focused on replacing teachers who had fallen ill by allowing colleagues from other schools to take their place or enabling children to travel to other schools.The Government could also relax class sizes beyond the maximum of 30 allowed in primary schools, allowing schools where one or more teacher is sick to send children elsewhere.Ministers are anxious to avoid widespread closures not only because it would disrupt children’s education but because it would place a wider strain on the workforce, with working parents forced to stay at home to look after their children.Government influenza pandemic preparedness strategies warned that school closures would place a significant pressure on health workers, handicapping their ability to come into work at a time when they are most needed.Teaching unions also expressed concerns over the prospect of an increase in class sizes, warning it could even make the risk of infection worse.Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: A cramped classroom will not keep pupils safe, potentially doing more harm than good, and arguably work directly against the \u0027social distancing\u0027 recommended in the action plan. It will not provide peace of mind for parents.Care homes have been advised to go into lockdown in the event of a major coronavirus outbreak, with visitors banned and sick patients confined to their bedrooms.Providers across the country have been issued with new guidance to prevent the virus from spreading among vulnerable and elderly residents, and health chiefs urged relatives not to go and visit your auntie in a care home if suffering from a cold or flu-like symptoms.At least two care homes in Britain have temporarily shut over concerns that residents may have come into contact with a confirmed coronavirus case. Death rates have shown that Covid-19 poses a far greater danger to the elderly and those suffering underlying health problems. Care homes are also feared to be at heightened risk because of the close living conditions.Professor Chris Whitty, the Government\u0027s chief medical officer, has said officials are keen not to take stringent measures, such as banning visitors from care homes at which no cases have been identified, too early because of the social cost involved.However, guidance issued by the Care Provider Alliance, the industry body representing adult social care providers in England, describes how care homes should go into effective lockdown if a resident is diagnosed with coronavirus.The Coronavirus Infection and Prevention Toolkit document says patients should be kept in their bedrooms rather than automatically being sent to hospital. If it is not possible to isolate people – for example, those who need dementia support or other specialist needs – symptomatic iniduals should be cared for in an area that can be separated from those who are unaffected, it adds.The guidance also advises care providers to consider restricting visits from all relatives until the outbreak is over and refuse to admit any new clients. It may be necessary to contact regular visitors and ask them not to visit the care setting during the outbreak of infection, it says.Care providers are also told to restrict the use of new agency staff in the event of a coronavirus case to lessen exposure to the disease.If this is unavoidable, block-book staff during the outbreak to limit the numbers of inidual agency staff potentially affected, the advice adds.  If staff are taken ill as a result of being exposed to the infection, you should follow national and local guidance on how to prevent the spread of the infection.Wales\u0027 chief medical officer, Dr Frank Atherton said: If you think about the most vulnerable populations, they are often in nursing homes or care homes. I think we need to intensify the advice to people that, if you have a cold or flu-like illness, don\u0027t go and visit your auntie in a care home.In the US, an outbreak of coronavirus in a nursing home near Seattle has left one resident dead and four others in hospital, three of them in critical condition. Of the home\u0027s 108 residents and 180 staff members, more than 50 have shown signs of possible Covid-19 infections, officials said.The Government\u0027s chief scientific and medical advisers have told holidaymakers to go abroad wherever they want – as long as they make sure their destination has decent healthcare.The advice follows the cancellation of hundreds of flights by airlines, with tourists and business travellers either scrapping travel plans or refusing to commit to bookings. Coronavirus has hit the airline industry particularly hard, with the value of the world\u0027s biggest airlines plunging by billions of pounds. Consumer groups warned that families who have booked to go on Easter holidays have been left confused in the wake of the outbreak, unsure over whether their trips are covered by insurance, whether it is safe to travel and whether flights will be cancelled anyway.One airline expert warned that the cost of some flights could rise, with routes scrapped to match dwindling demand.The chief advisers on the virus moved to clear up confusion over international travel at a news conference unveiling the Government\u0027s coronavirus action plan.Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, said that the risks of travelling on holiday or for business are no greater than staying in the UK as soon as Covid-19 becomes widespread.Once the epidemic is everywhere, then actually restricting travel makes no difference at all, he said. At the moment we are certainly not recommending any change to behaviours in relation to that. If it grows in the UK, then of course it doesn\u0027t really make more sense to say that you\u0027re at more risk somewhere else than you are here.Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, advised people against travel to countries with a weaker health system than the NHS and suggested they choose a location based on the quality of treatment that would be available.If you happen to be in a place with a very weak health service at the peak of their epidemic, weaker than the NHS, that obviously might be more problematic – and this is particularly an issue for people who are older or have pre-existing health conditions, Prof Whitty said.The Coronavirus action plan says Foreign Office travel advice provides the necessary information for British nationals ... on what they need to know before deciding whether to travel and what to do if they are affected by an outbreak of Covid-19 while travelling.On Monday, both British Airways and Ryanair announced flight cuts, with BA dropping 432 flights between March 16 and March 28, and Ryanair cutting a quarter of flights to and from Italy between March 17 and April 8.But at a meeting of airline executives in Brussels on Monday, bosses warned of further economic damage to come. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, said there had been  a very significant fall-off in demand in Europe, especially in Italy, but predicted that it would stabilise in the coming weeks following a pattern seen in Asia.Emma Wiseman, a spokeswoman for flight comparison website Skyscanner, said a study of the cost of flights to 10 destinations from the UK for both February and June showed prices fluctuating with no obvious link to the virus spread.But Ms Wiseman warned of rises on routes where flights had been cut, including London to New York – which has seen flights in June rise by an average of 10 per cent. It\u0027s too early to say if recent events are likely to drive any permanent changes to flight pricing, she added.Martyn James, of consumer complaints service Resolver, said more customers were cancelling holidays because of illness or fears over coronavirus. He said customer complaints to travel firms using terms like flu had more than doubled in February compared to the same period last year.Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: While the decision to cancel flights in the face of growing concerns around the spread of coronavirus may be understandable, passengers due to travel will want to know what this means for their plans, especially in the run-up to the Easter holidays.Given the circumstances, airlines should also consider offering flexibility to customers who don\u0027t want to travel, such as allowing refunds and waiving flight change fees for both existing and future bookings.The Government\u0027s action plan for dealing with coronavirus raises the prospect of major sporting and cultural events being cancelled in an attempt to stem the spread of the disease.The 28-page plan says population distancing strategies intended to reduce the risk of the virus spreading further could be implemented if the situation becomes worse.This may include reducing the number of large scale gatherings, raising the prospect that events such as the London Marathon, the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, football matches and music and arts festivals could be postponed.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said on Tuesday that it was far too early to be able to tell whether the London Marathon would need to be cancelled, but did not rule it out if the virus became more widespread. The race is scheduled to take place in eight weeks, with one million spectators set to line the route. London Marathon Events said it was monitoring developments closely.At the same time, European football\u0027s governing body, UEFA, announced emergency working groups involving the Premier League and other governing bodies to cope with a potential fixture pile-up if matches are cancelled.The Premier League, Football Association and English Football League have discussed a worst-case scenario option of games being played behind closed doors if coronavirus spreads.Contingency options have been discussed by officials in the past week in case the Government orders a major shutdown of mass gatherings, as has been seen in Switzerland and France. It is understood the Premier League would consider playing matches in front of empty stands if it allowed the season to be completed.Inidual sports stars are increasingly likely to find themselves caught up in the crisis as the disease gains hold in the UK.England prop Mako Vunipola will miss the rest of the Six Nations after going into self-isolation over coronavirus fears, it emerged on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the England team said Vunipola had withdrawn from the squad after management discovered he had stopped over in Hong Kong, where there have been around 100 cases, on a flight back from Tonga at the weekend.A severe worsening of the coronavirus outbreak could also raise the prospect of the Grand National being cancelled. Thousands are set to flock to Aintree in April to watch the world\u0027s most famous horse race.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford college investigates feminist lecturer barred womens","story":"An Oxford college has launched an investigation into a no platforming row, after a female historian was barred from a feminist event. Exeter College hosted an event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ruskin College\u0027s inaugural Women\u0027s Liberation Conference. Prof Selina Todd, an expert in the history of working-class women, had helped to organise the summit by enlisting the support of Oxford\u0027s history faculty, which provided facilitators and funding. She had been due to speak at the event, which took place on Saturday, but the evening before she was told that her invitation had been rescinded. The academic has been accused of being a transphobe for her involvement in women\u0027s rights advocacy and for her teaching of feminist history. Her research suggests women who posed as men in the past were often lesbians seeking to protect themselves or did so because they wanted to do jobs that were only available to men.Earlier this year, it emerged that she had been given security guards to accompany her to lectures after receiving threats from transgender activistsProf Todd, who was uninvited from the conference after other speakers threatened to withdraw if her speech went ahead, said she was shocked at her treatment.The row deepened when Prof John Watts, the chairman of Oxford\u0027s history faculty, also withdrew from the event in solidarity with Prof Todd. Now Exeter College has launched an investigation into the no platforming of Prof Todd, after a formal complaint was submitted by the journalist Toby Young on behalf of the Free Speech Union. Mr Young set up the organisation earlier this year as a way to counter censorship of lawful views. In a letter to Prof Sir Rick Trainor, the Rector of Exeter College, Mr Young pointed out that this was a clear breach of the college\u0027s own code of practice, which says all events held on college premises must ensure free speech is upheld. He also said it was in breach of its legal duty to uphold free speech. As far as I am aware, no one connected with the College made an effort to ensure Prof Todd\u0027s freedom of speech was protected, said Mr Young. The decision by the organisers to no-platform Prof Todd ... was particularly egregious given that she had helped get the conference put on.He added that when fellow speakers threatened to withdraw, the event\u0027s organisers should have told them that they would not be bullied into dropping Prof Todd. Sir Edward Leigh, the Tory MP for Gainsborough, has also written to the universities minister asking her to investigate. An Exeter College spokesman said it has received a complaint about the event which will be reviewed in accordance with our complaints and appeals procedures. Oxford\u0027s history faculty said it had been pleased to support the event, but added that it withdrew its support when Prof Todd\u0027s invitation to speak was rescinded. We cannot accept the exclusion of our respected colleague Prof Selina Todd from the event, and that means that we withdrew from the weekend’s celebration, a spokesman said. As an academic department, we simply cannot condone the no-platforming of people who hold and express lawful views. We believe it is always better to debate than to exclude: this seems to us a key principle of 1970, and we are sorry that the weekend\u0027s event took a different path.”An Exeter College spokesman said that it played no role in decisions about the event\u0027s programme or speakers. Exeter College is committed to the open and respectful discussion of ideas and to providing a supportive and inclusive environment in which the rights and dignity of all its staff and students are respected and valued, and in which people can work and study, without fear of discrimination or harassment, they added. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/03/TELEMMGLPICT000226725121_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"super tuesday 2020 live voting updates latest results bernie2","story":"Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will battle it out for the Democratic nominationBiden proves his strength with black voters in southern statesSanders leading California in early projections Bloomberg makes his last stand in Texas as he braces for a bad night Polls closed in California, the biggest prize of the nightWhich candidates are left in the race?Joe Biden had a strong start to \u0027Super Tuesday\u0027 with victories in key southern states, while Bernie Sanders has won his home state of Vermont and Colorado. Mr Biden took Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma and the battleground states of North Carolina and Virginia, but the two top prizes of the night - Texas and California - are yet to be declared.The results so far - particularly in Virginia and North Carolina - are a blow for Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and billionaire, who poured more than $500 million of his personal fortune into TV advertising in Super Tuesday states.The two other candidates still in the race, Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, and Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman, are both also facing serious questions about their viability. What a gripping night this is shaping up to be. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden appear to be neck and neck in Texas, the state with the second largest number of delegates available tonight. CNN polls show a margin of three points between the two candidates.Here\u0027s the demographic breakdown: Brad Parscale, Donald Trump\u0027s 2020 campaign manager, predicts tonight\u0027s results will end with a brokered convention, where no one candidate has enough delegates to win outright before the July event. In a statement, Mr Parscale said: “The results only increase the likelihood that no candidate will have enough delegates for a first ballot victory at their convention, which only means more chaos! The media is hyperventilating about Joe Biden but everyone should remember that he is just as terrible a candidate right now as he was a few days ago.At the same time, establishment Democrats have ganged up to try to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination, which is causing even more mayhem. Even if Bernie is not on November’s ballot, his big government socialist ideas will be because they have become mainstream in today’s Democrat Party. President Trump will wipe the floor with whatever Democrat is unlucky enough to be the nominee.”Polls have closed in delegate-rich California, with exit polls giving Bernie Sanders a 15-point lead in the state. If Mr Sanders maintains that lead, it will help him regain an edge on Joe Biden.There may be some tension in the Conway household tonight. George Conway, lawyer and husband to President Trump\u0027s senior aide Kellyanne Conway, has tweeted his support for Joe Biden. Mr Conway donated the maximum amount of $2,800 allowed for inidual donors to Mr Biden\u0027s campaign.Bernie Sanders\u0027 campaign requested an emergency injunction  asking for polls in Los Angeles County to stay open for an extra two hours after reports of delays and long lines in the Democratic primary vote.According to the request filed with Los Angeles County elections chief Dean Logan, multiple polling locations in the County have experienced extreme wait times for iniduals to vote, including wait times up to four hours to cast a ballot.Los Angeles County is one of several big jurisdictions in California that used new voting machines and procedures in the Super Tuesday primary.David Millward in Maine has this analysis on the New England results:It is no surprise that Bernie Sanders won Vermont. Things are looking interesting elsewhere in New England. There are signs that Elizabeth Warren is splitting the progressive vote. In her home state of Massachusetts, she is running in third place but has been backed by more than 20 per cent of voters.This is good news for Joe Biden, who has opened a seven per cent lead over over Mr Sanders.In Maine the result is on a knife edge where with nearly half the votes counted, Mr Sanders leads by just over 100 votes. Ms Warren has received nearly 15,000 votes, which could prove decisive.Joe Biden has won Massachusetts, which has 91 delegates at stake.Massachusetts was considered a must-win state for its home-state candidate, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, and election officials predicted high turnout. Nearly 230,000 voters took advantage of early voting last week, the first time the state has allowed early voting in a presidential primary.Ms Warren\u0027s viability in the race is now in serious doubt. Earlier today Mr Sanders\u0027 campaign refused to say whether Ms Warren should drop out of the race and endorse his campaign - something many progressive voters had urged - but it has cost Mr Sanders in some states. Meanwhile Mr Sanders has won the Utah primary, according to current projections. He won the state in 2016  against Hillary Clinton.Joe Biden hailed Super Tuesday as a good night that was getting even better as he addressed a crowd at his campaign HQ in Los Angeles, California. He has projected wins in seven states against three for Bernie Sanders. However the biggest prizes of the night - California and Texas - have yet to be declared.Jubilant Joe Biden takes selfies with supportersBen Riley-Smith, our US editor, watched the candidate working the line up close. Here\u0027s his report: Joe Biden was pumped up for his celebratory speech in Los Angeles, more energised than almost all of his campaign event stops in recent weeks. There\u0027s a reason they call it Super Tuesday! he said to a crowd of hundreds on a basketball court in the city - a rare outdoor event for a candidate. After the speech he headed to the audience, posing for selfies, giving hugs and shaking hands with jubilant supporters and, at one point, holding up a dog. One supporter had brought a giant Hope\u0027 Barack Obama poster, which he held aloft and repeatedly urge Mr Biden to sign. The supporter was, in the end, too far away to be heard.  Ed Hunsaker, who lives in LA and has been hoping for a Biden presidency for more than a decade, was watching on and said it had been a great night for the candidate.  Biden is a street-level guy. He knows what it means to try and get ahead, to get food on the table, Mr Hunsaker told The .  He gets that. He\u0027s never strayed from what he is.Paul Koretz, 64, who sits on the LA city council, was also looking on and said he did not predict this recent surge.  I have to admit a few days ago I did not see that coming. I\u0027m a Biden supporter through and through and I would have been with him to the end.  I\u0027ve been around politics for 50 years and I\u0027ve never seen a sudden turnaround like this ever before. Biden hails \u0026#34a great night\u0026#34 in Los AngelesMr Biden\u0027s speech was briefly disrupted by a handful of female protesters who attempted to jump onto the stage with anti-dairy signs. The first woman to reach the raised platform the former US vice president was speaking from managed to clamber up, forcing him to stop speaking.  Amid the commotion a security guard managed to manhandle the protester off the stage after a couple of seconds, but then more people rushed froward.  What appeared to be Mr Biden\u0027s secret service detail - he continues to have one thanks to the eight years he spent in the White House - intervened.  The protesters appeared to be against big dairy. They were the same group who interrupted Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, on Monday night during a speech in Los Angeles. Joe Biden has won Minnesota, Arkansas, according to exit polls in the state. Minnesota, which has 75 delegates up for grabs, is the home state of Amy Klobuchar, who suspended her campaign on Monday and endorsed the former Vice President. Bernie Sanders carried the state in 2016 and Ms Klobuchar\u0027s army of grass roots staff is being credited for Mr Biden\u0027s success in the state tonight.Meanwhile, Donald Trump is revelling in Mike Bloomberg\u0027s poor results.Bernie Sanders is taken the stage at a rally in his home state of Vermont, where he promises to win the Democratic nomination and defeat the “political establishment”.  You know, it\u0027s a funny thing, 31 years ago today we won the mayor race in Burlington, Vermont. And we won that race against all of the odds. Everybody said it couldn\u0027t be done. And when we began this race for the presidency, everybody said it couldn\u0027t be done. But tonight I tell you with absolute confidence, we are going to win the Democratic nomination. And we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of the country, he told the crowd in Essex JunctionNick Allen has an update from Texas:With a third of the vote in Bernie Sanders is winning the showdown in Texas. But it\u0027s far from over. Mr Sanders had a lead of about five points - 28 per cent to 23 per cent - over a resurgent Joe Biden, less than had been expected.Voters cast ballots at the politan Multi-Service Center polling station in Houston, TexasInterestingly, Michael Bloomberg is competitive with 19 per cent. All those adverts must have gained some traction. The largest population centre in Texas is Harris County, which includes the rapidly growing city of Houston. Mr Sanders and Mr Biden are tied there, with Mr Bloomberg just behind. In Travis County, which includes the liberal city of Austin, Mr Sanders is running away with it, followed by Elizabeth Warren.Overall, it seems that Mr Sanders has done well in the early vote - one million Texans voted early - but less well on election day. Mr Bloomberg is doing better than expected, and that may have taken votes away from Mr Biden.Mike Bloomberg will reassess his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Wednesday, according to NBC News.Here\u0027s a quick recap of the billionaire\u0027s spending in the Super Tuesday race:$224 million overall he spent on ads that ran in the 14 states voting today, according to data from Advertising AnalyticsOf that figure, $33.7 million went on TV, radio and digital adverts in Alabama, North Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, all of which have been called for his his opponentsJoe Biden is projected to have won Tennessee, but appears to have lost a few potential delegates to Mike Bloomberg. The state is a Republican strong hold and Democrats here tend to lean more towards the centre ground than in other states.  Exit polls project another win for Joe Biden - this time in Oklahoma, where the former vice president is currently around 12 points ahead of Bernie Sanders.The results appears to confirm Elizabeth Warren is having a very bad night. The Massachusetts senator grew up in Oklahoma and is struggling to cross the 15 per cent threshold required to win delegates.Mike Bloomberg is ignoring the Super Tuesday states, where he\u0027s faring poorly so far, and is focusing on the key swing state of Florida which votes on March 17. But reflecting the mood of the night, billionaire businessman left the stage after a lacklustre 10 minutes, in which he appeared to conceded he may not achieve the delegate wins he anticipated tonight. Bloomberg\u0026#39s campaign are worried by the early resultsThe billionaire businessman told a crowd in West Palm Beach:  “As the results come in, here’s what is clear. No matter how many delegates we win tonight we’ve done something no-one else thought was possible. We’ve gone from one percent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.”Mr Bloomberg has spent $500 million of his own money on campaign advertising and his campaign are understandably worried by the results in North Carolina and Virginia. His candidacy is now in doubt. Bernie Sanders has won the Colorado primary. The Vermont senator had been expected to win the state, which has 67 delegates up for grabs.David Millward reports that Bernie Sanders\u0027 supporters remain buoyant despite Joe Biden\u0027s early leads.Mike Bloomberg is projected to have won the American Samoa primary. The US territory has a population of 57,000 and sends 10 delegates to the Democratic Convention.Mr Bloomberg was widely expected to win here - having hired seven full-time staff and advertising heavily on radio, TV and in the local press.It appears to be a bad night for Elizabeth Warren, who may suffer the embarrassment of losing her home state of Massachusetts. According to CNN\u0027s exit poll, the state is a toss up between Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and the Massachusetts senator.Biden is projected to win a third state - Alabama, which has 52 delegates. All three states the former US vice president is projected to have won so far - Virginia, North Carolina and Alabama - have sizeable African American populations. If Mr Biden continues this success in the remaining southern states he may be able to offset any expected losses in California and Texas.Joe Biden is projected to score huge victories in Virginia and North Carolina and front-runner Bernie Sanders was expected to win his home state of Vermont, the first states to close their polls.A resurgent Biden has enjoyed a burst of momentum since a blowout win in South Carolina on Saturday, which led to endorsements from a flood of prominent party officials and former rivals.Key endorsements in Virginia include former governor Terry McAuliffe and Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer who managed an impressive victory in a Republican district in the state in 2018. This will stand Mr Biden in good stead in the state. It is a strong start for Joe BidenWith 14 per cent of the precincts reporting in Virginia, Mr Biden was winning more than half of the votes in that Southern swing state, well ahead of Mr Sanders, who was winning about a quarter of the vote.The former Vice President is also hoping to muscle aside Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, and consolidate support from moderates in Tuesday\u0027s voting, turning the race into a one-on-one contest against Mr Sanders.Sanders supporters cheer for early results at his rally in Essex Junction, VermontOpinion polls have shown Mr Biden gaining on Mr Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, who hopes to take a huge step toward winning the nomination on Tuesday.Early exit polls by Edison Research showed Mr Biden was powered once again by strong support among African-American voters, winning more than six of every 10 in Virginia and North Carolina.In Virginia, Mr Biden also won the votes of more than four of 10 white college educated women, compared to about two in 10 each for Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.Joe Biden is projected to win Virginia, CBS News is reporting. Elizabeth Warren\u0027s campaign has just announced a string of campaign events for later this week, signalling the Massachusetts senator has no plans to drop out of the race anytime soon. Ms Warren is travelling to Michigan for a town hall event on Friday, followed by one in Phoenix, Arizona and Boise, Idaho on Saturday. Ben Riley-Smith has this from a polling station in a liberal part of the cityOne of Bernie Sanders\u0027s great advantages is the enthusiasm and energy he engenders in his supporters, who then take to the streets to help his cause.  There was a good example of this at a polling station in South Pasadena, an affluent bit of Los Angeles, where more than a thousand voters are expected.  With a few dozen people queueing outside a rather grand library under the clear blue sky to vote, there was a volunteer from only one campaign around. Her name was Linda Krausen, a 78-year-old retiree, and she is a big Bernie fan. She had Bernie earrings, a Bern necklace and light blue nail paint.  Every time a voter approached she went across to explain how the computer system worked, reminding them you have to press \u0027next\u0027 on the candidates page to find everyone on the ballot. She was handing out a single piece of paper, some in English and some in Spanish, that outlined Mr Sanders\u0027s pitch.  Bernie is the candidate whose platform most strongly supports working people of America, one line read.  Ms Krausen also said she had been up until 3am last night going round the area putting out Bernie flyers for people to see today.  She said one voter told her she was going to back Joe Biden but then saw a Bernie poster on her car this morning and decided to switch at the last minute. Times that activism by 2,000 - the number of people the Sanders campaign has on the ground across LA County, according to officials - and you get a sense of the scale of the Bernie ground game.  Who knows how big an impact all those volunteers could have? Nick Allen in Texas reports:   There have been reports of some Texan voters waiting up to two hours to cast their ballots.It seems to be a mixture of high turnout and technical problems at some polling stations.Voter Austin Black told local TV he waited two hours at a public library in Dallas.The Dallas County elections department said there were longer than usual wait times.Pictures emerged of a long line outside a polling station at a court building in Mansfield, and at a Dallas location three out of the four voting machines were not working.Powerful tornadoes tore through Nashville, Tennessee and surrounding counties early on Tuesday, killing at least 22 people, leaving others missing and reducing homes and businesses to rubble as voters throughout the state cast ballots in the Super Tuesday presidential primary.In addition to the fatalities, at least 30 people were injured and about 48 buildings were destroyed in Nashville, with many more damaged, Fire Department Director Chief William Swann said. Tens of thousands of people were left without power.Despite the destruction, polling sites were mostly open for voting, officials said.Crushed vehicles, piles of debris and broken power lines littered streets blocked by rescue vehicles. Residents carried away belongings from ravaged homes.Donald Trump said that he will go to Tennessee on Friday.Nick Allen is seeing high voter turnout in San Antonio.At the public library in San Antonio a steady stream of voters made their way to polling machines. By lunchtime 271 people had voted. Anecdotal evidence from election officials suggested that was high. It came despite about 10 per cent of voters casting their ballots early before Election Day. An election official told me voting is expected to be boosted by a recent rule change. Previously, voters had to vote at a specific assigned polling station. But this time they can vote at any location. “It means we’re getting a lot of people coming in on their lunch hour because they work downtown,” said the official. “In the past they wouldn’t have had time to go home to vote.“ She added: ”It does feel larger than last time, although it’s hard to tell for sure.” Facing voters for the first time, Mike Bloomberg believes the only way he can win the nomination is at a contested convention in the summer.Well, I don\u0027t think that I can win any other ways, he said according to NBC.A brokered convention will almost inevitably trigger accusations from Bernie Sanders’ supporters that the Vermont Senator will have been the victim of an establishment “stitch-up.Mr Bloomberg, however, has dismissed the idea rounding on Mr Sanders.There are rules in the Democratic Party of how you go about this. And I did see Bernie Sanders said all of a sudden, he didn\u0027t want to follow the rules ... I find it offensive that Bernie Sanders, who the last time he ran was in favour of that kind of a convention, and now was opposed to it. I guess where you stand depends on where you sit.Mr Bloomberg, who is being urged to clear the path for Joe Biden by following the example of Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, is also showing no interest in pulling out of the race in which he has invested an estimated $500 million.Traders have been betting heavily on the Democratic race, according to Smarkets - a UK based prediction market platform. They have bet nearly $2.5 million on the outcome and the smart money seems to be going on Joe Biden, who has surged from eight per cent to 54 per cent to become the market favourite, overtaking Bernie Sanders who has slipped into second place at 35 per cent.Mike Bloomberg is trailing badly in third place at six per cent.But the bullish predictions for Mr Biden appear to have been undermined by the predictions for several of the key races, with the Vermont senator remaining favourite to win California, Texas and Massachusetts.There is growing speculation that California senator, Kamala Harris is set to endorse Joe Biden.Rumours have been circulating for a few weeks that she will throw her weight behind the former vice president.Now the gossip is that an endorsement is imminent.But few will forget how she skewered him in an early candidate’s debate over his record on race and his opposition to bussing, a policy which was used to desegregate schools“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” she said. “And that little girl was me.”Mr Biden was stunned by her remarks, accusing Ms Harris of a “mischaracterisation” of his position.Assuming the pair have patched up their differences, Ms Harris’s endorsement would be a huge boost for Mr Biden in California as he tries to head off Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich state.Ben Riley-Smith, our US Editor, has this from a chat with a Bernie fanWhy does Donald Trump keep talking about Bernie Sanders being robbed of the Democratic nomination? A conversation with a Sanders fan in Los Angeles provides an insight. David Nesbitt is a 54-year-old software engineer. I found him leaning against a wall in a blue Bernie T-shirt on Sunday, having just seen the Sanders rally with more than 10,000 others. I asked about moderate dropouts. Pete Buttigieg had just quite the race out hours earlier. This was before he and two other presidential rivals endorsed Mr Biden on Monday. Key dates for the democratic hopefulsThe ‘they’ in this case appeared to be the Democratic Party establishment. The suggestion - moderate leaders believe Mr Sanders cannot win and were moving to stop his path. Then I asked Mr Nesbitt if he would vote for Mr Biden if he ended up as the nominee. There was a very long pause, perhaps more than six seconds, face scrunched in thought. “I might, I don’t know,” he eventually said. “We’ll see.” He said he would never vote for Mr Trump, but did pledge to back whichever Democrat is on the ballot. This happened to Mr Nesbit in 2016. Mr Sanders lost the primaries, Hillary Clinton won. He did not vote for Ms Clinton, picking Jill Stein, the Green Party instead.Scores of others did likewise. It is one of the factors Ms Clinton most often cites when she is asked about the reasons behind her shock defeat to Mr Trump in 2016. Mr Nesbit pointed out that it did not matter how he voted in California, which will always go Democrat. He is right. But in the swing states, this could be a massive factor. If Bernie loses and his army sits on its hands or votes for a third party candidate, either because they do not believe in or feel betrayed by the Democratic nominee, it helps Mr Trump. Which is why the US president is doing all he can to whip up aggrievment now. This just in from Ben Riley-SmithDonald Trump has accused Democratic moderates of trying to rig the presidential nomination race against Bernie Sanders after a string of last-minute endorsements for his rival. The US president attempted to pour fuel on the isions in the party as voters went to the polls in 14 different states yesterday to pick who they want to take on Mr Trump. Speaking at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, the night before voting, Mr Trump said: “It’s being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie’s going to go crazy.”He accused Joe Biden, the former US vice president who was endorsed by three of his previous rivals in the race, of orchestrating an attempt to stop the Vermont senator.“They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal,” Mr Trump told his supporters. On Twitter he wrote: “They are staging a coup against Bernie!”Nick Allen in Texas writes:Joe Biden and Beto O\u0027Rourke chowed down at a Whataburger in Dallas last night. Whataburger is a Texan fast food institution and became synonymous with Mr O\u0027Rourke\u0027s 2018 run for the US senate.Beto O\u0026#39Rourke enjoys a \u0026#34Whataburger\u0026#34 with Joe BidenHe went to Whataburger a lot.. This is a first, said Mr O\u0027Rourke, as he arrived with the former vice president in tow.Hey, folks. How are you? said Mr Biden. The two politicians then gladhanded the dozen customers inside before Mr Biden said: Let\u0027s get some food.Mr Biden ordered a Whataburger with cheese and tomato, fries and a vanilla milkshake, paying with cash. He then donned a Beto t-shirt and sat in a booth with Mr O\u0027Rourke and his wife Amy, remarking on how good the milkshake was.As he tends to do Mr O\u0027Rourke livestreamed the whole event, and it was widely watched across Texas.Ben Riley-Smith, our US Editor, has this from the West coastHello from Los Angeles where the sun is shining and the polls are open. California is the most consequential state voting today. Why? Because of the massive haul of delegates - the metric that will determine the winner - up for grabs. There are 415 delegates available here. That is more than a quarter of all the Super Tuesday total. In fact it is a tenth of the entire nationwide delegate pot.Bernie Sanders, if the polls are right - a big if in today\u0027s politics, admittedly - has a massive lead here. In the latest poll of polls from Real Clear Politics he is 12 points ahead. But Joe Biden is surging, doubling his vote share and vaulting Elizabeth Warren according to the same rolling poll average. He was at 11 per cent on Friday, now 23 per cent today. Mr Sanders was here on Sunday. He held a raucous rally where actor Dick Van Dyke, comedian Sarah Silverman and Chuck D, the rapper from Public Enemy, all appeared on stage. (Yes, really.)Van Dyke, 94, joked about concerns over the 78-year-old\u0027s age, saying he was probably getting married the day Mr Sanders was born. Chuck D urged Californians to get off the couch and vote. He also performed Fight the Power, fist raised. Mr Biden has picked California for a results night event - an interesting selection, given he is not expected to win here. His wife, Jill Biden, also has a campaign stop-off in the day. Ms Warren held an outdoor rally here on Monday evening in East Los Angeles, a part of the city where the vast majority of the population are Hiic or Latino. There were a lot of placards in Spanish, with some reading persiste - in reference to a Senate speech when a Republican tried to shut her down and complained she persisted.Chants of It\u0027s  time for a woman in the White House and dream big, fight hard rung out. At the end a van served churros with caramel sauce to the departing supporters. Whoever wins here today may well have a delegate lead in the overall race come Wednesday. Odds are that will be Mr Sanders. Nick Allen in Texas writes:Joe Biden gave a deeply personal speech last night when he accepted Pete Buttigieg\u0027s endorsement. And it is quite clear that Mr Buttigieg would play a big part in any future Biden administration.The two men appeared at a bar called The Foundry in Dallas, which is well known for its fried chicken. Mr Biden described how, during televised debates, he had looked across the stage at the young mayor and been reminded of his late son Beau.Perhaps that was why Mr Biden never attacked Mr Buttigieg during the debates. Mr Biden said: There hasn\u0027t been a harsh word between us since we started to compete.I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever done this before, but he reminds me of my son Beau.I know that may not mean much to most people, but to me it\u0027s the highest compliment I can give a man or woman.Like Beau he has a backbone like a ramrod. I promise you, over the course of your lifetime, you\u0027re going to end up seeing a hell of a lot more of Pete than you are of me.Rozina Saburis on the ground in Fairfax County, Virginia. She writes: State officials are taking no chances in trying to avoid the sort of embarrassing glitches which turned  Iowa’s caucus into a shambles.Voter turnout appears to be lower so far today in Fairfax County, the county\u0027s director of elections, Gary Scott, tells me. In Virginia people vote in the mornings. Turnout is about 7 per cent right now,which is a little below what we’d expected, he says.Mr Scott says they have received a lot of questions about the coronavirus, but doesn\u0027t believe it\u0027s had any impact on voting day. There have been no cases recorded in Virginia, however there is one voter who requested an absentee ballot as he is currently in quarantine in Washington state, he adds.A little tidbit - Fairfax County is the only locality in Virginia which provides ballots in four languages - Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean and English. Here\u0027s what the ballot paper looks like:Fairfax county\u0026#39s erse population means ballots are printed in four languagesPundits expect that pockets of the state like this, which are ethnically erse, will favour Bernie Sanders. But at a voting centre at Graham Road Elementary School, voters I spoke to appeared evenly split between Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg.One voter, Holly Griffiths, says she is hoping for a Sanders or Warren victory. Bloomberg is just a Democratic Trump to me. Biden was a great vice president but he had a great leader and I don’t really have a lot of faith in what he’s going to do, she tells me. We are leaning definitely towards Sanders because he’s been in politics a long time and he’s done a lot for civil rights and the LGBQT community, and this country is horrific for healthcare.Out in the Pacific, the American territory of American Samoa has a population of 57,000 and sends 10 delegates to the Democratic Convention.Something of a constitutional oddity, the population can vote in the presidential primaries but not the presidential election itself.Mr Bloomberg has hired seven full-time staff in Samoa and is also advertising heavily on radio, TV and in the local press.It looks to have paid off with Chief Fa’alagiga Nina Tua’au-Glaude announcing she is endorsing Mr Bloomberg.“He has my family\u0027s vote, and my village. That\u0027s why I am committing my time and effort to electing Mike president of the United States. He will bring integrity and honour to the White House.Mr Bloomberg’s senior adviser in Samoa, Karen Green, said he is fighting for every vote and delegate.“We are proud to have Chief Tua\u0027au-Glaude\u0027s support and to have the largest ground game here in American Samoa before we caucus on Super Tuesday,” she said.“Mike\u0027s history of getting things done, and particularly his record of accomplishment in combating climate change, is moving voters our way.Having performed well in the early contests, the decision of Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg to suspend their campaigns raised a few eyebrows.It will probably have annoyed a number of voters who cast their ballot ahead of Super Tuesday to no avail.“Mayor Pete”, despite doing exceptionally well in Iowa and New Hampshire appeared to have plateaued and was hovering at around 11 per cent in national polling.Failing to make any impact among Latinos and African-Americans, it was clear that he faced an uphill battle to get above the 15 per cent threshold which is normally required to secure delegates at the national convention.Ms Klobuchar’s decision was also something of a surprise to her staffers, according to the New York Times. She gave no indication that she was pulling the plug on her campaign when she addressed a rally in Salt Lake City on Monday morning.With Bernie Sander’s juggernaut laying waste to much of the field, there was an air of panic among the Democratic establishment that the Vermont senator could prove unstoppable.Late last week John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman who was the first Democrat to announce he was running for the White House, penned an oped in the Washington Post urging other moderates to follow his example and end their campaign - thus paving the way for a single mainstream candidate.John Delaney urged moderates to unite behind one candidate“Everyone who enters the race for president has something to offer,” he wrote.“But only one person can win the nomination — the person who best answers the central question that voters are asking at that moment. And sometimes, even your best stuff is not good enough.”While not naming Bernie Sanders, Mr Delaney made it clear that mainstream candidates who stayed in the race risked splitting the moderate vote with devastating consequences.“But if they stay in, they must ask themselves: Will they continue to make a positive difference, or will they steer the race toward a candidate who either can’t win or can’t govern and, in so doing, undermine everything they care about?”Nick Allen in Texas writes:On Monday Texas celebrated its Independence Day - the day it split from Mexico in 1836. “This used to be Mexico,” voter Sylvia Mendez, 46, told me in San Antonio. “Candidates have to reach out.”By 2022 Hiic people will become the largest population group in Texas, and they are voting more too. A recent poll showed 64 per cent intended to vote in the next presidential election. Healthcare is the most important issue, and Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All policy is proving popular.His Hiic supporters call him “Tio Bernie“ (Uncle Bernie) and “El Abuelito” (Grandpa). It’s going to be hard for other candidates to compete.Nick Allen in Texas writes:One might expect Democrats in Texas to be more conservative or moderate than those on the coasts. In 2016 Bernie Sanders got trounced in the state. Hillary Clinton got 65 per cent of the vote and Mr Sanders only 33 per cent.But something has changed. There has been a shift in the centre of gravity. A new Emerson College poll showed many of those who voted for Mrs Clinton four years ago are backing Mr Sanders this time.“What’s most interesting is watching Bernie Sanders competing in a state that he lost by 30 points just four years ago,” said Spencer Kimball, a professor involved in the poll.Another, slightly astonishing, CBS News poll showed 56 per cent of Democrat voters in Texas now view socialism positively, while only 37 per cent view capitalism positively.David Millward writes: Even though she abandoned her own bid for the White House, Amy Klobuchar emerged as one of the early stars of the campaign. Over the weekend she was darting around the country, taking in four states in one day rallying support.  Her barnstorming style and quick wit went down well with voters who turned out in ever-increasing numbers to hear her speak.She could prove a real asset for the former vice-president, especially in her native mid-west where the Democrats will need to regain voters who backed Donald Trump in 2016.Ms Klobuchar gave Mr Biden a resounding endorsement at a rally in Dallas on Monday night.“Joe Biden has dedicated his life to fighting for people,” Ms Klobuchar said, before introducing Biden at the rally in Dallas on Monday night.“Not for the rich and powerful, but for the mom, for the farmer, for the dreamer, for the veteran. He can bring our country together.”Nick Allen in Texas  writes:On the eve of Super Tuesday everyone seemed to turn up in the Lone Star state. Apart from the front runner Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden, who is hot on Mr Sanders’ heels, held his final rally in Dallas. Both Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar suspended their campaigns and erted to Texas to endorse him.A voter checks his phone before casting his ballot during the presidential primary in Houston, Texas On an extraordinary evening for Mr Biden he then got the backing of Beto O’Rourke (remember him?). Mr O’Rourke, like a returning contestant from a previous season, joined Mr Biden on stage and gave him a big hug. It was an endorsement that’s will carry some real weight in Texas.The polls - and there are many - have been all over the place, with one putting Mr Sanders 15 points ahead. But the latest has Mr Biden trailing by just five. The superbly timed endorsements could put him over the top.Rozina Sabur in Virginia writes:Virginia has 99 delegates up for grabs, the fourth largest of any state voting on Super Tuesday. Given the state\u0027s mix of economic and social ersity, a candidate\u0027s success here will be a good litmus test for how the rest of the country will vote. Hillary Clinton narrowly carried the state against Donald Trump in 2016, but Virginia will be an important state in determining the outcome of November\u0027s presidential election.The state\u0027s rural parts are deeply conservative but northern Virginia and university-educated women in the suburban areas contributed to the Republicans losing the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. Today\u0027s primary is expected to be a two horse race between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, with the urban, university areas expected to support the progressive senator and the suburban parts more likely to vote in favour of the former Vice President.Mike Bloomberg has also been competitive in recent polls and he has spent a lot of his money and time in the state.  A poll of polls shows Mr Biden and Mr Sanders averaging 29 per cent and 24 per cent respectively, with Mr Bloomberg on 14 per cent. Which candidate wins in Virginia may offer a clue of what is to come. Polls close between 7 pm and 8 pm local time, depending on the state. However most of the Super Tuesday states have some form of widespread early voting. Voters in Minnesota, for example, could start casting ballots in January. Millions of postal ballot papers went out to California voters on Feb. 3, the day of the Iowa caucuses.Number of delegates available in each stateBernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg have had the widest and most aggressive footprint across the Super Tuesday states, largely because they\u0027ve got the money to spend. Mr Bloomberg is advertising in all 14 states, while  Mr Sanders is on the airwaves in 12. It\u0027s the first time Mr Bloomberg will be on ballots after he skipped the first four voting states, making the day a critical test of his theory that he\u0027s the best candidate to stand against Mr Sanders and, later, Donald Trump.Mr Sanders spent Sunday in California, holding rallies in the state\u0027s major liberal strongholds. He\u0027s hoping his monthslong focus on the state and resonance with Latino voters will help him win a large chunk of the state\u0027s 415 delegates. Joe Biden also plans to be in the state today. He hopes his strong showing in South Carolina is a harbinger of coming success with black voters, who dominate the Democratic electorate in a handful of Super Tuesday states. Meanwhile Elizabeth Warren may suffer the embarrassment of losing the primary in her home state of Massachusetts to Mr Sanders. While Super Tuesday won\u0027t necessarily determine who wins the nomination, it has historically been difficult for a candidate who performs poorly on the day to recover. Here\u0027s a look at Tuesday\u0027s contests. As well as California and Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Vermont, Utah, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Oklahoma are holding votes. The Super Tuesday states make up a erse range of voter groups. Most of the Southern states are Republican strongholds in the general election, while others like California are solidly Democratic. North Carolina is likely to be a battleground state in the general election.In California and Texas, white voters make up less than half the population. Hiics count for nearly 40 per cent of the populations in both states. California, meanwhile, has the nation\u0027s highest Asian population, at roughly 15 per cent. North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama and Arkansas have large populations of black voters, one of the Democratic Party\u0027s core voting blocs. The states blend a mix of urban and rural voters, as well as Democrats from all sides of the political spectrum. As candidates focus on wooing Southern Democrats in states like Texas and Arkansas, they must also be thinking about a message that can resonate in progressive San Francisco.Good afternoon and welcome to the \u0027s live blog. Our reporters will be bringing you the latest from across the country as 14 states and one US territory cast their votes in the Democratic nomination contest. Super Tuesday is when roughly a third of Democratic voters will cast their vote in the party\u0027s presidential nomination, making it one of the most significant points in the race to take on Donald Trump. This year has added significance because California, the state with the most delegates, will also have its say on the same day.A candidate needs 1,990 delegates to become the party\u0027s nominee. California has 415 delegates available, followed by Texas which has 228 and North Carolina which has 110. In all, there are 1,357 delegates available today.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

His dominating performance tonight represents one of the most remarkable comebacks in presidential primary history.Two factors are responsible for Biden\u0027s resurgence: the strength of his support among African American voters, and a rush of endorsements from former rivals for the Democratic nomination and prominent party leaders.Biden\u0027s longstanding ties to South Carolina and his eight years as Barack Obama\u0027s vice-president helped bring him his big victory there on Saturday, as did a crucial late endorsement from Representative Jim Clyburn.Biden\u0027s South Carolina win clearly precipitated a shift in Democratic leaders\u0027 thinking about the race. Pete Buttigieg dropped out and endorsed Biden on Sunday, while Amy Klobuchar did the same on Monday. Biden was also endorsed by Beto O\u0027Rourke, who ended his campaign months ago.State party leaders moved toward Biden as well. In Virginia, Biden racked up endorsements from Senator Tim Kaine, former senator John Warner, former governor Terry McAuliffe, and Representatives Bobby Scott and Don Beyer. In Texas, Biden won support from Representative Veronica Escobar, Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, and other state and local elected officials.Though Bernie Sanders is set to win California, there is little evidence that he is improving on his 2016 performanceThis late movement towards Biden clearly made an impact: so far, Biden has won the primaries in Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia. Exit polls show that many Democratic voters made up their minds very late in the game: according to CNN, 49 per cent of Virginia\u0027s primary voters made up their minds in the past few days, for instance, and almost a third did the same in North Carolina. In Minnesota, 55 per cent decided in the last few days Biden\u0027s win there demonstrates the impact of Klobuchar\u0027s endorsement in her home state.African-American votes were key to many of Biden\u0027s victories.  In Alabama, 44 per cent of the Democratic primary electorate was black 72 per cent of these voters supported Biden. In Virginia, black voters comprised 27 per cent of the primary electorate, and 71 per cent of them supported Biden. He won 57 per cent of the black vote in North Carolina and 62 per cent in Tennessee.Though she remains bullish, this could be the end of the road for Elizabeth WarrenBut Biden also showed strength in states such as Minnesota and Oklahoma, where the electorate is overwhelmingly white and where Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. Even in Sanders\u0027s home state of Vermont, Biden appears likely to clear the 15 per cent threshold to earn delegates in 2016, Sanders won all of Vermont\u0027s delegates. Sanders also won primaries in Utah and Colorado. But with four candidates meeting the threshold for delegates in Colorado, Sanders will not have the sort of edge he needs to make up for Biden\u0027s big wins elsewhere for that he must rely on an expected win in California. But that state\u0027s lengthy vote count means that we will not know how that translates into delegates for quite some time. In addition, Sanders\u0027s performance throughout the primary season has shown little indication that he is capable of delivering new voters in the sorts of numbers that might have made skittish Democratic leaders more open to him as their nominee. Instead, his support in 2020 appears to be about what it was four years ago. Nor has he shown much desire to expand his support to include other segments of the Democratic primary electorate.Meanwhile, Mike Bloomberg\u0027s attempt to do an end-run around the four early primary states and launch a candidacy on Super Tuesday has fizzled it appears that the former New York mayor has won only a handful of delegates, and won only in American Samoa\u0027s contest.Mike Bloomberg has spent a lot of money but only has victory in American Samoa to show for itSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is trailing in her home state\u0027s primary but has shown little sign that she is considering ending her campaign.Even with results still to come from California, and with contests in Maine and Texas too close to call, this has been a remarkable night for Joe Biden and his campaign.Christopher J.

Insurance policies for accident, illness and unemployment may cover wages lost to coronavirus infection.Sickness cover is unlikely to cover the cost of self-isolation or loss of earnings if work dries up because people are staying home in response to the virus.If you have this kind of protection policy, check what cover you have with your insurer.Uber’s “partner protection” policy, for example covers severe sickness and injury if a medical practitioner signs a driver off for over seven days. From day eight, drivers are eligible for a daily payment for up to 15 days.Work and pensions minister, Justin Tomlinson, attracted criticism when he suggested people rely on benefits if they could not work during the outbreak.“Those whose employers ask them to stay away from the workplace due to coronavirus concerns, who do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, may be able to claim Universal Credit andor new-style employment and support allowance,” he said.Universal Credit claimants have to wait up to five weeks for their first payment, however. Given that the government forecasts up to one fifth of the workforce is forecast to be off sick meaning that a significant number of people could struggle to make ends meet.People with no sick pay who may not be able to afford two weeks of self-isolationAlternatively, workers who are unable to work because of a health condition can claim employment and support allowance but only if they have paid National Insurance for the last two to three years.\u0026nbspThe rate for the first 13 weeks is up to £57.90 per week if your aged under 25 or up to £73.10 for over-25s. It then rises to as much as £111.65 depending on inidual circumstances.A spokesperson for the UK government’s Department for Work and Pensions said: “Our staff are ready to support people if they are affected – we urge them to contact us by phone, or their work coach via their online journal, to explain their situation.If people have to stay home on less than full pay, more people will get into debt. The Money and Pensions Service estimates that 16.7 million people are struggling or squeezed, and these may be particularly unlikely to have financial resilience to get through a period of reduced income.\u0026nbsp“It often only takes one knock to income to push people into problem debt,\u0026nbspsays Sue Anderson, of StepChange debt charity.“Once the immediate threat of coronavirus does pass, it really must be a long term policy goal to improve financial resilience and the way that the welfare system works so that more people are better able to weather short-term financial shocks without being tipped into problem debt.”Further advice on managing debt is available on StepChange’s website:\u0026nbsphttps:www.stepchange.orgShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The earth is slowly moving\u0026nbspMore trouble at the mill for Barclays.\u0026nbspAhead of the bank’s AGM, Jupiter Asset Management, one of its top 25 shareholders, has announced that it plans to back a shareholder resolution calling on the bank to phase out providing financial services such as lending to fossil fuel companies and utilities that fail to align with goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree Barclays bankers cleared of £4bn crisis deal with QatarBarclays should call time on golden hellos as it seeks a new CEO Jupiter is fairly middle of the road when it comes to UK fund managers.\u0026nbspIt’s not a corporate governance stick in the mud. It will use its voting power and take stances. But it’s not an ethical investment boutique and nor would you group it with, say, a Hermes, or one of the other more cutting edge institutional investors on the subject of climate change.It wasn’t one of the 11 big investors that signed up to the resolution at the outset, when campaigning group ShareAction was shaking the trees and looking for supporters, either.\u0026nbspIts decision to offer its support now is thus significant, all the more so because the resolution isn’t one of those wooly ones that call for more disclosure. It demands that Barclays takes concrete action to change its business.\u0026nbspThis could be seen as further evidence of the way the ground is shifting in the investment community.\u0026nbspFund managers are increasingly seeing climate change as a business risk, one that will hurt them\u0026nbspby wreaking economic damage and crimping returns. They are starting to\u0026nbsptake\u0026nbspit very seriously and are thus demanding that investee companies take it very seriously.Resolutions like this one rarely win, although sooner or later the dam\u0026nbspwill break.Even if it doesn’t this time, a significant vote in favour will still send a powerful message to Barclays’ board, which has come up with the usual guff about listening to shareholders in response to the move, and whomever is appointed to fill the roll of chief executive when Jes Staley departs.\u0026nbspBehind the scenes, the bank has quietly argued that it should be compared with a US, rather than a European peer group, because\u0026nbspit is a transatlantic investment bank.\u0026nbspThat won’t wash. It simply says, look, our peer group is ok with mucking up the planet so you should let us carry on too. Its a specious and short term argument.\u0026nbspThe bank also needs to wake up to the fact that while European money managers are ahead of the curve when it comes to the climate crisis, there have been tentative signs that American ones are belatedly starting to wake up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Staff who were unable to work because of recent floods were still paid, in contrast to the approach of some retailers which rely on zero-hour or flexible contracts.The policy of full pay for staff who isolate themselves from coronavirus is also likely to be popular, although Mr Whiteside said it may be reviewed if the outbreak becomes a “major problem”.There is no legal right to pay if a worker is not sick but cannot work because they have been told by a medical expert to self-isolate, according to guidance from employment dispute resolution service Acas.Mako Vunipola in self-isolation amid coronavirus fearsPeople who have had to go into quarantine or are abroad in an affected area and not allowed to travel back to the UK, also have no right to sick pay.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The tests simulate a range of potential shocks, including\u0026nbspa dramatic economic slowdown in China and Hong Kong. The Chinese economy has been impacted significantly by the virus with factories shut down and planes grounded, delivering a knock-on effect for companies that source goods and materials from China.“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” Mr Carney said. “Certainly the situation we are entering, the economic situation we are entering because of the virus – we didn’t run a stress test against that specific situation but we can learn from the stress tests we’ve been carrying out since 2014 about the resilience of the institutions against that type of risk.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t have any zero contract hours,” he told the BBC.Wetherspoons said last week that its 45,000 employees would be paid statutory sick pay if they isolate themselves.

Basically, how do you tell if the feedback is real or someone trying to manipulate the system? Or probably real or probably trying to manipulate the system,” Musk said.“Some way to differentiate between, this is a real person and this is someone just trying to manipulate the system. I see people trying to sway public opinion, and sometimes it can be difficult to figure out what’s real public opinion and what’s not.”Reports of Elliott Management’s investment emerged just days after Twitter announced new measures to tackle misinformation on the platform.A spokesperson for Elliott Management had no comment on the reports and Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This could include an adequate data plan on a mobile device that allows you to hotspot an internet connection wirelessly from your phone or tablet.Space images show drastic drop in China pollution as coronavirus hitsIf connecting to a work\u0026nbspserver meant only for internal use, it may be necessary to set up a virtual private network (VPN) in order to access it.\u0026nbspVPNs\u0026nbspand anti-malware software are also advisable for anyone using a\u0026nbspWiFi\u0026nbspnetwork they do not control, such as in a cafe or co-working space, however this should not be an issue for anyone in quarantine.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added that self-isolation should be considered “sickness for employment purposes”.How much pay a worker receives will depend on their contract, with most employers offering a certain number of sick days on full pay.Even if employers do not offer sick pay, workers are entitled to\u0026nbsp statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. It amounts to £94.25 per week and is paid from the fourth day of sickness.Those hardest hit will be anyone who is self-employed or who work in the gig economy, who are not entitled to SSP\u0026nbspif they self-isolate. The Department for Work and Pensions has said that anyone deemed a public health risk could claim universal credit or contributory employment and support allowance.​Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But others didn\u0027t – meaning that users might be happily navigating around their various apps, before being hit by the shocking white of WhatsApp or any other app that had so far failed to add its own dark mode.WhatsApp group chats can be found on GoogleNow users that are using the latest versions of Google or Apple\u0027s operating system – Android 10 or iOS 13 – will be able to switch the mode on from their phone\u0027s settings.Dark mode for\u0026nbspWhatsApp\u0026nbspoffers a fresh look on a familiar experience, the company said in a blog post.It\u0027s designed to reduce eye strain in low light environments. And we hope it helps prevent those awkward moments where your phone lights up the room.It also said that the change should make the app easier to read, by highlighting only the most important content.WhatsApp made a special video – titled Hello Darkness and including a previously unreleased version of The Sound of Silence by Paul Simon – to celebrate the launch of the feature.For users who have WhatsApp and their operating system updated to the latest version, enabling the mode should be as easy as switching on dark mode in settings. Users on Android 9 or earlier can switch on the theme in WhatsApp specifically, by heading to the settings, selecting chats and then picking the dark theme.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And so we must recognise that at this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our nation together, he said.

number of delegates in the primary race. State election officials in 15 counties reported issues with their computer systems, according to the Los Angeles Times. The result was that many people were only able to cast provisional ballots, and their eligibility would not be confirmed until after election day.\u0026nbspMany voters reported an issue with internet connectivity at some polling stations, according to the report.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“There is no evidence of malicious activity, and all counties have restored connectivity at this time,” Sam Mahood, a spokesman for Secretary of State Alex Padilla, told the LA Times. “This should not prevent any voters from casting a ballot, as counties have contingency procedures in place to check in voters.”Bloomberg slammed for correcting reporter\u0027s pronunciation of TexasThe celebrities taking to the polls this Super TuesdayLos Angeles introduced the new voting system ahead of the crucial Super Tuesday vote, in the biggest change to its polling procedure in decades.\u0026nbspBut some analysts had warned against rolling out the new system for the first time for such a large-scale and important vote. \u0026nbspJennifer Cohn, an election integrity advocate, compiled a list of more than 90 media reports and social media posts from voters reporting problems with the new machines.\u0026nbsp“A TWO-THREE HOUR wait to vote in Los Angeles county is not OK.

Others are on borrowed time.Casualties could yet include the biggest fish of all, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill — Rutnam’s predecessor at the Home Office.If he survives, it will be at the cost of his second huge job as head of national security.Few of these shadowy Whitehall aristocrats will welcome Sir Calamity’s decision to wash their dirty linen in public.And with a career-long ­catalogue of costly blunders to his name, drama queen ­Rutnam could yet regret suing for unfair dismissal.Witnesses might testy to his “sneaky and snivelling” ­managerial style — including perhaps Amber Rudd, who blames him for destroying her career as a Cabinet high-flier.Rutnam left her to swing for his department’s unforgivable Windrush scandal and the deportation of innocent West Indian migrants.As Ms Rudd fell on her sword, Rutnam “went missing”.“She repeatedly asked for the information but it was never forthcoming,” says a friend.“Then a week after she resigned, the data was made available. The whole thing was very odd.”In other words, it stinks.Sir Philip had little time for Priti Patel.“He seemed to think Priti was stupid and treated her as such,” says an insider.Once exposed to daylight, such arrogance, coupled with third-party allegations of racism, can be politically explosive.We are witnessing a deceptively important battle on the home front, fought in parallel with Brexit.Downing Street believes it is winning the fight for ­sovereignty. But the mandarins are fighting a Fth Column battle to keep Britain tied to the EU’s apron strings.“The first six months are critical,” says a senior ­ministerial source. “It’s all to play for.”MILLIONAIRE lawyer “Sir” Keir Starmer QC – he pretends to hate the title – is now a racing certainty for Jeremy Corbyn’s job as Labour leader.This chameleon politician is a protege of Labour dud Gordon Brown. They remain close.It was Brown who made Starmer Director of Public Prosecutions, a post he disgraced by ­persecuting innocent journalists for publishing the truth.He was rewarded with his knighthood and one of ­Labour’s safest seats in posh Holborn and St Pancras, a stone’s throw from his Doughty Street Chambers.Labour is welcome to the cad. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

pushed to make sure they clean their hands as thoroughly as possible to stop the spread of the killer coronavirus bug.The Health Secretary yesterday warned people should scrub their mitts for at least  seconds to destroy as many germs as possible.He told Radio  Live: You should do that for  seconds or more, and the way we explain it to children is that you should sing… wash your hands as long as you’re singing either Happy Birthday or God Save The Queen.This morning shadow Health Secretary Jonathon Ashworth said he would support shutting down cities to control the spread of coronavirus.Mr Ashworth said: If the medical advice and the scientic advice is to take measures along those lines, of course we would support them.If the medical advice is to do something like that then of course we should support it.Symptoms of Covid- can include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene.If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with others.You should also cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze then throw it away and wash your hands.Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces which you may have touched is also important.If you have ed from Wuhan in the last  days:If you are in Northern Ireland, call your GP.Please follow

eastenders","story":"It feels like it’s been going at least  years, partly because it survives on just half a dozen endlessly repeated stories, but also due to the fact its shrill tone, right-on agenda and obsession with long-suffering, alcoholic women and spineless men has been copied by almost every other mainstream drama on TV.Take, for instance, last night, where you had the choice of ITV’s Liar or BBC’s The Split.Such a miserable offering, I flipped a coin, lost and ended up watching The Split.If you haven’t suffered like I have, I should explain this is basically just a middle-class version of EastEnders set in a family law firm run by matriarch Ruth and her daughters, who are straight from central soap casting.There’s Nina, the hot one, an alcoholic shoplter who can’t get a bloke.And there’s Hannah, who’s as plain as an envelope and has men fighting over her in the street.There is another one as well, Rose, who can’t get pregnant.But writer Abi Morgan hasn’t the ­faintest idea what to do with her, so the drama tends to revolve around the ­miserable-as-sin Hannah, played by Nicola Walker, who’s been having the least steamy affair in television history with a walking Grolsch advert called Christie Carmichael.They bonded over a mutual love of swimming and legal jargon and now refer to their encounters as “Grayling,” like it was a Prohibited Steps Order.He’s a bit of a git, obviously. As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds. So together they are . . .A right pain in the ar*e.Tala Gouveia is ambitious, no-nonsense DCI Lauren McDonald, who’s come down to Bath, from London, saying things like: “I’m here for two years, tops. Don’t get attached to me.”I won’t.DS Dodds is her dorkish, time-serving partner, played by Jason Watkins, with a non-specic Yokel accent.It could be Bath, it could be Ba’ath Party. The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds.

She was concerned that he was not really talking to her.In her defence, Cordice had claimed sexual activity only occurred because she had been continually allegedly raped by the boy over a period of just over a year.But the prosecution pointed out that she sent him messages vying for his attention, and asked why she would have done sothe rape claim were true.Reading out WhatsApp messages between the two, Ms Ong told the court that Cordice had said to the boy: I want to talk to you. I want a conversation.You do not talk to me. You are always acting blunt with me. I just want our friendship back.Your profile picture is cute by the way. It is cute.The boys dad had told the jury about seeing a message from Cordice to the boy saying I love you, I love you.Ms Ong said the case was about, a manipulative liar. That manipulative liar is Leah Cordice.She did not lie because she was scared of getting the boy into trouble, she did not lie because of her husband, because he already knew she was having sex with the complainant.But she has lied to you, members of the jury.In doing so, she has accused the complainant of what is a horrendous crime against her, of a  and  year old boy committing rape.Cordice has denied five counts of sex with a child, three of which were said to have taken place while she was aged , and two while she was  years old.The trial continues.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Peter Hall, professor of public health at the University of Waterloo, described mobile phones as “portable petri dishes”.He suggests people should clean their phones at lunch and after ing home in the evening to kill germs collected at work and while commuting.The elderly are most at risk from the virus and doctors are urging people to stay away from vulnerable relativesthey are ill.Todays doomsday battle plan also spelled out proposals to urge elderly people to keep away from public events such as Mays VE Day celebrations.The -page document warned it will be providing advice to local authorities in dealing with a potential spike in deaths among elderly and vulnerable patients.The death rate from coronavirus in China - where the virus first spread - has been ten times higher in over s compared to those aged under .Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the World Health Organisation last week said: If you are +... you have a higher risk of developing severe #COVID. Try to avoid crowded areas, or places where you might interact with people who are sick.Public Health England has urged people ing to the UK from countries worst hit by coronavirus to seek medical advice.People who have ed from Hubei province in China, lockdown areas in northern Italy or special care zones in South Korea since mid-February should stay indoors, avoid contact with other people and call NHS  - evenshowing no symptoms.Brits ing from other parts of China, South Korea and northern Italy or Cambodia, Hong Kong, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Myanmar Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam with any symptoms should also self-isolate and call .A full list of affected areas can be found on the Public Health England website.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is currently advising against all travel to Hubei Province and all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China.It is also urging people against all travel to Daegu in South Korea and all but essential travel to the city of Cheongdo.All but essential travel is also not recommended to  towns in the Lombardy and Veneto regions of Italy.Clothing is another key way viruses can be carried and spread by humans.NHS guidance recommends washing at clothes at C or C with a bleach-based powder or detergent.Using a dryer on high heat can also help kill harmful bacteria and stop bacteria surviving and multiplying on damp clothes.People are also recommended to wash their hands after handling dirty laundry.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said there is currently no need for mass school closures or the cancellation of sports events and other large gatherings.But people with underlying health conditions could be asked to stay at home to avoid infectionthe disease continues to spread.Coronavirus death rates among people with diabetes and underlying heart and respiratory problems have been more than  times higher than those with no previous health problems across the globe.People ensuring their vaccinations are up to date will also help ease pressure on the NHS.Commuters and shoppers wearing faces masks is becoming an increasingly common sight across the UK as coronavirus spreads.But the World Health Organisation has advised healthy people should only wear a maskthey are taking care of someone suspected to have the virus.If people are ill, masks are only effective when used in combination with frequent hand washing andthe masks are properly disposed of.People who have been diagnosed with coronavirus or who are ill after ing from an affected area should not be out in public - with or without a mask.There is no need for mass stockpiling of food or other goods but medics have suggested it could be wise to keep some essentials handy in case of the need for self-isolation.Ian Mackay, virologist at the University of Queensland, Australia, said buying extra long-lasting foods such as cereals, pasta, fruit and tinned fish could help those told to stay indoors.Matt Hancock and other health has said he hopes not to have to bring in emergency legislation to cancel large events and has urged schools and businesses to follow official advice before any shutdown.He said: Right now, we do not recommend the cancelling of mass events and schools as well should not be closing unless there is a positive case and the schools have the advice to close.There maybe things we have to do down the line that we dont want to, but we will need the powers to do that hence proposing emergency legislation.People are also urged to use the NHS  service and only attend hospital in case of an emergency as the health service comes under increasing strain.For the majority of people coronavirus will be best treated through self-isolation and over the counter medicines.If you have to self-isolate at home, your firm should let you take that time as sick pay.Your employer can choose to pay you your full salary while youre off sick but the statutory minimum entitlement is currently £. per week.Statutory Sick Payonly kicks inyou work for an employer, are sick for at least four days in a row and earn on average at least £ per week .These rules still applyyou are working on a part-time or fixed-term contract.If you cant get sick pay, you may be able to negotiate working from home during this time so your pay isnt affected.Its worth checking with your employer what their policy is as some may require you to provide a letter from a doctor after five days.No said today that firms should not tell their employees to get a sick note from their doctors.People who are not entitled to sick leave include people who are self-employed, members of the armed forces, those who have received Employment and Support Allowance in the past three months, people in legal custody or those who have already received SSP for  weeks.Workers on zero-hour contracts are entitled to SSP too, as long as theyve done some work for the company and been ill for at least four days in a row, including their days off.Although its not officially advice, it makes sense to try and keep your commutes as safe and effective as possible.If you have the option of not taking public transport, your company may ask you to consider that instead.If you do have to use public transport, extra personal distancing from your fellow commuterswould be sensible, and washing your hands after you get off the tube cant hurt either.The UKs battle plan to tackle coronavirus was revealed by Boris Johnson today as the country prepares for the illness to spread.The number of people in the UK who have tested positive for the virus stands at .UK cases include a worker at the North East London NHS Foundation Trust offices at Vinters Business Park near Maidstone in Kent, a pupil from Churston Ferrers grammar school in Torbay, a teacher at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and the parent of a pupil at a school in Stevenage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things are going great between us – we spent Christmas with each other’s families and we’re planning a trip together this summer. My only problem is, I don’t like her group of friends. They’re very shallow and always bitching and gossiping. They’ve never been that nice to me and I always feel I’m on trial every time we’re out with them. She’s not like the rest of them at all, so I’m confused about why she wants to hang out with them. They’re just not very nice and I don’t trust any of them. I hate the thought of these people being in our lives, but what can I do about it  I thought maybe it was just me, but then I invited some of my mates on a night out and they agreed with me – “What does she see in them ” was the general opinion. I’ve never told her how I really feel about them and don’t know whether I should. I don’t want it to become an issue that causes problems between us. What do you think  Coleen says I think perhaps you’re worrying about it more than you should. In reality, you probably don’t have to see them that much and, as your relationship develops, you’ll probably see even less of them. But you shouldn’t encourage her not to see them. They are her friends and maybe they have a shared history that goes way back to college or school. If you do start to interfere, she’ll resent it and you’ll come across as controlling. Would you accept itshe told you she didn’t like your mates and didn’t want you to see them  I know it’s not idealyou don’t get on with your partner’s friends, but most of the time it’s just the two of you and that’s what you have to focus on.

The doomsday document warns Brits could see more troops on the streets, sports matches and schools closed and police forced to abandon low-level crime to maintain public order. A fth of Brits could be off sick at once, an army of NHS staff could be pulled out of retirement and people turfed out of hospitals early - not to mention a dilemma for councils in dealing with more bodies. The pressures on services and wider society may start to become signicant and clearly noticeable, the document says. And even more than one in five could be off worktheyaposre caring for the sick. At a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson insisted our country remains extremely well prepared. He said the Army could be called inneeded and sick pay rules would be kept under review. But Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned up to % of Brits could be infected, % of whom die - though he stressed it would probably be a lot lower than that.  Prof Whitty added: Even for the highest-risk group, the great majority of people will survive this. Soyou look at the Chinese data,you take the very oldest people, the great majority survive. So it is important to stress that. Andyouaposre talking about the low-risk groups the rate of mortality is well below %. So I think thereaposs always a danger people think this has actually got a higher risk than it actually has for them personally.A Downing Street press conference heard whole-city lockdowns like in China are unlikely - and there was “no need” to panic-buy goods, which could make the situation worse. But Boris Johnson admitted: There are long established plans by which the police will keep the public safe, prioritise those things they have to do. The Army is of course always ready to backfill as and when. But that is under the reasonable worst case scenario.  Meanwhile the government will consider passing new lawsnecessary to help public authorities cope - while the services we rely on may be reduced temporarily. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock is thought to have spoken to chiefs at social media firms, including Twitter, urging them to help the responsible spread of accurate information about the outbreak. Now remember, this is only a potential plan for later stages of the outbreak - which the government doesnapost expect for weeks or even months,it happens in the UK. But bearing that in mind, what exactly does it say  Hereaposs a guide to  key points. . Remember! For now, the advice is pretty much what you know already  Itaposs important to stress that the governmentaposs plan has four stages - contain, delay, research, mitigate. Currently we are still on Stage One, and the plan accounts for all four stages over a period of several months. For now, the public health advice is much simpler than most of whataposs in the document:Follow public health advice on hand washing -  seconds with hot water and soap Rely only on trusted sources of information such as the government and NHS websites Check and follow the latest Foreign Office travel advice Check your family’s vaccinations for other conditions are up to date Check on elderly or vulnerable family, friends and neighbours Use NHS , pharmacies and GPsand only go to AE when really needed Go into self-isolationyou are advised to by the NHS, but not otherwiseAuthorities already have the legal power to “detain and direct” people in quarantined areas, and apply for court orders to force people to undergo quarantine and medical examination” - under emergency laws passed in the last few weeks. Itaposs thought the main way the virus is transmitted isyouaposre standing less than  metres from someone who sneezes, for example. Oryou touch a surface that has droplets from a cough or sneeze, and then touch your face. Thataposs why handwashing is so important.  The reason the plan has been drawn up is because, as it admits, “it may be that widespread exposure in the UK is inevitable. Weaposre all susceptible to catching the disease”, because thereaposs no vaccine and no natural immunity in our bodies yet. Officials believe the containment phase is almost over and whataposs more, the course of the disease cannot be predicted accurately at this point”. The strategy is to delay the peak of the outbreak as much as possible until the summer, when the NHS is under less strain from other illnesses like flu. That also “buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines, the plan says. If we do reach the third and particularly the fourth stages of the outbreak - hereaposs what might happen. Andwidespread exposure happens... . Gatherings like football matches may be banned  The plan confirms that large gatherings, like sports matches or the London Marathon, could be banned. It says: “Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategiesto slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, whilst ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as possible. However, there is no information currently about which events might be banned, for how long, or with how much notice - because itaposs simply too early to tell. The plan says: “Such judgements will be informed based on the best available and and most up-to-date scientic evidence and taken into account the trade-offs involved.” By apostrade-offsapos, the government is talking about the hit to the economy and public order. When it comes to sports matches, itaposs thought the risk could be higher from cramming into the pub afterwards than the actual match. Thataposs because itaposs thought the virus can only usually be transmitted in close proximity. Pensioners could be advised to stay away from big public gatherings like the VE Day celebrations. The plan makes clear troops could be used to support public bodies like the NHS and councils. It says: The Ministry of Defence has put in place plans to ensure the deliver of its key operations in the UK and overseas. There are also well-practised arrangements for Defence to provide support to Civil Authoritiesrequired. . A fth of all Brits could be off work at once  The plan admits everyone will face increased pressures at work, not to mention caring for themselves and others who might have the virus. It states: In a stretching scenario, it is possible that up to one fth of employees may be absent from work during peak weeks. This may y for inidual businesses. There will be case-by-case mitigation for small firms unable to pay their taxes or other duties due to cash flow issues. This will be run through HMRCaposs Time to Pay system. . Police could have to abandon low-level crime  Police and firefighters would be among the hardest-hita fth of Brits end up off work. The plan says they will “enact business continuity plans to ensure they are able to maintain a level of service that fulfils their critical s. For example, with a signicant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order.” . Councils face dealing with more bodies in makesht morgues  The plan does not explicitly refer to bodies and morgues but it makes reference to them obliquely. It says: “There could well be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak, particularly amongst vulnerable and elderly groups.” Councils are to be given advice by central government on “dealing with this challenge”, it adds. Councils are the organisations responsible for dealing with death registrations, morgues and inquests - and inquests already have a very long waiting time, taking months or even years to complete. . Patients could be turfed out of hospitals early.. with doctors brought out of retirement  If there is a serious outbreak, health and social care bodies would be asked to work together to support early discharge from hospital and to look after people in their own homes, the plan says. Patients could also be turned away from hospitalthey have low-level conditions and routine operations could be postponed. The plan saysdoctors and nurses themselves become ill in large numbers, NHS hospitals may recommend a signicantly dferent approach to admissions. That would see staff re-deployed to prioritise and triage service delivery. The pressures on the NHS - especiallydoctors and nurses become sick - could force people whoaposve left or retired from the NHS to come back. Staff rostering changes may be necessary, including calling leavers and retirees back to duty, the plan says. . We could use emergency laws to enforce testing at the border Border force officers will be able to enforce testing for coronavirus at the UKaposs borders under the plans.Public health officials are already at international ports and airports but have not been able to insist on swabbing.Among the new emergency measures being drafted include giving them the right to test overseas visitors.. Schools could be closed  The clear advice is that schools should not close unless specically directed to by Public Health England. That advice would continue, but it may well be that more schools are told to close by the authorities. The governmentsapos education departmentsapos planning assumptions include the possibility of of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection, the plan adds.  . People could have to work more from home As stated above , workplaces could count as large-scale gatherings and need to send people home. However, the plan suggests this would be encouraged rather than enforced , and obviously there are some professions where itaposs not possible. . Contact tracing could have to be abandoned  At the moment health authorities are piling huge resources into painstakingly tracing every person that an infected patient came into contact with. However, as the virus spreads this may become impossible, or a bad use of resources that could be used to treat the sick. The plan says contact tracing “may lose effectiveness” and officials may need to direct their resources where in future. The Chief Medical Officer said there may come a point where it’s “so great” that containment “ceases to make sense”. He added: “We have not reached that point, but we could reach that point.” . Medicine stockpiles would start being depleted  The UK “maintains strategic stockpiles of the most important medicines and protective equipment” for healthcare staff, the plan says. “These stocks are being monitored daily, with additional stock being ordered where necessary”. However, the plan says the UK may need to draw down on stockpiles of medicines and medical devices in the case of a widespread outbreak. There are no numbers of estimates of how quickly this might happen. . And there could yet be ‘multiple waves’ of the illness It may not be a simple case of one peak, the plan says - and a more long term plan may be needed. “It is possible that an outbreak or pandemic of COVID- could occur in multiple waves”, it says. . But despite it all, the government says weaposre well-placed to deal with it These are all doomsday plans, of course. But the government is also trying to reassure people. The plan says the government has “planned extensively over the years for an event like this, and the UK is therefore well prepared to respond in a way that offers substantial protection to the public.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how uks coronavirus sick pay","story":"NewsHow UKs coronavirus sick pay laws compare to the rest of EuropeGovernment advice is thatyou have come into contact with someone who may be infected you should self-isolate for a period of two weeks or until given the all-clear.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe UK is lagging well behind other European countries when it comes to rights relating to sick pay and self-isolation, a union has warned. Government advice is thatyou have come into contact with someone who may be infected you should self-isolate for a period of two weeks or until given the all-clear. But trade union Prospect, professionals including engineers, scientists, managers and civil servants, are warning that many sick pay policies in the UK wonapost cover situations where staff are forced to take two weeks off work, despite the government asking them to pay. The only guarantee is that workers will be entitled to be Statutory Sick Pay. But this does not cover the first three days of absence and is capped at £. per week.  Prospect has also uncovered that many insurance policies for freelancers do not cover self-isolation. This means that many people are faced with the impossible choice of either following the government’s advice or getting paid.Workers affected by coronavirus who are not eligible for sick pay may be able to claim Universal Credit , according to Business Secretary Alok Sharma.But, according to their research, in many other European countries, this is not the case, with the government’s being proactive in their support for workers. Prospect are asking is asking for the government to compel businesses to cover pay when employees are affected by COVID- or have to self-isolate and to lobby insurance companies for them to cover self-isolation. They have also asked ministers to establish a system to cover any lost earnings due to self-isolation that are not covered by insurance or by employers and to support businesses who cannot afford to provide this enhanced cover.  Rules for workers around EuropeFinland – workers receive benefits equivalent to full pay from day one of isolation. France – the French government changed the law a month ago to make it clear to employers than anyone who was self-isolating under government advice qualies for sick leave in the same way as anyone who is ill. Netherlands – The government say employers cannot oblige workers to use holiday leavethey are in isolation and must continue to pay them as normal. Sweden – it is an employers’ responsibility not only to minimise the spread of any infection, andthey ask an employee to self-isolate they must pay them whether or not they can carry out work. Spain - a salaried employee who is self-isolating under the advice of authorities will be entitled to the same sick leave cover as they would usually get – regardless of whether they are in fact ever diagnosed with the coronavirus.Prospect General Secretary Mike Clancy said: “The UK is lagging well behind its European neighbours in providing a sensible system of provisions for workers doing the right thing in responding to the threat from COVID-.“Countries like France, the Netherlands and Sweden already have clear and fair systems in place so that nobody doing their civic duty will be out of pocket. The UK government has so far refused to confirm what,anything, it will do in these circumstances. “Workers need clarity from their employers thatthey self-isolate they will not lose out,they don’t give it then the government must compel them. Similarly, businesses need clarity from the government on their responsibilities and on how they will be supported. “If the government, workers and business work together we can deal with this problem without it becoming a full-blown crisis.”Last week, Labour had called on the Government to ensure that the employment rights of workers on zero hour contracts who are self-isolating should be protected."},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer publishes leadership campaign","story":"NewsKeir Starmer publishes leadership campaign donations amid transparency rowThe shadow Brexit secretary’s biggest donation comes from Robert Latham, a Camden Labour activist and barrister who practised at Doughty Street Chambers – like Starmer who has handed over £,.

He revealed a number of fresh donations when the parliamentary register was published today. But the frontrunner is being accused of delaying the publication of thousands of pounds in donations to his campaign after his competitors voluntarily published the names of those who had given money. Thataposs because he has chosen to follow the the usual rules for MPs by relying on the register of members’ financial interests - as agreed by Labouraposs ruling NEC for the contest. It means donors only have to be named  days after they have donated raising concerns that many members will have voted by the time all the donations have been published.The shadow Brexit secretary’s major donations come from Robert Latham, a Camden Labour activist and barrister who practised at Doughty Street Chambers – like Starmer who has handed over £,.Smaller donations of £, and £, have come from Richard Hermer and Iain Simpson. The campaign has also benefited from £, worth of hotel stays kind from a firm led by Farah Sassoon whose firm provides the hotel rooms for Labour Party conference and who was once dubbed ‘Sally Bercow’s drinking pal’. The parliamentary system means a donation only needs to be published  days after it has been received. The only cash donations he declared today were accepted on January  and declared on February  -   days later. Any donations Keir Starmer received after Feb rd didn’t have to be declared today.  Her latest donations show Rebecca Long-Bailey has declared £, from Unite, a further £, from the union to cover a seconded staff member and £, for a ‘digital media consultant’. While the Momentum campaign group has given £, worth of staff time. The figures dwarf the declarations made by the other campaigns. Long-Bailey’s team say delays will mean most members have voted by the time funding is fully disclosed.  Shadow cabinet secretary Jon Trickett, who is supporting Long-Bailey and sits on the NEC, said: “By only publishing donations via the register, candidates can self-finance in order to delay accepting donations, allowing them to publish these later on. You don’t have to officially accept a donation for  days and then you don’t have to declare it for another  days, so it can be  days until it’s declared on the register, which will be after the leadership election is over.

Andhe wakes up tomorrow without having won any of the  states voting tonight, there#xs going to be some serious questions about what he#xs accomplishing in the race - and whether his extravagant ad spending would be better spent where. He#xs poured more than  million into TV, radio and digital advertising in the first Super Tuesday states. That#xs more than  times that of any other candidate. There#xs already been suggestions that he should just drop out and convert his impressive advertising team and klout into a Super PAC - a campaign group that can spend money in elections - to back Joe Biden. :Dogs in polling stations is a thing in the USTurns out it#xs not just the UK that posts pictures of dogs at polling stations.Here#xs former Calornia governor Jerry Brown voting in this #xCpawfully#xD important election.:What time do polls close on Super Tuesday So as we head to the first polls closing - and the networks starting to make their first projections - here#xs what we#x should expect from the rest of the evening.Voters in American Samoa caucused on Tuesday, polls have already closed.All of the following are UK timeVermont: Midnight Virginia: Midnight North Carolina: .am Alabama: am Maine: am Massachusetts: am Oklahoma: am Tennessee: am Texas: am - except for El Paso and Hudspeth counties, where polls close at am Arkansas: .am Colorado: am Minnesota: am Utah: am Calornia: am - but we probably won#xt see a result for a loooong time after that:Exit poll: Coronavirus a big issue in some statesAbout three out of four Democratic primary voters in four big states - Calornia, Texas, Virginia and North Carolina - said the new coronavirus was a factor in their vote on Tuesday, according to exit polls analyzed by Edison Research.In Texas, the disease was cited as a factor by % of voters, and in North Carolina by %. In Calornia, it was cited by % and in Virginia by %, the poll found.Andyou#xre able to work out which of the Democratic candidates would benefit from this, you#xre a smarter person than I.:Healthcare a huge driver of votesCNN#xs exit poll in Virginia and North Carolina found one issue driving votes like no other - healthcare.Voters named it as their top issue - with a universal option, such as Bernie Sanders#x #xCMedicare for All#xD, being the preferred option for more than half of voters.Meanwhile a majority of voters in Alabama, Maine and North Carolina said their feeling about the Trump administration was #xCangry#xD. :Exit poll: Beating Trump is biggest issue in VirginiaThe first lines from CNN#xs exit poll are coming through. They show almost half of voters in both Virginia and a third in North Carolina either made up their mind who to vote for today or in the last few days. That#xs probably good news for Joe Biden, who will benefit from Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar#xs departure from the race - and is riding on a wave of momentum after winning the South Carolina Primary. Some % of voters in Virginia said they were voting for someone who could beat Donald Trump - rather than someone who agreed with them on the issues.And % in North Carolina said beating Trump was the biggest issue. :TennesseeOne state casting votes tonight is Tennessee - where tornadoes thrashed Nashville and surrounding cities early this morning, killing  people.Apart from the public buildings set to be used for polling, schools, district offices and courts were closed.But some polling places have suffered power failures and closed - with voters redirected to other stations. That#xs led to long queues and frustrated Democrats as the evening has worn on. :The state of the race so farWith several early state already holding primaries, some of the delegates have already pledged to candidates.Bernie Sanders: Joe Biden: Pete Buttigieg: Elizabeth Warren: Amy Klobuchar: But wait, I hear you cry - Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have dropped out of the race!

Super Tuesday is the biggest night in the Primary season, where Americans get to decide who will represent their party in Novemberaposs general election . And the race to be the Democrat nominee in  is full of big characters and arguments over the future of the party. With more than a dozen states set to pick their winners on one night, the course of the entire election could change. Hereaposs everything you need to know about Super Tuesday and the state of the US election campaign.What is Super Tuesday  Super Tuesday is - as its name suggests - the biggest night of the US primary campaign. After a series of one-off primary elections in states like Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada - Tuesday night some  states and one overseas territory will go to the polls to decide on their preferred candidates for the general election. Which states are involved Alabama American SamoaArkansas Calornia Colorado Maine Massachusetts Minnesota North Carolina Oklahoma Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont VirginiaWhen will the results be in  Polls close between pm and .pm Eastern Time, which is between midnight and .am our time. American Samoa is holding a caucus, which is weird and complicated, so itaposs likely to be quite late before results come in - so while results will be dropping in throughout the night, we might not have all the numbers until  or am.  How does the primary process work  Primaries and caucuses  Before each general election, the major parties pick a candidate to run for President. This is done through an excruciatingly long process of primary elections and caucuses, which can last twice as long as the election campaign itself. Party members in each of the  states plus the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the American Virgin Islands and Guam vote for their favoured candidate in either a primary election - a regular apossecret ballotapos style election held across the state - or a caucus, where party members express their preferences more publicly in school halls and community centres. On Super Tuesday, Alaska, Colorado, Minnesota and Wyoming are deciding their nominations with caucuses. Delegates Each state has a certain number of delegates at the partyaposs National Convention, decided by party based on the population of the state. These delegates are awarded to presidential candidates based either on a winner take all principle, or proportionally based on vote share. Superdelegates Just to make it even more confusing, there are a certain number of delegates from each state who can pledge to whichever candidate they like. They tend to be office holders, ex-presidents, members of congress, committee members and state chairs. The Conventions  The end of primary season, and the beginning of the election proper is marked by each partyaposs National Convention. These are similar to party conferences in this country, but on a much grander scale. The multi-day, stadium-sized events are filled with speeches from party grandees, congressmen and presidential candidates. The Conventions build up to an often dramatic floor vote, which decides which candidate the party will nominate for the presidential race. Why does Super Tuesday matter  Itaposs got the potential to make or break candidates for the presidency. Democratic candidates need  delegates to ensure a win, and a third of those are available on Super Tuesday. Which states are the most important  Texas and Calornia are the big ones. The lone star state has a whopping  delegates available for the Democrats. Calornia - taking part in Super Tuesday for the first time - has . Candidates will be playing for them in a big way.

The conservationist argues it’s “unlawful” because the decision to go ahead relied on the Government-commissioned Oakervee review process, which did not take into account the full environmental costs. Mr Packham said the review is “compromised, incomplete and flawed”.He said: “In the year of COP , it’s time for Boris Johnson to be held accountable. For now, we have won on Heathrow.The climate impact of HS is incompatible with any Net Zero Emissions target and will allow the large-scale expansion of airports instead of Heathrow. We must not allow HS to be Boris’ fast-track to expanding aviation where in the UK. “Our government has failed. I believe the review central to the mandate to proceed was seriously flawed in its methods. I believe that essential submissions regarding environmental concerns were ignored by the review . “As a consequence, the Oakervee review is compromised, incomplete and flawed and thus the decision to proceed based upon it is unlawful. “Today some of us are making a last stand for nature and the environment and we will not go quietly into any good night.” The Springwatch presenter believes that HS will damage or destroy almost  wildle sites, including over  Ancient Woodlands, and the climate impact of HS is expected to be incompatible with any Net Zero emissions target because the line will facilitate the large-scale expansion of airports across the UK.

The Monarch wore a pair of white gloves, which also covered her wrist, as she shook hands with a number of people after handing over medals at Buckingham Palace today. She usually hands out the honours without gloves, as she carries out the fiddly task of fastening the awards to a hook on the recipientsapos lapels. She regularly wears them while out and about on public engagements, but this is believed to be the first time sheaposs had them on at an investiture. Buckingham Palace refused to comment, but a palace source told the Mirror the Queen and Palace staff would follow Government advice. The last time the Queen wore gloves for an investiture was when she knighted Air Mashall Claude Pelly, Commander in Chief of the RAF Middle East Air Force in . Among the well-deserving people handed awards today were Harry Billinge from St Austell, who was made an MBE, actress Wendy Craig, who got a CBE. The Queenaposs grandson Prince William and his we Kate have opted not to wear gloves for the first engagement of their three-day visit to Ireland.

The terrying incident happened when Faheem Mohammed, , was confronted by a group of hooded yobs, some of whom were armed, in Longton Hall Road, Stoke-on-Trent. The dad-of-one had been walking his dog near his home in Blurton at the time, and ran for his le when the men emerged from six cars, he claimed. When he managed to get inside his house, he says the attackers, one of them wearing a balaclava, rammed one of their cars into his gate while making threats against his family. Six cars pulled up at the side of me and men got out carrying baseball bats. My instinct kicked in and I ran to my house. I ran for my le, he told Stoke-on-Trent Live.  The group of lads chased me to my address in Blurton with weapons and were doing everything to try to get in the house. They all had their hoods up and one was wearing a balaclava.  But the quick-thinking dad - whose we has recently undergone brain surgery and was inside at the time - says he managed to scare the attackers off with an ornamental samurai sword. I was able to get in and get my ornamental samurai sword which I was swinging to scare them off and keep them away from my house where my partner Jade Stonier and my six-year-old son were inside, he continued. Jade is just recovering from brain surgery as well.  If I didnapost have that sword then something bad would definitely have happened. A neighbour also came out and tried to help me as much as he could. It was very scary. They were shouting saying they were going to run through my house and I did everything I could to protect my family. They said they were going to smash up the house and do bad things to my child and partner. They even rammed one of the cars into my gate to try to get in and it has smashed part of the wall. Staffordshire Police have released footage of the incident, and any witnesses are asked to get in touch. Two arrests have been made so far as officers continue to investigate. Mr Mohammed, who says vandals have smashed his propertyaposs windows on three previous occasions, says the attack has left his family scared in our own home. If I hadnapost made it home I would be in hospital. Weaposre scared in our own home now but I wonapost let them win by moving, he said. There needs to be a criminal sentence for these people. It was a traumatising experience, it was just horrible. Itaposs disgusting what they did, but I just did everything I could to keep them out. A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: Officers were called to reports of several men in the area with weapons.

The -year-old woman was held as a slave by cruel Rita Jablonskaite and her partner Robertas Repsas - who also organised the smuggling of the desperate, homeless man. Both victims were trafficked from Lithuania and were forced to work at the home of Jablonskaite, , and Repsas, , for no money. Often the victims were fed just one small meal a day, with the woman saying she would sometimes feel so starved, she would cry. Detectives were only initially alerted after the trafficked man found a discarded mobile phone at his masteraposs home, and managed to top it up with cash found in rubbish at a nearby glass recycling plant, where he also worked.The -year-old desperately called the Lithuanian embassy before police became involved, reports the Liverpool Echo .The woman was then also eventually freed from her invisible handcuffs after scribbling a message asking for help on a piece of police paperwork when officers visited the home as part of their investigation. When officers attended the Warrington address in March , they discovered the manaposs accommodation was a mattress in a cupboard under the stairs at Jablonskaite and Repsasapos home. He had been cleaning and gardening and, from November , had also worked full time for a recycling company, but he never received the wages, Liverpool Crown Court heard. The victim came to Warrington in a mini-bus in June  and had been made to work as a domestic servant. He referred to Jablonskaite and Repsas as his owners. It later emerged he was homeless in Lithuania and had been approached by a man there, who offered him the chance to live and work in the UK with a Lithuanian family. He was told heaposd be required to clean the house in exchange for food, accommodation and cigarettes and when he arrived he would be given £ upfront and a phone.  The female victim, , told police how she was approached in Lithuania by Jablonskaiteaposs father who said she could earn money by working for his daughter’s cleaning firm in the UK. She also travelled to the UK in a shuttle bus and was left outside the defendant’s home which was then in Westland Drive, in the early hours of the morning. The woman was made to clean and look after the defendant’s young daughter. There was no bed for her and she was forced to sleep on the sofa in the living room. She was often given just one meal a day and spoke of being so hungry sometimes that she cried. Jablonskaite and Repsas were today jailed for  months and  months respectively. She admitted three counts of arranging or facilitating the travel of another person with a view to exploitation while Repsas pleaded guilty to one count of the same offence.  They were prosecuted under the Modern Slavery Act at Liverpool Crown Court. The female victim was only discovered five months after police first arrested Repsas and Jablonskaite. Nicola Wyn Williams, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Repsas and Jablonskaite trafficked vulnerable people to this country, by deceiving them that they would get paid work in the UK and improve their lives. The opposite was the case. “They were used as slaves by the defendants who removed their ID documents and took total control over their money, their bank accounts and their lives. “The victims couldn’t leave the house without asking permission and had no way of breaking free and raising the alarm. Repsas and Jablonskaite had made both victims totally dependent on them.

Trapped on the island of Lesbos that has become their prison, the family who fled the Taliban watch as the promise of freedom escapes their grasp in a charge of riot shields and rubber batons. In the pretty harbour of Mytilini, the island’s capital, refugees from war-torn nations such as Syria and Afghanistan are being rounded up to ensure they do not get any further into Europe. Ripped off by people-smugglers in Turkey who charged them £, for an illegal three-hour journey across the Aegean Sea in an inflatable dinghy, they have now been tricked again. As the stand-off simmers, officers force hundreds of refugees on to buses to be taken back to a camp where around , people live in squalor, unable to move forward or go back. Davood, , says he has been waiting seven months to get his family to the Greek mainland. Conned into believing Turkey’s promise last week that Europe’s borders would be open, the wait goes on. His sons Ati, four, and Mohammad, two, are in poor health and exhausted. Davood says: “We left Afghanistan for our safety a year ago. We left because my two brothers were killed by the Taliban. “For a month we walked through Iran then Turkey. Imagine that with two kids. Their whole lives have been horrible. “All the money we have, after giving our savings to the smugglers, is the cost of a ferry ticket to Athens. But they won’t allow us to go there. They won’t give us the stamp on our asylum forms.”Davood adds: “We all came today because we had been told they were letting people on the ferries. Instead we are being herded by police. “We came here to escape the Taliban, now the Greek police are coming at us.” Davood, a farmer in his home village near Herat, and Tawos, , left Afghanistan to work and get their lads into school, without the daily threat of terror attacks and torture. As they herded migrants through the harbour, the officers shouted in English: “Move, move – no papers to Athens.” Greece’s government is forcibly repelling migrants trying to get in, and they are doing their utmost to deter families from staying. The angry scenes in Mytilini were played out in front of British Border Force ship HMC Valiant, in Lesbos to help with the European effort to stem the flow of illegal immigration.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/SMac_Demi_McMahon_Love_Show_Dundee-4-scaled.jpg ","title":"dundee performer demi looking to meet the one on quirky musical dating show","story":"These days, most people meet #the one# online or through a dating app.But what about finding the love of your le through the power of song That#s exactly what -year-old Demi Mcmahon, from Menzieshill, was looking for when she submitted an application to take part in BBC Scotland#s latest dating show.Love Song, hosted by DJ Arielle Free, hopes to ditch #profiles# and #likes# and use the ultimate tried and tested #ice-breaker# to help people find their one true love – singing.Repost from my music pageI can now tell everyone #.I am singing on a Brand new T.V show !!.. 😍😀 and that#Posted by Demi Mcmahon onWednesday,  February Contestants will belt out a tune as they take to the stage with three co-singers.

We need to move forward with the modern trends of the game.“There’s needs to be a balance of letting kids express themselves and being free at certain points but also hammering home the technical and tactical elements of their game.”Of the environment at Tannadice, Courts added: “The club’s invested quite heavily in additional staff members like ourselves but also video analysis and physical performance.“We look at the full player as an athlete, first and foremost, but it’s all in collaboration with the technical, tactical and physical performance.“It’s a club on an upward trajectory again and they’ve got a phenomenal reputation historically for developing young players.“There’s a blueprint and something ingrained within the club. The calibre of people you are working with on a daily basis is great.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself. Anyone  in the category absolutely deserved to win, so it really is an honour.#Throughout high school, Josh was a victim of bullying, struggling to understand who he was as a person and confused by his own thoughts and feelings.

It wasn#t until moving to Glasgow and being more involved with the LGBTQ+ community he gained a better understanding of himself and being transgender.Returning home to Lochgilphead, Josh came out as transgender, ultimately finding his true self.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield stands has been supported by two Scottish rugby legends.Former Melrose

He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do

to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid

annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo. Beria is trying tae stop spring and the rule orsquo Queen Bride. And we still hae the three days orsquo snaw tae come, but ater that Beria will huv tae flee.ldquoWhy didnrsquot they kill Beria, then itrsquoll be summer all the time  asked one of the older children.The gran smiled. ldquoAngus was Beriarsquos son. They were all related, just like the seasons, although they fought each other for a place they all needed each other and were part of the same family.ldquoJust like us.ldquoAye.ldquoGran, can we have more hot chocolate and can you tell us the other stories about Beria  asked a grandchild.ldquoOrsquo course, said the gran, ldquobut we wud need a hale winter tae tell arsquo the stories aboot her.

People can turn up, work and provide a passport of their EU driving licence and that will not have any implications for the rest of the UK.ldquoWe have another open border with the Republic of Ireland, and we operate a common travel area. There is no reason why that canrsquot happen with Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East added that the policy could create a ldquobig danger in terms of exploitation of workers.He explained: ldquo The big danger and potential cause of illegal work and trafficking iswe have a system in place where demand for workers is not being met.ldquoThat is the danger of what the UK government has announced in recent weeks.ldquoThe demand for people to work in agriculture or lower paid jobs is not going to be met now. there will be people willing to fill that gap through trafficking or exploitation, illegal working.The Fragomen report states ldquoany regional policy iations on the governmentrsquos proposed system would not open a ldquoback door for illegal immigration to other parts of the UK.It adds: ldquoWe reject arguments that free movement in Scotland, or perhaps any regional flexibilities, would create a back door to the wider UK labour market...The government is already relying on in-country controls to prevent any abuse, for instance right to work checks, whether relating to visa free travel from the US and where, or through the borderless common travel area with Ireland.ldquoThe government could rely on those same checks for migrants moving from Scottish free movement to a UK immigration system. Concerns that this will create a back door do not stack up, when the UKrsquos front door is wide open.It also suggests lowering the pound, salary threshold for workers coming to Scotland, creating a separate Migration Advisory Committee,three-year post-study work visas and waiving the fees for NHS visa applications.It comes after business leaders warned up to a fth of Scottish firms may be forced to close under the plans, while others said they were completely unprepared and had no clue how they would recruit enough staff.The agriculture, fishing, tourism and care sectors are thought to be worst affected by the proposals, as well as rural areas where, experts say, there are barely any jobs with salaries over the threshold required for a visa.A Home Office spokesman said: ldquoThe UK Points-Based Immigration System makes sure that everyone working in this country can prove that they have the right to be in the UK. This will help to identy iniduals being exploited and we remain absolutely committed disrupting criminal traffickers and unscrupulous employers.Our new Points-Based Immigration System will work in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom.

Initially, it consisted of a single layer of gauze which at first proved somewhat ineffective in preventing surgical wound sepsis, until a second layer was added to create more separation between the mask and the mouth.They developed from there Over time, advances were made in the field, with further research seeing design changes that made masks more efficient, including making them bigger, the inclusion of filters and the integration of antibiotics or antiviral coatings to increase protection.One thing remains the same The ear-loop design that holds it in place has remained the same through the generations.They were already popular in Asian countries The practice of wearing face masks began in Japan during the early th century during the global Spanish flu pandemic that killed around  million people. Covering faces with scarves and veils became common practice and then, after an earthquake in  in Japan, face masks were again worn to protect against ash and smoke in the air.In Chinese medicine, breathing is also seen as key to maintaining good \"qi\" ndash positive energy - in the body, perhaps encouraging their wear.But do they work There is a long-standing debate over how effective they are, with key factors including the material used, how often they are changed andthey are worn correctly. Experts have also warned that the Covid- virus could even enter the body through the eyes, which most masks do not cover. Public Health England also said that ldquoAlthough there is a perception that the wearing of facemasks may be beneficial, there is in fact very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use outside of these clinical settings.\"However Sales are rocketing as anxious consumers buy so many of them, prices are surging and counterfeit products are surfacing online.

Itrsquos that containment measures and closures ndash should they prove necessary ndash create practical headaches, too shutting a school, for example, will almost certainly take out of action a lot of healthcare workers, as would public transport restrictions.If it turns out that widespread ldquoself-isolation becomes necessary, it will obviously have a huge impact on such frontline services, and on sectors such as retail, logistics and hospitality.A lot of other parts of the economy, however, may be surprisingly resilient. Itrsquos dficult to find out how many of those employed in the UK would be ableto work from home, but itrsquos likely to be a fair number. Most people who spend the majority of their time on a computer and telephone ndash which must be a signicant proportion of the workforce ndash could as easily do that at home.Managers, professionals, administrative and secretarial workers are more than  per cent of all those employed not all of them will be able to do everything remotely, but five years ago, more than  per cent of the UK workforceworked almost exclusively from home. At that stage, it was estimated that half the UK workforce would work remotely by .That obviously isnrsquot the case, and I donrsquot suppose that anyone would regard it as a vindication of the predictionit were to happen this year, but only as a result of a pandemic that had us all quarantined in our bedrooms, checking in with the office on Skype, Slack or Microsoft Teams.But given we have such tools for security, video-conferencing, multi-user messaging and real-time supervision, itrsquos rather odd that ldquotelecommuting hasnrsquot become the default for more jobs. With the exception of a few industries, remote working tends to be something that, for those who do it at all, is confined to a day or two a week, rather than the norm.Yet, as well as the obvious savings for employers in providing office space, as well as ancillary costs , all the research suggests that those who work mainly from home are more productive, motivated and happier. The advantages arenrsquot just flexibility in work le balance or quality of living there are real material advantages in commuting and housing costs ndash especially for those who live outside major cities.We should be using the necessity for such measures during our current dficulties to overcome the resistance to introducing this kind of model much more widely. Think, for example, of the boon for meeting climate targets,we could take a few million daily commuters out of the equation, and the likely geographical redistribution of skilled work and income.Imagine the savings in care costs that would be produced with a more flexible workforce, the boost to small businesses and local high streetspeople popped out from home, on foot or by bicycle, for their errands, rather than concentrating their spending around office blocks in city centres.If it comes to that, it could have a profound impact on housing, one of the great distortions in the economy, by allowing the repurposing of city centre offices for accommodation, while offering those who prefer the country or the suburbs the ability to work there instead.

This scheme could save young people and families thousands of pounds a year, and encourage whole generations of public transport users.“Buses are the backbone of local public transport and the key to employment and training opportunities for so many of those starting out in le.”He added: “Since the  election the Scottish Greens have pushed the Scottish Government to provide councils with a fairer share of funding.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm. Tickets are priced at £. and are available online at www.eventbrite"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March .

But I am looking forward to testing for myself the theory that Guinness tastes even better in Ireland than overseas.”During the reception William and Kate, in a dazzling emerald green dress by The Vampire’s We, were introduced to groups of guests, from film and TV, sports, sustainability and environment, creative and cultural Ireland, education and research, the charity sector and unormed services.They included Game Of Thrones star Liam Cunningham, who played Davos Seaworth in the HBO series and Misfits actor Robert Sheehan, comedian Deirdre O’Kane and actors Sarah Bolger and Orla Brady.Speaking afterwards, Cunningham said he had met the duke before at an after-party for the Warhorse premiere at Buckingham Palace. vw,vw,px, px\"The Duchess of Cambridge at a reception hosted by the British Ambassador to Ireland “They are total sweethearts,” he said of the couple.“They are gorgeous, they are beautul people.

At the beginning of February the Derry News reported that Derry City  Strabane District Council expected Stormont to announce poundm of City Deal match funding within weeks. A formal announcement has not yet been made. The council also indicated that negotiations were ongoing with the NI government to secure an additional poundm to match the total UK Governmentpackage of poundm towards a Derry City and Strabane Region Deal. Now, a Department of Finance spokesperson has said Sinn Feacutein minister Conor Murphy supports match funding. googletag.cmd.push The spokesperson stated: “The Minister will be taking a paper to the Executive seeking its agreement to match funding for City Deals. “As the Minister has expressed his support for Match Funding for Inclusive Future Funds this will also be included as a recommendation in the paper.” The current package, pound million for the City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund, aims to boost the economic potential of the city and support a more prosperous and united community. The Derry City and Strabane City Deal investment will help strengthen innovation and the digital potential of the city region and unlock local partner funding. googletag.cmd.push It will be bolstered by a poundm Inclusive Future Fund aimed at bringing greater prosperity and social benefits to the whole of the community. Ulster University will be granted poundm of the pound already committed. Official council documents indicate it may be given additional funds. UU’s poundm will be invested in centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automation , the Graduate Entry Medical Schooland Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence . Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson has welcomed Finance Minister Conor Murphy’s support for Executive funding towards Derry’s pound million City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. She said: “Together, The City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund represent a pound million investment in the North West which will provide a major and much-needed economic boost to the entire region, helping us to create and sustain well-paying jobs and opportunities. “Derry’s City Deal was always contingent on the Executive match funding the British Government’s contribution, but the Executive must also decide whether to take a similar approach to the Future Fund. “Therefore, I very much welcome that Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy has now confirmed in an Assembly answer to me that he supports match-funding both and will shortly be bringing the matter to the Executive. “That is another example of the positive approach that Sinn Feacutein takes to government, helping to deliver investment, regeneration and opportunity where it is needed.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin was speaking after details were published of locations visited by potential inward investors to Northern Ireland hosted by Invest NI. In the   year, there were  visitsto Belfast, compared to just sixin the Foyle constituency and a meagre two visits in East Derry. Invest NI is Northern Irelands regional economic development agency. It is a non-departmental public body of the Department for the Economy . googletag.cmd.push According to its own website its role is to grow the local economy. “We do this by helping new and existing businesses to compete internationally, and by attracting new investment to Northern Ireland,” it adds. The agency has come in for harsh criticism from Derry representatives in recent weeks after attending a Derry City  Strabane District Council meeting where it was branded “Invest Belfast” and taken to task for failing to promote the North West to potential investors. Just days later, at a Department for the Economy Committee meeting with Invest NI, DUP MLA Christopher Stalford accused Sinead McLaughlin of engaging in the “politics of envy” when she insisted that a sub-regional strategy was needed to address “disparities” across the country. googletag.cmd.push Following the publication of statistics that show almost % of Invest NI visits are to Belfast locations, SDLP Economy Spokesperson Sinead McLaughlin MLA has sought an urgent meeting with Diane Dodds, Economy Minister. The Foyle MLA said: “The focus on Belfast from Invest NI will not be a surprise to many, but the statistics released recently are particularly damning, with almost % of potential investor visits limited to Belfast. “These statistics are only confirmation of what we already know and understand about where investment goes. “It is their mantra that they do not promote one place more over another. If Foreign Direct Investorsland in Belfast and are not taken anywhere  then it is indicative of only promoting one place.”  Skills deficit  Northern Ireland’s skills deficit, she says, is closely linked to its geography, with the strongest skills based in and around Belfast – whereas areas West of the Bann have some of the highest proportions of adults with no qualications, analysis of an NI Assembly briefing document has shown. Almost half the adult population of West Tyrone – % - have no qualications. Other areas with a high proportion of adults without qualications at level  or above include Mid-Ulster , Fermanagh and South Tyrone , Upper Bann , and Newry and Armagh . The Foyle MLA went on to say that sub-regional targets must be written into law and incentives put in place to ensure that investment is spread across the country. “If we keep on doing what we are doing we are going to get the same results, it is fundamentally wrong. People can’t keep on using the same old excuses for regional disparities. “Northern Ireland’s skills deficit is closely linked to its geography, with the strongest skills based in and around Belfast – while the areas West of the Bann have some of the highest proportions of adults with no qualications, analysis of official statistics reveals. “I have written to Minister Dodds to seek an urgent meeting where I will press for inclusion of sub regional investment targets in the new Economy Strategy.” Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson asked the Minister for the Economy whether she plans to set targets for Invest NI to ensure future jobs are located in Foyle. Diane Dodds, DUP MLA, said: “All targets within the extant Invest NI Business Strategy - are on a regional i.e. Northern Ireland wide basis. “Invest NI supports Councils to drive economic development in their area. Each Council has its own Community Plan, with targets for investment and growth. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has set a target of , jobs by . Invest NI’s support for businesses in the region will contribute towards this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

His performance will give manager Declan Devine something to think about ahead of this week’s game against Waterford, and Mallon admitted that the opportunity to prove himself on the pitch drives him every day.“In the first game I didn’t start but I kept my head,” he explained. “I’ve had times before, playing Us, when I haven’t been picked and I’ve thrown my head, but tonight was a chance to prove that I’ve changed and I’ve matured and that I am going to work hard every day. Decky put his faith in me and the goal was an unbelievable feeling.”Mallon was a threat for Derry City throughout Friday’s game and was involved in a fascinating battle with Bohs defender Michael Barker, a battle he eventually won.“I play to my strengths, I get the ball and knock it down the line and use my pace and get crosses in,” he explained. “I think he started to read that and that’s why, on the goal, I came inside to go back out. “It was an unbelievable feeling running over to the fans in the corner. My body was numb, it was an unreal feeling and to have my family in that corner as well was unbelievable.”The importance of getting the first win of the season was not lost on anyone at the club, but Mallon insists that neither he nor his team mates are getting carried away.“We’ve had two hard games,” he acknowledged. “We went to Dundalk and put in a good performance and were unlucky and Finn Harps I think we could have come away from that game with two more points, but it’s moments like this when you have to dig deep and keep on going. We always thought we could win this game, but it is only one game. We have four points on the board and we go into next week with the same attitude because we want to get another three points and get to the top end of the table.“The next game is a big game so hopefully we can go down there, give % and come away with the three points. googletag.cmd.push ‘No pats on the back’Meanwhile, Declan Devine has got one of his pre-season wishes as his team beat one of the top three at last, but he is not celebrating too much.“I want to beat them again,” he stated. “There’s no pats on the back. We’ve done it once, we have to play them another three times, we have to play Dundalk another three times and we have to play Shamrock Rovers four times. “It’s a good start doing that but for me this was all about character. “The boys took a few digs last week, with a few people saying things that I felt hard done by, but that’s the nature of it. We have to remember that when we came into this club they were th in the league having lost  league games, the crowds were down to - people. “People quickly forget, but we have to understand that this is the nature of the job. “The support we received was honestly unreal the singing and the backing the players received, that’s everything, that was important as the performance on the pitch.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Beginning this evening. to pm, the Sion Mills club want to bring Aikido to the North West, a Japanese martial art originally from a type of jiu jitsu, that has been relatively unheard of in the city. Chief Instructor Tom Campbell and his son Gavin are looking to encourage people that wouldn’t typically think of martial arts as a new hobby or sport to give Aikido a go, unlike other martial arts Gavin says you don’t need to be big and strong to take it up. “It’s relatively new, he explained. It only developed after the second world war to show people the correct path instead of karate or judo that would typically have an emphasis on competition and aggression.”Ki-Shin-Tai are looking for adult beginners of all ages and backgrounds to join the class for the martial art based on the idea that anyone can do it. Gavin explains aikido is unique in that, “it is purely self defence, non aggressive and based on a dferent philosophy of peace and well being.” Ki-Shin-Tai Aikido Club has been primarily based in Sion Mills and has been getting stronger over  years. Gavin’s father Tom has been training for  years. “He is the chief instructor and began training in Belfast to learn Aikido because that’s the only place you could learn then, stayed with it and started the club.”Not just for improving your health or finding a new hobby, Gavin has said it has done much more for him personally. “It’s great for dferent aspects of your le, fitness, self improvement, concentration and stress relief. Its good for your physical health and your mental health, to have to have a hobby that’s constructive and relaxed.”Although there have been some classes in the North West it has been underrepresented and can offer much more to people that wouldn’t be interested in a competitive or aggressive martial art to get involved. “The Foyle arena is a great venue for it just for it to become more popular get the word out there.”Ki-Shin-Tai Aikido’s weekly adult class begins this Wednesday at .pm in the Foyle Arena.

In a race won by either Willie Mullins or Nicky Henderson in four of the last five years, the Champion Hurdle crown is usually reserved for the powerful yards. Since , only three other trainers have had the winner of the race, including last years surprise winner, Gavin Cromwell. He broke the hold of Henderson and Mullins, and amazingly, could actually win again this year with DARVER STAR . googletag.cmd.push Espoir DAllen was a shock winner last year and Darver Star would be an equally novel name for the winners enclosure after an unconventional road to the race. He picked up his first win in a handicap hurdle at Wexford in April last year after five unsuccessful trips to the track before that. He was rated  in that Wexford race but has had a meteoric rise since then. Hes won four times in the intervening period, including a listed race in Limerick last October, but it is his performances in defeat in graded company that catch the eye most of all. googletag.cmd.push After his fourth win on the spin, he went up against Ballymore favourite Envoi Allen at Fairyhouse in December. He was a   outsider but admirably finished just four s behind Envoi Allen and just over two s behind the second-placed horse, Abacadabras, one of the market leaders for the Supreme Novices Hurdle on Tuesday. That was good enough form but may have been written off as a flukeDarver Star didnt follow it up with something similar. He did just that and probably surpassed that display by running Honeysuckle very close at Leopardstown last month. He was slow enough to get into stride but after the last, he was gaining ground on Henry De Bromheads star and market principle in the Mares Hurdle all the way to the line. He was denied by half abut beat the likes of Petit Mouchoir and Supasundae in the process. Beating those types will do his chances no harm and the slightly extended trip in the Champion Hurdle will see him to good effect, especiallythe ground comes up soft to slow a few others down. At   in places, Darver Star is a brilliant each-way price and would ba fairytale story for his Louth owners. Elsewhere, but at slightly less favourable eachway prices, Cilaos Emery  has a shout for Willie Mullins. He has been supplemented for the race and would lap it upit came up very soft. He fell in a chase won by Chacun Pour Soi at Leopardstown earlier this year but appeared to get a new spark when reverted to hurdles on February . He beat Darasso by nine s on heavy ground, prompting connections to steer him towards the Champion Hurdle. He too would be suited by a stf test and may well outlast quite a few up the hill. Wednesday, March  - Ballymore Novices Chase The word banker is thrown around far too often in the lead-up to Cheltenham but ENVOI ALLEN  is as close to one as youre likely to get heading over from Ireland his year. Hes leading the market in the Supreme Novices Hurdle on Day  but trainer Gordon Elliott has made it clear thisis the race hell tackle. He beat a horse called Nearly Perfect in a point-to-point two years ago, but aptly, he has been absolutely perfect ever since, winning seven straight races to remain unbeaten. The fact that hes won so many races on the bounce is good enough reason to back him here but the manner of the victories is even more telling. He beat Abacadabras easily in December and in his first run in , he eased to victory over Elixer DAinay and Longhouse Poet without so much as a reminder from the whip. He is very classy and will enjoy this M F trip on soft ground. He will be a serious staying chaser in time and that pedigree will give him all he needs to bound up the hill at Cheltenham.   is a skinny enough price but this horse belongs in every Cheltenham accumulator. Friday, March  - Triumph Hurdle You need a turn of foot to win a Triumph Hurdle and based on his last run, Dan Skeltons ALLMANKIND  fits that bill perfectly. He was a fair performer on the flat last year but has been revitalised over hurdles this term. He won by  s on his debut over timber at Warwick last November and followed that up with a two and a half- victory in a Triumph Hurdle trial at Cheltenham later that month. There was even more to like about his nine- victory over Cerberus at Chepstow over Christmas where he led from start to finish under a confident ride by Harry Skelton. It was reminiscent on Our Conors runaway victory in the  Triumph when he streaked clear early and just kept the foot down to win by  s. Allmankinds sectional times were outstanding at Chepstow, especially when you consider the state of the ground. He clearly stays well, as evidenced by that win on heavy ground, and he also has the course form at Cheltenham in the bank. With the ground likely to turn towards the heavy side before Friday at Cheltenham, he could well bounce out and burn off his rivals before halfway. Friday, March  - Gold Cup This year gives us an ultra-competitive renewal of the Gold Cup with last years winner Al Boum Photo ing and challenging for market favouritism with Santini. In a race his trainer reckons hes made for, Im siding with DELTA WORK  for Gordon Elliott. He was involved in the race of the festival last year, alongside current favourite Santini and Topofthegame who wont line up here. That was in the RSA Chase where two s covered the first three home. Delta Work is a serious operator and has looked the real deal over three miles this year against the big boys. He has twice beaten Punchestown Gold Cup winner and Al Boum Photo conqueror Kemboy, who briefly led the market for this race late last year. Gordon Elliott is very sweet on Delta Work and describes him as the forgotten horse because he hasnt captured the publics attention quite like Samcro, Tiger Roll or even current hype horse, Envoi Allen. That is slightly surprising given the fact he has won nine of his  racecourse starts. Hes only finished outside the front three on two of those occasions. His running style will suit this race with a repeat of his Irish Gold Cup success last month likely to bring him very close. He settled in th or th that day and jumped well. He seems to switch off and run comfortably in the early part of races before being produced late. If he does hit the lead, it is likely to be after the last when hell hope to pass his rivals up the hill. Suggestions he didnt stay in the RSA have been firmly put to bed this season. He could be a star in the making for the already star-studded Gordon Elliott yard.  horses worth backing at Cheltenham: Darver Star- Champion Hurdle  Cilaos Emery- Champion Hurdle  Envoi Allen- Ballymore Hurdle  Allmankind- Triumph Hurdle  Delta Work- Gold Gup  ALSO - Paddy Rogers reaction to winning the Ulster boxing title  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead.

In these opening minutes, BRA did enjoy a sustained period of play in Down High territory, but the home town defence was watertight.Back at the other end Ben Gibson was unlucky not to get points when he was adjudged to have been held up over the line after a period of play close the BRA line.Finally, around  minutes into the half, the pressure turned into points with Joe Charles driving over from short range for an unconverted try.It was the second half before Down High added to their tally. This time the pack provided the  with a very convincing driven maul.Having driven towards the BRA line at great pace, the referee felt the BRA infringement to stop the maul was so stark that he marched under the posts, awarding Down a penalty try to take the score line to -.With a reasonable buffer, the local lads did lt their foot a little off the gas.A few BRA replacements made a big impact and in a relatively short space of time the North Belfast outfit had scored two converted tries, giving them a - lead.With  minutes to go, Down, now chasing the game, had to produce something special. And that they did.Winger Jonathan Graham was the player to touch down, reaching out to score on the back of some great work in the maul by the dominant Down pack.The conversion attempt from out wide fell short leaving Down with a slender - lead and around six minutes of play left.The closing exchanges were tense with BRA making their way into Down territory on a few occasions, but a few vital pieces of defensive play saved the day, one of these being a crucial turnover from replacement David Corrie.The refereersquos final whistle on the back of a BRA knock-on was greatly welcomed by the large home support.Down have now drawn Bangor Grammar in the semi-finals mdash a side they have both beaten and lost to earlier in the season.Down High School Belfast Royal Academy SUBSIDIARY SHIELD Q FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Legislation.jpg","title":"Legislation welcomed on review of road running  ","story":"A REVIEW of controversial legislation governing road running events has been welcomed by two local politicians.The Department of Infrastructure is to review new rules which place a financial hurdle in the way of running and other sports clubs organising events on public roads which have to be closed, hitting them in the pocket.The new legislation governing the administration work associated with road closures to allow events to take place in safety left organisers potentially paying as much as pound,, but local politicians worked with Newry, Mourne and Down Council in a bid to keep costs to a minimum.Road closure orders for events were previously free, but the new legislation removed this concession and in addition to impacting on running and sports clubs, the new law also applies to community groups organising fun days which require a section of road to be closed.The government departmentrsquos review of the new legislation has been welcomed by South Down MLA Emma Rogan and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.Ms Rogan said the legislation placed a ldquodisproportionate financial burden on road running events while Cllr Devlin hoped the review agreed by Stormont minister Nichola Mallon will lead to ldquopositive change.Ms Rogan said the new law on road closures meant that a number of road running events cannot keep up with the costs of traffic management.ldquoFewer events are applying for closure permits as a result of this change and, most recently, this affected the Dark Hedges half marathon in Antrim, she explained.The MLA added: ldquoMy Sinn Fein colleagues on the Stormont Infrastructure Committee raised the need for the legislation to be amended so this burden can be lted from organisers, particularly those of smaller events.ldquoThis one size fits all approach for road racing traffic management is impacting on local communities. I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process. I encourage all interested groups, many of whom I have worked with since my election, to take part in the review..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 MLA.jpg","title":"MLA calls for urgent action to sort Ballykinlar centre power supply  ","story":"THE provision of electricity to the new Ballykinlar Community Centre must be sorted immediately, South Down MLA Colin McGrath has urged.The SDLP man said he was unhappy at a delay in getting a supply to the council facility revealed in last weekrsquos Down Recorder.The new centre has been ready since Christmas for organisations like the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Group to use.However, a committee meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council were told that a power connection problem was holding up the occupation and predicted it could be a longterm issue.The committee heard that electricity provider, NIE Networks, was having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to work on its land to install the mains supply.The long-awaited community hub is provided through the use of a prefabricated building, previously used by NI Fire and Rescue Service, and is sited on the former Kindle Primary School grounds in the village.A temporary solution of providing power through a generator was suggested by a council officer after a proposal from Slieve Croob councillor Kathy Mason, which was seconded by Downpatrick councillor John Trainor.Mr McGrath said the community in Ballykinlar had been waiting for the facility for decades.ldquoAfter years of work and representations the hopes of locals were dashed when the old school was torn down, even though it would have been an ideal building for a community hub. However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon. This is welcome but not ideal.ldquoApparently, there are some dficulties with the Ministry of Defence in securing the correct wayleave permission toenable electricity to be brought to the building. I have written to the Ministry and to the Northern Ireland Office and asked that this situation be sorted immediately.He urged: ldquoThe community must have its proper facility and it must be able to open properly.ldquoI hope the administrative issues can be sorted and this matter brought to a swt conclusion the community enabled to have the centre it has desperately wanted and needed for so long.The MoD last week indicated its willingness to work with NIE Networks to reach an agreement.A spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks on the installation of a power supply for the community centre.ldquoThe MOD has a long relationship with the Ballykinlar area and is pleased to support the development of this centre.A spokesman for NIE Networks outlined the connection process and said that once payment had been received by the council last October, it proceeded to undertake a site inspection and started land ownership investigations.The spokesperson added: ldquoOnce we identied the owner of the land a wayleave agreement request was issued and the process is moving forward as normal. Once the wayleave agreement is in place, work to install the connection will begin.A council spokesman said: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down District Council is unable to comment on the discussions between NIE and the Ministry of Defence, but will continue to liaise with both parties to progress the completion of Ballykinlar Community Centre.ldquoRegarding a temporary supply of electricity, the council is exploring a range of temporary options to supply electricity to the centre and cannot provide a timescale at present..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Patrick.jpg","title":"Patrick leads Newcastle team to victory  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC are the new undisputed NI and Ulster senior cross-country champions.The race ed to Ulster University at Coleraine for the first time in several years on Saturday and Newcastle AC secured the title for the second grime in five years.The club won the title back in  and they were intent on stopping City of Derry from winning for the fourth year in a row.This year again the bus of lsquomaybesrsquo turned into a bus of lsquodefinitesrsquo and  runners and lsquoone hanger onrsquo set off for the north coast, or at least almost to the north coast in typical February wintry conditions.First up were the three women who travelled and it was such a shame that there wasnrsquot a fourth runner, for surely the women would have been destined for senior team medalsthey could only have found one more volunteer con.Shalene McMurray is notorious for her fast starts, but she settled in sensibly into the pack early on.The women had three times of the k lap that included a bit of climbing along with mud, mud and more mud mdash hardly any firm going on the course at all plus a gale that would cut anyone in two mdash tough conditions where only the tough would prevail.Emma Mitchell, these days running for Clonlfe Harriers, pulled away and won with relative ease in :.

The Minister will be aware of incidents in my own community. Why have the Government not yet proscribed these organisations, and what steps will they take to review the situation urgently And I asked Home Office ministers why we should trust them over deportation flights when there are serious unresolved concerns about the Windrush scandal and wider detention and deportation policies.I said: ldquoThe Minister is asking us to trust a Department and system that have had repeated and costly failures. He admitted that the Home Office had wrongly detained  people at a cost of pound. million in compensation in just one year, -. He still refuses to give us the statistics on wrongful deportations and the associated costs.On a dferent note, it was a pleasure to welcome the Welsh Combat Regiments to Parliament this week for an annual reception.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
