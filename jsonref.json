This was nothing more than a failure to remove a diagnostic function after development.\u0027The issues were identified by independent security testing, initiated by Vodafone as part of our routine security measures, and fixed at the time by Huawei.\u0027The Chinese firm is at the centre of a debate about the company\u0027s trustworthiness and whether it should be used at the centre of communications network infrastructure.It was reportedly given the green light by Prime Minister Theresa May to be used in non-essential parts of the UK\u0027s upcoming 5G network.         In the US, the use of certain Huawei equipment is already banned on security grounds and the UK is now being pressured to take a similar approach       Earlier this year founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei (pictured with China´s President Xi Jinping), said the company had never been asked to share \u0027improper information\u0027 Huawei has been the subject of concern for some years because of allegations of close ties to the country\u0027s government.Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to \u0027support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work\u0027.A deputy assistant secretary at the US State Department, Robert Strayer, said on Monday that Huawei \u0027was not a trusted vendor\u0027 and any use of its technology in 5G networks was a risk.And his position was backed by a Conservative member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Bob Seely, who said: \u0027Huawei cannot, by definition, be a trusted vendor. It is required by law to co-operate with Chinese secret services. It is close to, if not part of, the Chinese state.\u0027China has achieved great things, and we need to respect it and develop good deep relations with it, but it also has a reputation for wholesale intellectual property theft and state hacking.         Responding to the Vodafone report, Huawei said it was made aware of historical vulnerabilities in 2011 and 2012 and they were addressed at the time         The company has denied having ties with the government and claims that it abides by the law\u0027Its military theory sees warfare as a battle between systems, including communications systems. It takes a very different approach to human rights and human freedoms.\u0027It goes without saying that to allow Huawei into our network is a risk – the question is how much.\u0027Some critics have expressed concerns that Beijing could require the firm to install technological \u0027backdoors\u0027 to enable it to spy on or disable Britain\u0027s communications network.Huawei has always denied having ties to the state and says it abides by the laws of the countries in which it operates.Founder Ren Zhengfei said earlier this year that Huawei had never been asked to share \u0027improper information\u0027 about its partners by the government.He said: \u0027I personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests. \u0027No law in China requires any company to install mandatory back doors.\u0027The US has already banned the use of some Huawei equipment on security grounds and is pressuring its allies – including the UK – to take a similar approach, warning the firm poses an \u0027unacceptable risk\u0027.In a statement on the Vodafone report, Huawei said: \u0027We were made aware of historical vulnerabilities in 2011 and 2012 and they were addressed at the time.\u0027Software vulnerabilities are an industry-wide challenge.

This was deemed to be the kindest option, whilst still being fair to all parents.\u0027Schools receive no extra funding for meals and the food, staffing costs and the running of the kitchen all have to be financed through dinner money payments.\u0027Parents are always sent a text on the day they go into debt and this will happen on a daily basis when the school is in session, until the debt is paid.\u0027Any parents who were in debt before the Easter holidays received text messages and our office manager even sent out texts on Sunday morning before we came back to school for the new term.\u0027If a child is due to be given bread and butter that day, their parents are contacted by phone to give them every opportunity to either pay, or provide a packed lunch.

Photograph: Tom Honan “People want to live in houses that are affordable, that’s something that has been a distinctive feature of Irish life and it’s something that we shouldn’t throw away too easily,” he said. “We’re not building enough council houses at the rate that we should be.”Mr Martin also said that a suggestion by the head of advocacy at Focus Ireland Mike Allen that there should be a moratorium on evictions should be examined. He said there is a case for greater engagement with landlords, but that there should not be a blanket moratorium.“There are situations where people are being evicted through no fault of their own,” the Cork TD said. “There is a case for engagement with the industry to say look, given the crisis that we are in let’s put a halt on the unnecessary eviction of people. There will always be situations where people are not paying any rent or people are being reckless as renters, we have to allow for that too, you can’t have an entirely blanket moratorium.”No prospectHe also said that there is a whole generation of Irish people who are growing up with no prospect of ever owning their own home.“Fine Gael has failed consistently over a number of years to deliver any meaningful progress on the housing situation. Rebuilding Ireland is not working.”He said that this had happened “on Fine Gael’s watch”.There has to be a significant change of direction, he said.Data from the Department of Housing published on Tuesday show there were 10,305 people homeless, including 3,821 children, in the week between March 25th and March 31st.

He claimed affordable housing had been included in the last budget because of Fianna Fáil and he was now calling for the delivery of the promised 6,000 houses.He also called on local authorities to be “freed up” to make more decisions in relation to housing, at present they are hamstrung.Mr Martin added that there are many adult offspring living with their parents who are not included in homeless figures, but they too were in effect homeless.“It’s a real crisis that demands an urgent response.”He warned that the public’s patience “is wearing thin with Fine Gael’s inability to deliver on housing or on health.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3876624.1556651284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour reaffirms policy that identifies second referendum as an option","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Jeremy Corbyn: the SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has accused the Labour leader of conspiring with “a Tory-led Brexit shambles”. Photograph:  Stefan RousseauReutersJeremy Corbyn has fought off an attempt to change Labour’s policy on Brexit by committing the party to a second referendum in all circumstances. The ruling national executive committee (NEC) agreed after a five-hour meeting on Tuesday to retain the current policy that identifies a second referendum as “an option” if Labour cannot force changes to Theresa May’s deal or trigger a general election.“Labour’s European elections manifesto was agreed at the NEC today and it will be published soon,” a party spokesman said. “The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour’s existing policy to support Labour’s alternative plan, and if we can’t get the necessary changes to the government’s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote.”Pro-Europeans led by deputy leader Tom Watson wanted the manifesto to commit Labour to putting any Brexit deal approved by MPs to a confirmatory referendum. After the meeting,some pro-European MPs claimed that the decision meant that a vote for Labour could still open the way for a second referendum.However, Gloria De Piero, a Midlands MP who insists that the outcome of the 2016 referendum must be respected, also welcomed the decision.“Labour’s manifesto for the European parliament will not contain a pledge to hold a second Brexit referendum.The party’s ruling national executive committee agreed that another nationwide poll should only be “an option” if it cannot force a general election.” The Scottish National Party (SNP), Change UK and the Liberal Democrats said the NEC’s decision showed that Labour was not committed to a second referendum. The SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, accused the Labour leader of conspiring with “a Tory-led Brexit shambles”.“Jeremy Corbyn today had an opportunity to help bring an EU referendum closer, but instead he has chosen to continue his complicity in the Tories’ plan to remove us from the EU.” Indicative votesMrs May wants talks with Labour over a common approach to Brexit to conclude by the middle of next week. If the two sides fail to agree a common approach, the government will schedule a series of indicative votes on options for Brexit, probably including a customs union and a second referendum.Two former Conservative ministers, Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, said on Tuesday that they would chair a new initiative to develop “alternative arrangements” for the Border to avoid the Northern Ireland backstop.\u0026nbspThe Alternative Arrangements Commission will seek to develop detailed proposals to avoid physical infrastructure at the Border with\u0026nbsp“comprehensive customs co-operation arrangements, facilitative arrangements and technologies” as set out in a document agreed between Britain and the EU in Strasbourg in March.The commission said it had engaged a technical panel of border and customs experts, practitioners and lawyers with detailed knowledge of trade, business and community relationships in Ireland, as well as EU, UK and international trade regulations.“Nine working groups have been created covering topics including the Border and the movement of people in the context of the Good Friday agreement, tax, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, small traders and trusted trader schemes,” the commission said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignPrince Harry announces surprise trip to the Netherlands next week - with Baby Sussex due any daySchools criticised for locking toilets during class time to stop children skipping lessonsFemale bodies found in a freezer in east London may not be identified for a week as police given more time to question suspectComment: Venezuela exposes just how far the Left will go to deny the true horrors of socialismBritish documents reignite rumours of rift between Japan\u0026#39s new emperor and his brotherLocal elections 2019: What time do the polls open tomorrow and when will we know the results?Brexit latest news: Labour  indicates deal on a customs union is closePensioners playing video games more than ever thanks to smartphonesMueller accuses Barr of creating \u0026#39public confusion\u0026#39 with inaccurate summary of his Trump reportComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s latest anti-Semitism scandal will change nothing, because to Labour members it\u0026#39s all a conspiracyJulian Assange jailed for 50 weeks for going into hiding as judge reveals his asylum cost UK taxpayer £16mComment: Maduro is fast running out of friends.

This is the equivalent of driving 14 miles in a car or charging a smartphone 732 times.They worked out that a slow roasted lamb burger with rosemary salt, brioche and wedges produces 4.53kg in emissions - largely because of the methane released by sheep.The average Brit produces around 9kg of emissions a day a day through eating and drinking, depending on their diet.The lowest impact items on the menu are vegetarian, and include a black bean burger (0.86kg) and apple and walnut salad with baked polenta (0.97kg). Those with meat range between 2.72kg CO2e to 5.4kg CO2e.Sticklebarn\u0027s food and beverages manager Gareth Fuke said: Food is such an important part of people\u0027s lives and there is much more awareness and interest in seasonal and local.The carbon calculator is a way of quantifying this. It helps us plan the menu and provides diners with choices.It\u0027s been well received and people appreciate being given the freedom to choose what they want to eat.We want meat on our menu that is local and high quality so we can cater for everyone.At Sticklebarn we champion the traditional Herdwick breed for our lamb dishes, produced by local farmers including our tenant farmers.These hardy sheep graze on our mountains and taste wonderful.Prince Harry announces surprise trip to the Netherlands next week - with Baby Sussex due any daySchools criticised for locking toilets during class time to stop children skipping lessonsFemale bodies found in a freezer in east London may not be identified for a week as police given more time to question suspectComment: Venezuela exposes just how far the Left will go to deny the true horrors of socialismBritish documents reignite rumours of rift between Japan\u0026#39s new emperor and his brotherLocal elections 2019: What time do the polls open tomorrow and when will we know the results?Brexit latest news: Labour  indicates deal on a customs union is closePensioners playing video games more than ever thanks to smartphonesMueller accuses Barr of creating \u0026#39public confusion\u0026#39 with inaccurate summary of his Trump reportComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s latest anti-Semitism scandal will change nothing, because to Labour members it\u0026#39s all a conspiracyJulian Assange jailed for 50 weeks for going into hiding as judge reveals his asylum cost UK taxpayer £16mComment: Maduro is fast running out of friends.

If that\u0027s what\u0027s required, that\u0027s what the United States will do, Mr Pompeo said in an interview with Fox Business Network, but added that the United States would prefer a peaceful transition of power in Venezuela.Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido earlier called for a massive May Day protest to increase the pressure on President Nicolas Maduro after a day of violent clashes on the streets of the capital.Mr Guaido said Wednesday\u0027s rally would be the biggest in the history of Venezuela as he presses his attempt to unseat the president.Members of the Bolivarian National Guard who joined Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed acting president Juan Guaido fire into the air to repel forces loyal to President Nicolas MaduroAcross all of Venezuela, we will be in the streets, said the National Assembly leader, recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries, as he repeated his call for the armed forces to join Operation Freedom to overthrow the socialist leader.Mr Maduro however remained defiant after Mr Guaido\u0027s call on Tuesday for the military to rise up appeared to have largely failed.Following a day of clashes between demonstrators and police on the streets of Caracas,  Mr Maduro on Tuesday evening said he had defeated an attempted coup.Mr Maduro, who is also due to lead a May Day rally in Caracas, declared victory over the uprising - congratulating the armed forces for having defeated this small group that intended to spread violence through putschist skirmishes.This will not go unpunished, Mr Maduro said in an address broadcast on television and radio.Maduro appears flanked by Venezuela\u0026#39s Defence Minister and two top military commanders in a photo released on Tuesday by the Miraflores Press Office(Prosecutors) will launch criminal prosecutions for the serious crimes that have been committed against the constitution, the rule of law and the right to peace.Tensions in Venezuela have been ratcheted up to a critical level this year, after Mr Guaido announced on January 23 that he was the acting president under the constitution. He said Mr Maduro had been fraudulently re-elected last year.Mr Guaido had rallied his supporters with a video message early on Tuesday that showed him - for the first time - with armed troops who he said had heeded months of urging to join his campaign to oust Mr Maduro.He claimed the move was the beginning of the end of Mr Maduro\u0027s regime, and there was no turning back.We showed there are soldiers willing to defend the constitution, and there are many more, Mr Guaido said in the video message.The 35-year-old opposition leader was filmed outside the La Carlota air base, where he asked the armed forces inside to join him.An opposition demonstrator walks near a bus in flames during clashes with soldiers loyal to MaduroMr Guaido had been immediately backed by the United States, where President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday that Washington was standing behind the Venezuelan people and their freedom.Thousands of opposition supporters flocked onto a highway near the air base, many waving Venezuelan flags, but they were met with gunfire and tear-gas fired by soldiers at the compound\u0027s perimeter.Soldiers backing Mr Guaido wore blue armbands to demonstrate their allegiance to the opposition leader but there appeared to be few of them.Riots also erupted in several other cities across the country, with dozens injured and one death reported, according to human rights groups.Brazil said a number of Venezuelan troops had sought asylum at its Caracas embassy. Brazilian media put that number at 25.But Mr Maduro had called on his forces to show nerves of steel and troops in riot gear, backed by armored vehicles and water tankers, lined up against the demonstrators.Hours after the revolt by military officers appeared to be fizzling out, Mr Pompeo told CNN he believed Maduro was ready to flee to ally Cuba before he was dissuaded by Russia - a claim Mr Maduro later refuted as a joke.Russia\u0027s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday calling the assertion part of an information war.Moscow has previously accused the United States of trying to foment a coup in Venezuela, a close Russian ally, and of trying to demoralise the army by spreading potentially morale-sapping fake news.Please review our commenting policyPrince Harry announces surprise trip to the Netherlands next week - with Baby Sussex due any daySchools criticised for locking toilets during class time to stop children skipping lessonsFemale bodies found in a freezer in east London may not be identified for a week as police given more time to question suspectComment: Venezuela exposes just how far the Left will go to deny the true horrors of socialismBritish documents reignite rumours of rift between Japan\u0026#39s new emperor and his brotherLocal elections 2019: What time do the polls open tomorrow and when will we know the results?Brexit latest news: Labour  indicates deal on a customs union is closePensioners playing video games more than ever thanks to smartphonesMueller accuses Barr of creating \u0026#39public confusion\u0026#39 with inaccurate summary of his Trump reportComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s latest anti-Semitism scandal will change nothing, because to Labour members it\u0026#39s all a conspiracyJulian Assange jailed for 50 weeks for going into hiding as judge reveals his asylum cost UK taxpayer £16mComment: Maduro is fast running out of friends.

Growth of output and new orders slowed, leading to job cuts for the third time in the past four months.“The trend in new export business was especially weak, as high stock holdings at clients and slower global economic growth led to reduced demand from key markets such as the European Union, the USA and China.”Brexit stockpiling continued to support production output as Britain\u0027s exit day remains uncertain, with a new deadline of October 31 to come up with a deal.Manufacturing employment declined for the third time in the past four months during April, with job losses attributed to “natural wastage, improved efficiency and workforce restructuring”.“Companies plan to use new product launches, new technologies and improved marketing strategies to drive growth forward in the coming months.“However, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on plans, as some firms remain concerned about future growth prospects and the likely impact on output and demand from the unwinding of inventory positions later in the year,” Mr Dobson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just that a fluffy bunny is not the sort of thing that can be relied upon to keep the wolves from the door for long.\u0026nbspThe numbers Coupe unveiled contained much of what the City, which doesn’t tend to look much further than the end of its own nose, tends to coo over.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s boss favoured profit over logic in the Asda mergerCMA slays Sainsbury\u0027s, Asda attempt to create supermarket Thanos Sainsbury\u0027s £12bn merger with Asda blocked by regulatorUnderlying profits - which strip out all sorts of nasties such as the £48m blown on the failed Asda experiment - were up 7.8 per cent at £692m and so (crucially) was the idend. Debt was down, ditto underlying costs.\u0026nbspIt was better than analysts had expected and lit a fire under the shares, which were the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 early on.\u0026nbspBut all those apparently fresh looking numbers need a little context. Let’s start with the shares. They’ve been bouncing around at near 30 year lows. Set against that, a 4 per cent boost to the price is like scoring a consolation goal in injury time to ease the pain of being down by five.\u0026nbspThen there’s the “underlying” number Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspso keen for people to focus their attention on.

Kantar’s authoritative retail survey has shown the group consistently losing market share. Sainsbury’s complains that it doesn’t include Argos and general merchandise in its numbers but the same is true for, say, Tesco, which has been doing a lot better when it comes to what Kantar does include.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder when it comes to corporate results and the City decided it fancied these ones despite the issues I’ve raised.

Growth of output and new orders slowed, leading to job cuts for the third time in the past four months.“The trend in new export business was especially weak, as high stock holdings at clients and slower global economic growth led to reduced demand from key markets such as the European Union, the USA and China.”Brexit stockpiling continued to support production output as Britain\u0027s exit day remains uncertain, with a new deadline of October 31 to come up with a deal.Manufacturing employment declined for the third time in the past four months during April, with job losses attributed to “natural wastage, improved efficiency and workforce restructuring”.“Companies plan to use new product launches, new technologies and improved marketing strategies to drive growth forward in the coming months.“However, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on plans, as some firms remain concerned about future growth prospects and the likely impact on output and demand from the unwinding of inventory positions later in the year,” Mr Dobson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk. And while some of the results in the quality of service report are disappointing, we are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others stressed security, such as new encryption tools which will stop messages from being snooped on.But others just added other new fe\u0026nbspatures – including one that allows Facebook to tell people who is crushing on them.The app taking the lead in Facebook\u0027s new privacy-focused approach, Messenger has been made end-to-end encrypted by default for the first time, fully securing messages sent on the service.The app itself has also been completely rebuilt from the ground up, Facebook says, as part of a project called LightSpeed that will make the app smaller and quicker to download, as well as faster to load.A standalone desktop app for both Windows and Mac users is also being introduced, as is a new space in the Messenger app called Close Friends, where users can share messages and Stories with selected close friends and family.The world\u0027s largest social media platform is getting a redesign - with the trademark blue panels of the site being turned white.The company says the redesign, which will roll out later this year, will make the website simpler, faster, more immersive and puts your communities at the centre.The firm\u0027s Facebook Dating feature has also been updated to include a new Secret Crush feature, which will allow users to select up to nine people they\u0027re already friends with they can express interest in. If that person has opted into Facebook Dating they will receive a notification telling them someone has a crush on them. If they add the original user\u0027s name to their own list it will inform both parties of a match, otherwise, the interest will remain secret.The social network confirmed its first physical product - the Portal video calling device - is to start shipping internationally this year.The photo-sharing platform has confirmed it is testing a feature that hides the total number of likes on photos and videos to try and focus attention on posts rather than the likes they get. The feature will be initially tested in Canada.Shopping is also becoming more integrated into the app, with users able to start tapping on items they like in a post and buying it on the spot.The Camera mode is also being updated, with a Create feature that will enable users to add more creative stickers and effects to their posts.The business version of the messaging app is introducing catalogues, which will enable users speaking to firms via the app to browse product catalogues without leaving the platform.Facebook said the service was aimed at small businesses who may not have a website.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it could eventually roll out to all users, leaving them unable to see how many likes their posts get.People will still be able to see when someone likes their posts, and clicking through will show everyone who has done so. But the only way to find out how many of them there are would be manually counting up, since Instagram will no longer show the big number next to the post.“Later this week, we’re running a test in Canada that removes the total number of likes on photos and video views in Feed, Permalink pages and Profile,” an Instagram spokesperson told\u0026nbspTechCrunch, which first reported the news. “We are testing this because we want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  Many influencers and other people who are paid to post on Facebook use the like metric as an important way of understanding how popular and engaging a post is. Those numbers can then affect how much brands will pay them to post, making likes an important number for those users.Facebook quietly announces exposure of millions of Instagram passwordsInstagram said it was aware that hiding the likes could therefore be financially difficult for many Instagram users. It told Techcrunch it was thinking through ways for them to communicate value to their brand partners and that the idea was still in its exploratory stages.As anxiety about the damage social media is doing to people\u0027s mental health and wellbeing has spread, the idea of removing some of the more obvious and competitive markers of a person\u0027s popularity has spread. The idea has gathered support from people including Kanye West, who last year sent a flurry of posts about the damage that like counters were doing to social media users.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Fans are hopeful the\u0026nbspidentity of the enigmatic H will be revealed following a devastating episode that saw Superintendent Ted Hastings end up behind bars.The latest outing saw the addition of Anna Maxwell Martin who plays Patricia Carmichael. Speaking on Zoe Ball’s Radio 2 show, the Bleak House actor revealed it was a struggle to learn her lines for the dialogue-heavy interrogation scenes.Created with Sketch.The best TV cliffhangers of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black.

While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series.

Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.“It is quite hard,” she said. “I became hysterical throughout the whole process giggling the whole time, internally freaking out the whole time.\u0026nbspI don’t remember much, oh gosh.\u0026nbspI learned one hundred million lines so I blanked it out like a trauma.”Line of Duty concludes this Sunday at 9pm on BBC1Line of DutyThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk. And while some of the results in the quality of service report are disappointing, we are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In this instance we decided that the role that the company plays in the area is very important.”Farquharson later told the media: “I think that’s probably enough on sponsors.”Last year’s\u0026nbspTurner\u0026nbspPrize was won by artist Charlotte Prodger with her film, shot on an iPhone, about “queer identity” and her experience of coming out as gay in rural Scotland.The controversy comes as a spotlight is thrown on the issue of sponsorship in the arts.In March, a £1 million donation from The Sackler Trust to the National Portrait Gallery was cancelled, amid the opioid drug crisis in the US.The full shortlist for the Turner Prize 2018The Turner Prize’s 10 most memorable and outrageous winnersFollowing the press conference, Stagecoach issued a statement, saying it “does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind based on disability, gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, religion, belief, age, nationality, race or ethnic origin.“Our Stagecoach culture values transparency, ersity, and respect,” it said. “We expect our employees to commit to doing the right thing, to respect other iniduals at all times and treat them with dignity, and thoughtfulness, and we are committed to providing equal opportunities for all.”Turner\u0026nbspContemporary said it had “spearheaded the social and economic regeneration of Margate”, and added: “The gallery seeks to challenge assumptions, break down barriers and showcase artistic excellence.”Tate said that taking the\u0026nbspTurner\u0026nbspPrize to a new location every other year “wouldn’t be possible without the host venue raising local support, and the value local businesses bring to these venues is enormously important, both to the exhibition they stage and the education and community projects it inspires”.This year’s shortlist includes Lawrence Abu Hamdan,\u0026nbspwho conducted interviews with former detainees of a notorious Syrian jail for an installation leading the way.The other three nominees include London-based filmmaker Helen Cammock, Columbian-born sculptor Oscar Murillo,\u0026nbspand self-taught artist Tai Shani, who explores “feminine subjectivity and experience through a gothicscience-fiction lens”.The four shortlisted artists’ work will be displayed from 28 September 2019 to 12 January 2020 at\u0026nbspTurner Contemporary in Margate.

Operators say that\u0026nbspas a result, they need to make up that shortfall by charging customers instead.They say they also need to increase fees as consumers increasingly switch to contactless payments, meaning fewer people are using cash machines.But Link said there was no danger of free cashpoints disappearing.John Howells, the chief executive, said: “Free access to cash is vital for consumers and the UK enjoys extensive coverage that Link is committed to protecting.“There are more than 50,000 free-to-use ATMs across the UK, 10,000 more than we had in 2009, and currently 12,700 pay-to-use cash machines, down from over 23,000 in 2009.“Less than 3 per cent of withdrawals at Link ATMs incur a fee.”A spokeswoman for Cardtronics said: “The decision on whether to introduce a fee is taken on a case-by-case basis and reflects the economic viability of the inidual machine. We only ever charge a fee when there is no other option apart from removing the machine altogether.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He asks what is more important, the UK\u0027s intelligence relationship with the US or the commercial relationship with China.May says the UK has a close relationship with the US and that will continue.\u0026nbspLewis presses her about \u0027systematic cyber espionage\u0027 from China. May says the UK is willing to call out those who challenge the UK in this way.She says Huawei is a private company that is owned by its workers in response to questions over its links to the Chinese state.Sarah Wollaston, chair of the liaison committee, asks if the government will check if the deal it gets is what the people want.May says her view has not changed on a second referendum. The British people had an instinct on what they voted for.Wollaston, a former Tory MP who resigned to join Change UK, says the public are unhappy, which is why the MPs kept voting against it.She asks if May would prefer a confirmatory referendum attached to her deal or a compromise with Labour.May says she does not accept that these are the only two options.Asked if she will extend the transition phase, May says it is\u0026nbspstill \u0027possible\u0027 to negotiate the final trade deal by the end of 2020.That is interesting...Wollaston, who is health committee chair, also presses May on multiple delays to the social care green paper.May says she will do that at the \u0027earliest opportunity\u0027. Wollaston says that is not good enough.David TC Davies, the chair of the Welsh Affairs committee, asks if Wales is ready for a no-deal Brexit.May says no-deal preparations continue to take place and the devolved administrations continue to be involved.Davies asks if she would prefer a no-deal or a no Brexit if her deal does not pass.Mays says she wants to leave the EU and that\u0027s her job. Pressed on whether she would support a no-deal, she says the best option is to leave with a deal.She says she was not able to leave on March 29 as MPs kept rejecting her deal.SNP\u0027s Angus Brendan MacNeill says he compared her to Gloria Gaynor at the last committee, because of her ability to survive.The international trade chair asks if she has changed her position on a second referendum, which she mentioned earlier,May says there has been no change to her position. She only mentioned it because MPs are campaigning for it.Labour\u0027s Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business committee, goes next.She asks about reports that EU students could pay higher fees than UK students after Brexit.May says no decision has been made on this issue.\u0026nbspReeves presses her on whether higher fees\u0026nbspwould discourage students, but May says it has not dissuaded foreign students from coming before.\u0026nbspThe UK has excellent universities, May says. The PM says the quality of education is what is important.Lastly, Reeves asks if she would welcome a female governor of the Bank of England. May jokes that she certainly welcomes women in senior positions.\u0026nbspMorgan asks about the spending review, which is due at the end of the summer. The three-year spending review could be scaled back, perhaps to a one-year review if the Brexit deal is not passed, May suggests.Northern Ireland committee chair Andrew Murrison is next. He says she was concerned about a no-deal as\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland was not\u0026nbspready for Brexit. What has been done?\u0026nbspMay says the government is working to revive talks to restore\u0026nbspthe Northern Ireland Assembly.\u0026nbspCooper says they are \u0027going round in circles\u0027. She asks May if she is ruling out changing\u0026nbspthe government\u0027s position on customs.\u0026nbspMay says the government has similar aims to Labour. But how that is achieved has not been wholly identified.May\u0027s long-standing rival Yvette Cooper is up next. She was May\u0027s shadow when the PM was home secretary.The home affairs committee chair asks May if she still plans to be part common external tariff for goods.May says it is important to be able to vary tariffs to have independent trade agreements.Cooper presses May on whether she is returning to the Chequers plan to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. \u0027Has nothing changed? Are we still stuck?\u0027\u0026nbspshe asks.May says it is a key part of talks with Labour and there is \u0027greater communality\u0027 than expected.Sir Patrick McLoughlin,\u0026nbspTory chair of the European statutory instruments committee, asks if\u0026nbspPM would\u0026nbsprule out leaving without a deal.May says parliament will not allow the UK to leave without a deal, but the EU is also involved in the decision.Stephen McPartland, Conservative chair of the slightly obscure\u0026nbspregulatory reform committee, grills the PM on regulations.May says the government is making sure that workers rights can be guaranteed.Veteran Brexiteer Bill Cash goes next. The European Scrutiny Committee asks May why she won\u0027t get on with leaving the EU.May says she has been trying to get on with it but MPs keep refusing to support her deal. The UK could be out already, she says.Cash tells her she should have resigned three weeks ago. He says parliament is being castrated because EU laws will be passed behind closed doors during the transition period.May disagrees, saying it is a necessary time to prepare for the future relationship.\u0027Don\u0027t agree,\u0027 says Cash, to laughs from MPs.May tells Jenkin that she will publish the withdrawal agreement implementation bill when it is ready. Work is going on behind the scenes.Theresa May is\u0026nbspappearing before the Liaison Committee, which is made up of senior MPs who chair the other Commons committees.First up she runs through the current situation with Brexit. She says there have been \u0027constructive\u0027 and \u0027meaningful\u0027 talks with Labour.She confirms if cross-party talks fail then the UK can leave without a deal, revoke article 50, hold a referendum or leave with a deal.In response, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, says he wants to use the debate today to outline the government\u0027s intention to make its climate charge targets more ambitious. We must do more, he admits.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe first person person to make it clear that climate change was\u0026nbspan emergency\u0026nbspin the Commons was Margaret Thatcher, he claims.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is now opening the climate change debate - his party has tabled a motion today which will ask MPs to vote on whether to declare a climate emergency later this evening.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says we are witnessing an unprecedented surge of climate activism, and says we hear you.\u0026nbspSpeaking in the Commons, he\u0026nbspsaid: This House must declare an environment and climate emergency. We have no time to waste.We are living in a climate crisis that will spiral dangerously out of control unless we take rapid and dramatic action now.This is no longer about a distant future. We are talking about nothing less than the irreversible destruction of the environment within our lifetimes.\u0026nbspReferring to the cancellation of the ferries contract, a Department for Transport spokesperson said the termination would cost the public purse less than keeping the contracts.The spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: The government\u0027s freight capacity contracts were a vital part of contingency measures, ensuring goods like medicines could enter the UK in the case of disruption during a no-deal Brexit.Following the extension, the government is reviewing all preparedness plans. The government\u0027s freight capacity contracts for the summer period are no longer needed and have therefore been terminated.The government has taken this decision now as it represents the best value for money for taxpayers.The termination of these contracts has resulted in less cost to the taxpayer than the termination costs reported by the NAO in their own analysis of the freight capacity contracts.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You rock Gaia and Matilde.”The hashtag #GaiaeMatilde – the names of the two young women in the photo – has gained traction on Twitter.Gaia can be seen appearing to attempt to take another photo kissing her friend after taking the first one but a security agent appears to swiftly place their hand in the way in order to separate the two young women.“The hand of another friend that ides,” says the caption of an image which can be seen on her Instagram Stories.Mr Salvini has been mocked in the wake of the image – with an influx of memes\u0026nbsppoking fun at the expression on his face. Others have hailed the women’s “brave” and “glorious” protest.“When the minister urged those present to take the stage and take a selfie with him, we had this idea because he participated in World Congress of Families as a minister,” Gaia, who has only been identified by her first name, told Euronews.\u0026nbsp“We made a provocative instinctive gesture, not at all premeditated. On stage, Salvini did not expect us to take a picture like this. When we kissed, an agent I think, separated us sharply and Salvini then told us ‘I wish you luck’ so we took off thanking him ironically.”Campaigners argue women’s rights are being rolled back\u0026nbspunder Mr Salvini and\u0026nbsptraditional stereotypes about the role of women are also worsening.The political leader was fiercely criticised after neither he nor any Minister from the League chose to attend national celebrations which sees Italy mark\u0026nbspthe liberation from fascism on 25 April each year.Campaigners protest against \u0027medieval\u0027 anti-abortion summit in ItalyLast week, Italian media documented neo-fascist demonstrations, desecrations of memorials of participants of the Italian resistance against fascism, and drawings of swastikas across the country. Some 30 people held a banner reading “Honour to Benito Mussolini” while performing fascist salutes in Milan.A day later, a garland commemorating a partisan who fought fascism in WW2 was burned down in Milan. Other memorials were desecrated across the country.The League, which supports far right and anti-immigration policies, formed a government coalition with the Five Star Movement in June 2018, after it won about 17 per cent of the vote in a general election. It now has some 35 per cent according to recent polls.\u0026nbspworld congress of familiesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Spanish parliament contains a constellation of smaller regionalist parties, including some who advocate independence for their regions from Spain. It was however Mr Sanchez’s inability to reach an accommodation with these forces earlier in the year that originally led to him calling a snap election.The largest regionalist party, the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), which advocates Catalan independence, said earlier this week that it would not write Mr Sanchez a “blank cheque” to govern, but that it was willing to cooperate.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A military member throws a tear gas canister near the Generalisimo Francisco de Miranda Airbase La Carlota, in Caracas, Venezuela.

Idealistic young voters are all ears.There is a solution to our looming energy crisis — cheap, clean shale gas. But feeble Energy Secretary Greg Clark threw it away, forcing fracking tsar Natascha Engel to quit yesterday in disgust.After nine dithering years in power, with no idea how to keep the lights on, this Government is damned now whichever way it jumps.Protesters claiming “The End Is Nigh” are swarming like angry wasps.Their claims may be simplistic and sometimes , but they have been nailed on Netflix by national treasure Sir David Attenborough and hammered home by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg.Jezza is using these crowd-pullers to turn dull carbon emissions into a glittering crusade — a national emergency no less.His Momentum Marxists are tutoring the Extinction Rebellion protesters who gridlocked London and turned -year-old Greta into a global warming superstar. The Tories have nothing to say.Gutless Clark abandoned fracking contractors who risked hundreds of million only to see Project Shale strangled at birth.Engel’s walk-out should surprise nobody. I received a frantic call from the ex-Labour MP weeks ago warning about “nonsense” rules which stop fracking at the slightest tremor.She told me: “This is a real threat to the industry and means buying more Russian gas.” Her argument doesn’t wash with Jezza’s anti-capitalist anarchists, Greta or Blue Planet’s Sir David, who between them now run UK energy policy.Arguments for shale have been drowned out by images of raging bushfires, tidal waves and an Apocalypse Now soundtrack.Saint David’s bell tolls, and it tolls for the Tories.Climate change is the issue of the day. They have thrown in the towel on this as on so much .Greta Thunberg is Sweden’s new dancing queen, upstaging gas-guzzling hypocrite Emma Thompson and treating Britain’s top ministers with withering sarcasm.They were doing NOTHING to reduce carbon emissions, she spat. In truth, Britain is leading Europe, at huge cost, in reducing carbon emissions while replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Wind and solar energy are replacing coal.It is also a fact, courtesy of the respected Intergovern- mental Panel On Climate Change, that global warming is not about to roast us all alive or drown us beneath stormy oceans.Polar bears are multiplying, not disappearing. Walruses are thriving, not throwing themselves off rocks.None of this washes with single-issue, black-and-white zealots who regard all inconvenient truth as the work of the Devil. I am no climate change denier. We are polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.If I ruled the world, Russia, China, India and America would not turn oceans and rivers into chemical sewers.I would ban plastic dumping, save sea le from being choked or poisoned and halt deforestation and desert- ication. But I don’t rule the world, and nor does Saint David or Greta Thunberg — or the hundreds of, let’s say, well-intentioned young folk who think paralysing London is the next best thing.Britain deserves credit for cutting carbon emissions further and faster than most EU countries.Temperatures are rising, but not by Extinction Rebellion or Miss Thunberg’s worst-case projections.Evangelical followers want an end to air travel except when they go skiing.Everything must come by sea even though shipping is a highly polluting form of transport.We must grow our own food, putting farmers in poor countries out of a job and workers here on the dole.WARREN BUFFETT, the legendary Sage of Omaha, has amassed billions putting his money where his mouth is.He thinks Britain, with its rule of law and decent, hard-working citizens is the world’s best place to invest, regardless of Brexit.He’s not alone. Once Brexit is settled, a wall of money will be unleashed by firms at home and abroad who have been sitting on the fence for three years.There is only one fly in the ointment – the prospect of anti-Semitic, US-hating, terrorist-backing Jeremy Corbyn as our next PM.Jezza’s much brighter brother Piers deserves a final say on this sudden burst of mass hysteria and Greta worship.“Listening to an ignorant, brainwashed child is deranged,” he tweets. “I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could also hand Britain an economic boom, and reduce our dependence on energy imports from far-flung dictatorships.Cowardly Business Secretary Greg Clark is squandering this windfall by giving in to the green lobby. As Engel says — listen to the science, not just to those who shout the loudest.At least the Tories aren’t quite as bad as Jeremy Corbyn, who would ban fracking altogether and destroy hundreds of jobs in the process.It is time the Government ignored leftie posturing and turned on the shale gas taps.THE five thugs suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence have repeatedly dodged justice. So it’s an outrage they’ve been allowed to run up nearly £million in legal aid — funded, of course, by the taxpayer.Gary Dobson and David Norris lied for  years before finally being convicted of murder, while the other three have always refused to explain their role in the racist attack on Stephen.Of course every suspect has the right to a defence, but it can’t be fair that such sums have been lavished on lawyers for these fundamentally dishonest men.Contrast this state-funded generosity with the treatment of Stephen’s grieving parents, who were denied legal aid when trying to get justice for their son.Coming hot on the heels of Shamima Begum’s legal aid windfall, this is fresh proof the system isn’t working. Legal aid is meant to ensure the right to a fair trial, not help killers avoid being held to account.LEEDS United boss Marcelo Bielsa has restored faith in modern football.His players were wrong to score against Aston Villa while their opponents had a man down injured, but he immediately put it right by gting Villa an equaliser.You could see on Bielsa’s face how much it hurt. The gesture was the final nail in the coffin for Leeds’ automatic promotion challenge — and an incredible example for footie-mad kids who need to know the importance of fair play.In an era where sport stars hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, it’s heart-warming to see a team go about things the right way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

concluding that income between the rich and poor has barely shted during her three years as PM.The study said social mobility has stagnated at virtually all le stages and inequality will remain entrenched in Britain from birth to work without radical action from the Government.Even when people from a disadvantaged background land a professional job, they earn  per cent less than their privileged colleagues, the report said.Overall, those from working-class backgrounds earn a quarter less a year than those from middle-class backgrounds.The Social Mobility Commission called on ministers to provide additional funding for older teenagers in education and to extend free childcare to more low-income families, in an effort to break down barriers.The findings will come as a further setback to Mrs May, who entered Downing Street in  promising to tackle the burning injustice of social inequality.The report - the first since new commissioners were appointed last year following the mass resignation of their predecessors led by former Labour cabinet minister Alan Milburn - said the numbers from professional backgrounds who were in professional jobs had actually risen slightly, from  per cent in  to  per cent last year.In contrast, last year only  per cent of those from working-class backgrounds had professional jobs, slightly up from  per cent in .Even when those from working-class backgrounds succeeded in entering the professions, the report found that they earned on average  per cent less than their more privileged colleagues.For women, the position was even worse, with working class women in professional jobs paid  per cent less than men from more affluent backgrounds.Being born privileged means you are likely to remain privileged, said commission chairwoman Dame Martina Milburn.But being born disadvantaged means you may have to overcome a series of barriers to ensure you and your children are not stuck in the same trap.Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the BBC: Social mobility is a very dficult thing to move.And, actually, we have had social immobility issues in this country for decades, for generations.The report found that while there was twice the number of - to -year-olds in further education as there were in school sixth forms, the level of funding for the sector had fallen by % since -.While increasing numbers of students from disadvantaged backgrounds were entering university, they were more likely to drop out before graduating.The report called for a signicant increase in funding for all - to -year-olds in education, with a special student premium for the disadvantaged."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000425556701.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"local elections 2019 candidates when where","story":"We explain when and where they are, how to find out who your candidates are and how to checkyou’re registered to vote.Local elections are on Thursday, May , .There are  councils in England, but not every authority will be holding elections.Elections take place in four-year cycles so dferent councils will hold elections in dferent years.This year they are happening in  councils and , seats are up for grabs with about , people standing.As well as England, voters will go to the polls to elect  councillors to Northern Irelands  councils.The majority of England’s smaller councils are holding elections and about  of the larger ones are.There are also six mayoral elections in Bedford, Copeland, Leicester, Mansfield, Middlesbrough and North of Tyne.No elections are taking place in London or Scotland and Wales.Polling stations will open at am and close at pm.Details of where you need to go are on you polling card.If you aren’t sure where it is you can contact your local council to find out where you need to go.To check to seethere are local elections in your area you an pop in your post code here.With more about , people running in this week’s election it can be confusing to know who is standing in your area.You can go here, to find out about the candidates in your area just by popping in your post code.It will tell youthere are elections in your area and it will provide a list of the candidates and the party they represent.The deadline to register to vote has past, but you can find outyou’re registered here.The Conservatives are defending the largest number of seats, with , Tory councillors up for re-election, compared with , for Labour.The Liberal Democrats have  seats to defend, Ukip  and the Green Party .There are also  seats held by independents being fought.Brighton, Cheshire West, Chester, Milton Keynes, Bolton, Calderdale, Scarborough, Thurrock and Blackpool are all places to watch.The first results will come between midnight and am on Friday with St Helens, Sunderland, Swindon and North Tyneside predicted to be the quickest.Between  and am results will start coming in from Oldham, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Stockport, Liverpool and Trafford.Some local authorities won’t start counting until am.Manchester is expected to declare at pm, Brighton and York at pm and Cheshire West and Chester at pm."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000439018870.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"traveller mum kids family school","story":"The -year-old traveller - who hit headlines last year when she shared pictures of her children sleeping in a police station after she was made homeless - is living in emergency housing and has to take three separate buses to get her kids to school every day.Then she has to do the entire arduous journey again in the afternoon to pick them up.The single mum - who was forced to leave her rented flat two years ago after it was repossessed and has been living in emergency housing in Dublin ever since - appears in the next episode of The Gypsies Next Door, airing this Thursday at pm on Channel .“It takes almost two hours and three dferent buses in the morning and three dferent buses back, she says.People just say, just change school, but why should I put my children out of somewhere where they’re happy and they’re accepted there. You begin to think, why is this happening to me ”Margaret is now campaigning for better rights for homeless people after she became the subject of online abuse - with trolls accusing her of using her children in order to get a home when she posted viral pictures of them sleeping on plastic chairs last year.Margaret didn’t help her case when she had to appear in court in October  for shoplting over  Euros worth of clothes from Penneys in Dublin. She avoided jail but was put on probation for a year, telling the Irish Sun: “The clothes were for the kids. I feel like I am being targeted. It is letting the Government off the hook.”In the show, we see Margaret speaking at a protest in the Irish capital about the desperation of homelessness. At one point, she is filmed receiving a phone call from the council about news of a possible house but, just a few weeks later, her hopes are dashed as the offer of housing fails to materialise – the council is unable to guarantee accommodation for a family as big as hers.Her devastation is apparent, but she remains hopeful and speaks on the show about dreaming of living in a house where her children can go out and play with children in the road, and I can put on their pot of dinner and wash their clothes in a washing machine – stupid little things that mean nothing but mean everything when you haven’t got it.The programme moves on to traveller Tony, the ex-husband of glamour model Danielle Mason –who is opening a tanning salon with his millionaire pal and neighbour, Colin.But Tony’s dreams of having a successful business are postponed when he receives a -month prison sentence for offences of driving without a licence, dangerous driving and failure to stop for the police.His ex Danielle describes his unpredictable nature, saying: He craves the family le but then he never calms down, he’s out of control - that’s why I can’t be with him.Tony’s his own worst enemy. He really tries to pull it together and do the right things by everyone but then he’s always got that other side to him which is really wild.”The programme also covers the funeral of  year-old Mikey Connors  – a legend in the traveller community who was killed in a car accident while racing his horse-trap. Organised by his devastated -year-old brother Simey, we witness the biggest traveller funeral ever that includes a parade of  white Rolls-Royces, thousands of mourners and horse-trap races that cause chaos on the roads of Ashtead in Surrey.As Paul Brown, the chief undertaker, says: “The amount of money that has been spent is immense. It’s their funeral and they’re not bothered what they do, who they upset, that’s how it is.”But other residents aren’t so happy, with one saying: “Wonderthe police would close the road for my funeral.

Furious critics pointed out Labour activists had been suspended for retweeting conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds – and demanded an apology.Labour Against Anti-Semitism said the revelation proved Jeremy Corbyn “shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near Downing Street”.It said the foreword was as “damning and damaging” as his support in  for an “offensive” mural that featured anti-Semitic tropes.Ex-Labour MP Ian Austin said: “This is absolutely appalling.“Decent people will be sickened to see him describing as “brilliant” a book by someone who pushed deeply and clearly racist theories about Jewish people controlling banks, newspapers, governments and wars to further their financial interests.Labour insisted Jeremy had praised the “Liberal Hobson’s century-old classic study of imperialism in Africa and Asia”.But a spokesman claimed: “Jeremy completely rejects the anti-Semitic elements of his analysis.”The spokesman did not answer why the Labour leader- then a backbencher – had still decided to praise the work.JA Hobson made anti-Semitic comments in some of his other books.In a  book about the Boer War, hje blamed a “small group of international financiers, chiefly German in origin and Jewish in race” for the conflict.He said “the rich and powerful liquor trade… is entirely in the hands of Jews… the stock exchange is needless to say, mostly Jewish … the press of Johannesburg is chiefly their property.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a scammer.The conman first made contact with her via a Facebook fan page dedicated to Derbyshire-born Jason who moved to LA about  years ago.“I thought, ‘Oh, that’s nice of him, talking to his fans’. I might have been star-struck then, I don’t know,” says the anonymous victim. Once she was hooked in, the messages rapidly escalated to “Jason” telling her he loved her and that, surprise surprise, he was having some financial dficulties and needed help because a film payment had been delayed.He added, and I write this verbatim: “I really need you to do this for me honey I can’t trust anyone but you with my money honey.”At this point, did alarm bells ring that she was, in fact, ­conversing with the Hunny ­Monster  Nope, seems not.So, over a period of time, she sent “a substantial amount which would have made a dference to my le and my family”.I’m torn between sympathy and utter disbelief that someone could be so naive.Online fraud is now an epidemic and plenty have lost money in scams so sophisticated that even the most tech-savvy would struggle to spot them.It’s a world away from the ­early-day scams of someone in Nigeria claiming to have a ­fortune locked away in an account they can only accessyou can just send £squillion right now.But what of “Jason Statham” and his like or, worse, the ones who frequent dating sites in the hope of carrying out their sting in person Barely a week goes by when we don’t read a story of someone who thought they had met the partner of their dreams . . . only to discover, several thousand pounds and a whole lot of heartbreak later, that they weren’t who they claimed to be.It goes without saying that loss or loneliness can sometimes make us throw caution to the wind in our search for love.But common sense must always be preserved.FORMER principal ballet dancer Dame Gillian Lynne has left £.million in her will.A robust fortune garnered from her role as choreographer for smash-hit musicals such as Cats and Phantom Of The Opera.Gillian’s path to success is a salutary lesson for anyone currently despairing that their child is struggling at school.When Gillian was young, her mother was concerned about her lack of concentration, and therefore progress, in lessons.So she took her daughter to see a child behavioural specialist who, after a few routine questions, switched on the radio and told Gillian that he and her mother were going to step outside for a while.Once in the corridor, they peeped through the window and watched as Gillian started moving to the music.“There’s nothing wrong with your daughter,” he concluded. “She’s a dancer. Take her to dance school.”Sadly, around  years on, the State still fails to understand that creativity is as important as literacy in giving kids the best chance of a happy, successful adulthood.When you have a spare  minutes, watch Sir Ken Robinson’s TED talk asking: “Do schools kill creativity ”They can, and plenty do. And until the Government changes the education system, thousands of bored, disenfranchised kids will fail in it.WHILE sightseeing in Japan, Ed Sheeran bizarrely chose a full panda outfit in a bid to go incognito.But when he briefly removed it in a store, a fan clocked him and asked for a selfie .Still, nice to see that Ed recovered from the ordeal in time to run the London Marathon.What a showbiz trouper he is.BRITISH-born Michael Adebowale is the evil brute who killed and tried to decapitate soldier Lee Rigby in broad daylight.He is currently residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure in HMP Wakefield – aka “Monster Mansion” – where other lags see him as a top target, and he’s feeling an ickle bit scared, poor lamb.Consequently, he has asked for advice on how to move to a cushier jail in his parents’ home country of Nigeria.The answer, of course, should be a firm no.In the meantime, how refreshing to hear of a ­ruthless killer experiencing jail time that ­actually feels like a ­punishment for his heinous crime.WHEN it launched in , Instagram rapidly became the go-to place for those who wanted to “filter the s**t”out of their everyday lives.Suddenly, no one had any blemishes, they all resembled Elle Macpherson in a bikini and even their cofed and slightly startled dog looked like it had just stepped off the winner’s podium at Crufts.It became known as “Instasham” and, along with other social media sites, took a hefty share of blame for the worrying increase in poor self-esteem among young girls who felt they couldn’t match up to the images of perfection being posted by their idols.Now, riding the waves of a welcome sea change in attitude, media-savvy social media “influencers” are falling over themselves to show how imperfect they are.“Just woken up” selfies with no make-up are a favourite, along with close-ups of spots, stretch marks, cellulite, and tummy rolls . . . all with earnest captions reminding us that we’re not all ­perfect.Undoubtedly, it is a well-meaning step towards helping their young fans realise that whatever face or body you’re born with, it’s better to work at loving who you are and not what you look like.But surely, true progress is when a visible blemish tummy roll stretch mark is deemed so normal that it doesn’t even warrant comment Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its author is not your standard liberal conscience, ­cloistered in Whitehall or a university sociology department.  Baroness Helen Newlove knows only too well what it is like to be a victim of crime.Twelve years ago she was an ordinary mum living in a suburb of Warrington, Cheshire, when her husband left their home to confront a group of drunken youths who were vandalising his car. He never ed.He was kicked and beaten so savagely that he later died in hospital.What was especially galling for his we and three daughters was that the three youths responsible —  who were each jailed for le — had been the ­subject of numerous complaints.One of those jailed for Garry’s murder had already been on an assault charge but had been released on bail just a few hours earlier to resume his le ­terrorising local residents.Neither police, prosecutors nor the courts seemed to appreciate just how far out of control the youths had become.They failed to put together numerous complaints of antisocial behaviour to see the overall picture. As a result, the problem was allowed to escalate to its murderous conclusion.Sadly, to judge by Baroness Newlove’s report, too little has changed in the years since her first husband’s ­murder. Still, she says, police are treating complaints about anti- social behaviour as isolated incidents, each dismissed as “low-level crime”.A vandalised car is treated as a problem to be sorted out with an insurance claim.  Youths riding motorbikes round a children’s playground might be challenged by police on one ­occasion but it is never followed up.  Dope-smoking seems effectively to have been legalised, the police ­having all but given up even speaking to those involved. At the same time, incidents of antisocial behaviour are  rising sharply.Last year,  per cent of people responding to the British Crime Survey — an annual poll of more than , randomly-selected Britons — reported witnessing antisocial behaviour, up from . per cent the year before.This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.In  the Government introduced what it called a “community trigger” — which was supposed to give residents the right to demand greater actionthree or more separate reports on antisocial behaviour were received within a six-month period.Residents can demand a “case review”, at which the authorities must explain what action they intend to take.Yet in half of local authority areas, says Newlove, the community trigger process was not used during  .Newlove also has a gripe with the police  service — the non-emergency number introduced in .  It was ­supposed to encourage us to report non-le-threatening incidents for which we might be reluctant to call .But, as I found from my own experience, it seems to be used as a means of fobbing us off.When I came across someone stealing from a pile of wood by the roadside I rang the number —  but it took ages to have the call answered and even when it was, nothing  happened, even though I had taken down the registration plate of the thieves’  vehicle.To cap the insult, while  calls are free it costs p to call .Of course, police can’t be expected to deal with and solve every single crime. I know that officer numbers have fallen and that in some areas they are struggling with an epidemic of kne murders, which obviously needs to take priority.Butyou give people the impression that you are no longer even bothering to try to police “low-level” crime, you are just inviting the problem to escalate.It isn’t just the police, however, who are responsible for the lack of action on antisocial behaviour. Local authorities have filled their town centres with enforcement officers, who merrily hand out £ fines for the smallest misdemeanours, such as dropping fag ends.Yet the private firms trusted with ­dealing with litter louts — and who are disgracefully often employed on contracts which incentivise them to hand out as many fines as  possible — are not  interested in policing housing estates.They are only interested in what they find profitable — dishing out fines to soft targets in shopping centres.Serious antisocial behaviour of the sort which preceded Garry Newlove’s murder falls between two stools — it is considered too much bother for enforcement officers but not serious enough for police investigation.But as Baroness Newlove knows only too well, turning a blind eye to repeated antisocial behaviour makes the lives of residents a misery and can end up ­having fatal consequences.The Government has been quick to respond to proposals from the usual bleeding-heart liberals who seem to run the criminal justice system — recently agreeing, for example, to look into ­abolishing prison sentences of less than six months.Ministers must take note of what the outgoing Victims’ Commissioner is saying on the lax approach to antisocial ­behaviour and put the interests of the victims, not criminals, first. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Senior figures from the Tories and Labour will resume negotiations on Tuesday, after the Bank Holiday weekend, after early signs of compromise this week. Tory Brexiteers now fear Theresa May will climb down and accept some form of Labouraposs customs union plan - after the Cabinet was warned options are limited. One minister, Jeremy Wright, told yesterdayaposs Cabinet meeting the choices were like being in an acid bath while Michael Gove said an unpalatable” deal was better than a disastrous one. And Chief Whip Julian Smith reportedly warned: Itaposs a customs union or a second referendum, and we are not having a second referendum. Yet despite the warnings, both sides remained downbeat about the chances of striking a deal in time to scrap planned European elections on May .    Labouraposs Shadow Business Secretary said today she hopes there will be compromise - but the Tories still had to move. Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC: The talks so far have been positive, both sides have gone in with the intention to try and reach a compromise. Weaposre waiting to seethe government moves on some of its positions. She did, however, say the Government may have no option but to move towards Labour on a customs union. I think, pragmatically, that they potentially may have no option in order to be able to push this deal through, she said. We are fleshing out the details to see how far the Government can move towards us and then we will be able to ascertain how far we are able to move towards them. There are certain issues that we think they will be prepared to move on and we might be prepared to support certain positions. There are certain areas which we havenapost seen any movement at all. We want to take a view on the whole package, the whole deal, to seethere has been any true movement. Quizzed by journalists today, No refused to rule out the PM caving in and accepting a customs union as the price of a deal with Labour. A senior Downing Street source said: “We believe that leaving the EU with a negotiated deal is the right thing to do and in order to do that we will clearly need compromise on both sides in the talks.” Talks were being carried out “seriously and in good spirits”, they added. “Both sides will need to show movement.” Fuelling hopes a breakthrough, Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said: “We believe a sensible compromise is available and can win the support of Parliament.” Talks between officials took place yesterday, and negotiations will continue next week between ministers and their Labour counterparts. “There is signicant movement being discussed,” the Labour leader’s spokesman added. “We have seen clear evidence that the Government is prepared to explore shts in its position, and that’s what we need to nail down - how far and where those shts are going to go.” Asked Labour was still wedded to a UK-EU trading arrangement defined as “a customs union”, he said: “The name isn’t the most important thing.” By next week, five weeks will have passed since Brexit was due to take place. And both main parties will have seen the results of tomorrow’s local elections in England, which are set to be overshadowed by the ongoing EU withdrawal crisis. If the talks break down, ministers are planning to give MPs another series of votes on Brexit options, though this time using a preferential system so that they are forced to agree on at least option.    Government insiders hope this would pit Mrs May’s own proposal into a run-off with the next favourite option - probably a softer Brexit - and focus the minds of Tory Brexiteer rebels to finally back her deal. Tory ministers are split over whether to move to Labouraposs position on Brexit - which includes a customs union with the EU, the most controversial area for compromise. Brexiteers led a failed bid to rush the Withdrawal Agreement Bill back to Parliament, pushing MPs into another Brexit vote within days. And Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the Government risks losing Tory supportit agrees a customs union. “If we were proposing, which I very much hope we don’t, to sign up to the customs union, then I think there is a risk that you would lose more Conservative MPs than you would gain Labour MPs,” he said. But Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told the Cabinet the options are like being in an acid bath... because there are no good options, the Times reports.  Chief Whip Julian Smith told members of Cabinet it was “time to get real” over the options, after Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal was defeated three times, thereports. And Environment Secretary Michael Gove argued for promising the benefits of a customs union, it is reported. Brexit was delayed last month until October , with EU chief Donald Tusk warning: Please do not waste this time. But the House of Commons finished for the day just after pm yesterday as MPs failed to find progress on Brexit.

The Prime Minister has been nicknamed the “Maybot” amid claims she dodges questions and instead repeats responses from a set, pre-programmed menu.  Now, researchers have evidence she is less open than other Conservative PMs.  University of York academics have been studying the way she deals with TV and radio interviews, comparing her performance with answers offered by David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.  They found that during two interviews after she became PM in  and four during the  general election campaign, Mrs May answered just % of questions put to her.  In contrast, Mr Cameron answered % of questions in the  general election run-in, while both Mr Major - now Sir John - in the  election and Margaret Thatcher in  answered % of questions they were asked.   Mrs May proved even more evasive at Prime Minister’s Questions, according to the research led by Professor Peter Bull of the university’s department of psychology.   During  sessions of PMQs in -, she was said to have answered only % of the questions from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn . The previous year, however, Mr Cameron answered % of Mr Corbyn’s questions over the course of  sessions.  Prof Bull, who presents his findings to the British Psychological Society’s annual conference in Harrogate, accused Mrs May of honing a series of “covert” tactics for dodging questions.  “Of particular interest are her distinctive techniques of ignoring awkward questions, without even acknowledging that a question has been asked, which accounts for % of her evasive responses,” he said.  “She also responds to her own modied versions of questions, not to the version that was originally posed - % of her evasive responses are of this kind.” Prof Bull warned the dodging could undermine trust and may have fuelled the ongoing Brexit crisis.  “If Theresa May fails to answer questions, or even to acknowledge that she is not answering questions, to what extent can she be believed ” he said. “The consequent decline in her political credibility and authority has arguably played an important ongoing role in the current Brexit crisis.”  Mrs May’s spokesman hit back saying: “The Prime Minister has spent very signicant amounts of time in the House of Commons, not just at Prime Minister’s Questions but throughout the Brexit process, answering the questions of MPs.”  The Tory leader is expected to make her first public comments for three weeks today when she appears in the Commons for Prime Minister’s Questions.    She missed last week’s showdown - scheduled to be the first after the Easter break - so she could attend the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKee in Belfast.  Askedthe PM had been “hiding”, her spokesman pointed out going to the reporter’s funeral in Northern Ireland was “the right thing to do”.  He said she had “been out campaigning on a number of occasions in recent days”, adding: “She will be in the House of Commons tomorrow and then she will taking questions from the Liaison Committee.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory admits dwp dropped ball","story":"NewsTory admits DWP dropped the ball over massive delay to Universal Credit reportShamefaced minister Alok Sharma told MPs \"absolutely we dropped the ball on that\" and \"certainly it was a mistake\"ShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video dwp-tory-admits-dropped-ball-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A Tory minister has admitted the DWP dropped the ball after a scathing internal report on Universal Credit was published almost  MONTHS late.Shamefaced Alok Sharma made the confession after a November  report on the six-in-one benefit was only published in April .It showed % of people who moved from Tax Credits to Universal Credit due to a change in circumstances struggled financially at least some of the time.Yet the findings are now well out of date as several changes have been made since .

Mr Sharma claimed the Department for Work and Pensionsmade a mistake in withholding the report from the public for more than a year. He did not explain how the scandal happened, but told MPs on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee: Certainly it was a mistake. We should have published this earlier, I’m not going to defend that.” The Employment Minister added: In terms of that report, to be very up front with you, absolutely we collectively dropped the ball on that. “The intention was that should have been published earlier.  “We are making sure we have systems in place to make sure we don’t make that kind of mistake again.” It came as MPs quizzed chiefs on the movement of millions of existing benefit claimants onto Universal Credit.

Business director Hannah Corne, , felt her vision becoming blurry in late February and decided to get an eye test because she wears glasses to drive. The mum-of-two, from Leeds, went to her optician, but staff immediately booked her a hospital appointment. The next day ophthalmic doctors at St James’s Hospital told Hannah they thought she had a cancer in her eye, called an ocular melanoma. Further tests at the specialist eye centre at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, confirmed it was a two centimetre incredibly rare ciliary body cancer, meaning the tumour grows from behind the coloured part of the eye.    The best option for such a large cancer was to remove the eyeball. In the space of a just a WEEK stunned Hannah had been told she had cancer and she would lose half her vision, and on Wednesday March  surgeons removed her left eye. “They confirmed it was a melanoma, and not only that, it was a large ciliary body melanoma, which is the worst type you can have in your eye and the best option is to have your eye removed, Hannah said. “Because of the location and size of the tumour they said this is what the oncology team would recommend. Not only in the space of a week had I been told that I had cancer, but also now that I was going to lose my eye at . “It was all really quick and really shocking. On March  I remember going under and the surgeon wiping tears from my face as I told him to make sure I came back for my children.”    Hannah lives with her husband Andy, , and daughter Florence, aged seven, and six-year-old Bertie. She runs a not for profit organisation called Mini Mermaids which inspires young girls, and boys, to have confidence and feel comfortable in their own bodies through mindful practices and running. Incredibly, despite being diagnosed with cancer and losing part of her sight in less than a month, Hannah has picked herself up with amazing bravery. Even before the operation she began a blog to help her deal with the swirling thoughts in her head, called ‘Me, myself and eye – a not very remarkable story about my journey’. The moving often humorous blog, tells how Hannah copes with physical changes such as not being able judge distances out walking or running, to having problems knocking over her gin and tonic glass. It handles the mentally dark moments of coming to terms with cancer but also shows how as a mum Hannah is determined to keep going for her family, eventhey do still leave shoes on the floor which she now can’t see. She also tells how within weeks of her operation Hannah has been out enjoying her favourite sport of running again, as well as climbing and boxing. But despite her positive attitude there are also moments when what has happened does hit home. Hannah said: “The pressure bandage came off about a week after surgery and that’s when my husband started bathing my left eye for me.    “That’s the first time I started to feel quite panicked because my left eye was open, but I couldn’t see anything. That was really the time it hit home that I had lost the vision in my left eye, and it was never going to come back. “I am quite an up person though, I’m wearing eye patches, and writing the blog and trying to get back into things that I do, although I run like a drunk person now. “It was a week and a day since my operation when I went for my first run, I was feeling really low. When I had my second child I suffered with some post-natal depression and it was running that helped me and I wanted to get back to it. “A friend who I was supposed to run with me couldn’t make it, but I made the decision to go on my own, what’s the worst that could happen, I’ve got my phone, I can call people, I can get the bus homeneeds be. “I put my trainers on and got out of the door, it felt like, imagine you’re a dog and you’ve injured your leg and you can’t go out for a while and then you’re recovered and let off the lead for the first time. “It was just absolutely amazing, I was running around the park just high-fiving everyone. People must have thought I was crazy. I actually ended up running seven miles at a decent pace.”    Hannah said the confidence gained from the run has been the catalyst to restart many of her other favourite activities. Although some things she admits she now can’t do. She said: “I can’t wear eyeliner because you’ve got to shut your eye to put eyeliner on the top, so I go without now. And when I first put mascara on, I put it on my nose, but I’ve got that down to a fine art now. “Everyone says to me I’ll get used to it and I’ll adapt, but I always think aposwhen am I going to get used to it apos Night time is when it really bothers me and I’m not sleeping, I’m getting through a lot of Netflix box sets.” Bizarrely Hannah said despite now wearing colourful eye patches it is usually only taxi drivers and children who ask her about her eye. She said: “I took my little boy to get his hair cut and it’s the same person who cuts his hair, but they didn’t say a word. Even though I’m now suddenly wearing this big eye patch, nobody asks.    “Apart from when I’m getting a taxi, they immediately say ‘ooo love what have you done ’ and I actually say, thanks for asking, I’m happy to talk about it. “When I went back to boxing, they said aposwhat have you done  Are you OK  Can you box apos And after that they got me straight back into it, doing a right cross, left hook, right uppercut and away we went. “Sometimes when a kid asks me, I tell them my eye has been plucked out by a pirate and I’m now called Captain Corne, and their faces are a picture. “I think people who don’t ask think they are being polite, but I do find it quite odd, and very British.” As a mum Hannah said the first thing she thought about when she was diagnosed was her children. She said: “My first thought is that I have to be around for them, even when I was diagnosed and going into surgery, I was thinking about them. “With Florence, she has heard the word cancer before and always associated it with people dying, and I wanted her to know I wasn’t going to die at this point, and she seems to be OK. Bertie is a bit younger and doesnapost understand as much. “But between them they are still leaving shoes in the middle of the floor or hollering for breakfast yoghurt and just being kids, which is all normal, and they still expect me to catch a ball when they throw it at me. Through Hannah’s work as UK Director of Mini Mermaids she has found the methods she uses to give youngsters confidence are now helping her. She continued: “We work with girls and we look at the body as whole to find out how we feel about ourselves. And I’ve really found that useful for me now. “Especially when it comes to body image, it’s taken me years before this operation to feel comfortable in my own skin and to feel comfortable with what some people think are imperfections, but which I think are actually perfectly me. “People have asked me how do you feel about yourself now you’ve only got one eye, and they are really asking about how do you feel about the way you look  Which isn’t what it’s about. “Essentially what’s happening to me has got nothing to do with what I look like, it’s about how I feel, I’m thinking actually I’m amazed at the resilience of my body and my mind to come back from this. “It’s just another battle scar on this crazy journey of le that I am going through, and I’m not going to shy away from the fact I’ve got one eye, I’m going to be proud of it, and make people aware of Ocular melanoma and encourage people to have their eyes checked. “I’m not going to let it stop me or change my opinion about myself and my body.”    In May Hannah will have her first ocular fitting for a prosthetic, and then pictures will be taken of her right eye which will be used to paint a new left eye. Mr Sachin Salvi, Consultant Ophthalmologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: “Melanoma inside the eye is extremely rare, with five people in every million developing the condition. “The condition typically affects people between the ages of  to , although we have treated patients as young as  years. “The ocular oncology service at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals is one of only four national specialist eye cancer services in the UK and the only centre to treat all types of adult eye cancers under one roof. “We have a large team of specialists and nurses who have over  years’ experience in the treatment of rare eye cancers. “As with all cancers, early detection is key and the majority of patients are able to have radiation treatment to preserve their eyethe tumour has not spread or become too large to operate on. “Hannah is an incredibly brave person and her positive attitude has helped her deal courageously with the impact of her eye cancer, first facing surgery and then learning to adjust to le with one eye as well as her cancer diagnosis. “She has shown great empathy and courage by writing her blog to raise awareness and offering such support to other patients facing similar experiences.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains biggest family radfords give","story":"NewsBritains biggest family The Radfords give glimpse inside gorgeous homeSue, , and Noel Radford, , may be proud parents to  children - but they still manage to keep their house in Morecambe, Lancashire, immaculateShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video watch-clip-radford-familys-house-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritainaposs biggest family have given a glimpse inside their home with, leaving fans in awe at how gorgeous and tidy it is.

She spent more than  minutes chatting to donors, supporters, architects and staff from the charity. Speaking about the building the duchess told one group: It must be so wonderful for you to see it. The organisation brings together experts and leading practitioners in neuroscience, mental health, social care, child development, research and education - working alongside children, young people and their families.     The centre will also provide training for professionals and postgraduate teaching. It also includes Pears Family School, a school for children who have been excluded between the ages of -. Kate, who will celebrate daughter Princess Charlotteaposs fourth birthday tomorrow, will visit the school and meet children and their families and take part in a music class during her visit. Anna Freud was the pioneer of child psychoanalysis and daughter of the famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. She originally set up the the Hampstead War Nurseries in  in response to the social and emotional upheaval faced by children in wartime, and over the decades it developed into a centre of teaching and research and a major service provider.    Professor Peter Fonagy, chief executive of the Anna Freud Centre, said: “Childhood mental health disorders have reached unacceptably high levels. As a society, we have a moral imperative to drive change on children’s mental health. “Opening our new building is our contribution to this – giving parents, communities and practitioners the skills, knowledge and support to help children build their health and wellbeing, and the confidence to seek professional help when needed. Earlier this week Kate was rewarded with a special gt for her services to the Crown.  The Queen has given Duchess of Cambridge, , a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order , which is the monarchaposs highest seal of approval. Buckingham Palace made announcement on Kate and Prince Williamaposs eighth wedding anniversary. Awards under the Royal Victorian Order are made personally by The Queen, who last week turned  . They also are not made on the recommendations of Downing Street. The RVO has five classes from member to Knight or Dame Grand Cross, and Kate follows in the footsteps of the Duchess of Cornwall, who received the same honour in the Queenaposs  Diamond Jubilee year.

Jay Barham and orce  mum-of-two Linda fell in love in  - despite their  year age gap. While many of their friends and family told them it would never last, the happy couple, from Harwich, Essex, have now enjoyed  years together. Now Jay, , and Linda, , have said the secret to their happy le is to never go to bed on an argument and spend lots of time together. Jay said: Linda has been called a child snatcher, Iaposve been called a granny basher. Weaposve been called names in the street, and sometimes people think she is my mum. But we donapost care what people say.    Our marriage has lasted a lot longer than many others and we are still very much in love. Jay was a trainee youth worker when he first met council youth worker Linda. The couple say they were instantly attracted and bonded during driving lessons she gave him and through their love of music. Jay added: For eight weeks she was helping me learn how to drive. And then one time a track just started playing and we just kissed. For the le of me I canapost remember which one but it had to be Elton John because heaposs our favourite. It was completely unspoken up until that point, but as it happened it was like the sun just came out and it was a shock to both of us. It took Jay, who had had three previous serious girlfriends before Linda, three days to get over the shock of the kiss before asking her out on a date.    At the time Linda, from Hardcourt, Essex, was concerned for the feelings she felt for a boy the same age as her son Simon. She said: I just thought: aposthis is wrongapos, I felt awful. But I was orced for five years, my children were all grown up and knew that it just felt right Lindaaposs children Alan, , and Simon, , were shell shocked at the idea of the relationship but decided that as long as mum happy, nothing  matters. For Jayaposs parents, who were over a decade younger than his new girlfriend, they thought it was just a flash in the pan. Jay said: They were okay about it, they just thought: aposOh well it will lastit lasts.apos We were more worried about how my nan would react, but she was fantastic about it. In spite of doubtful friends that were certain the relationship would never workout, Jay and Linda got married eight months after meeting in July . Jay said: We got married at Colchester Registry office on Friday the th, and everyone told us that we shouldnapost as it was an unlucky day.    And then my suit didnapost fit, our car broke down, the ring didnapost fit and it got to the point that Iaposd just wear trackies and a top Linda said: We were happy to get a bus to the wedding, but our family stepped in and sorted us out Jay and Linda have worked together for most of their married lives at an Asda bakery and are now opening a small cafe together near their home in Hardcourt, Essex. Jayaposs mother Valerie, who died in , was  years younger than Linda but the two were still extremely close. He said: Linda and my mum gelled really well, there were absolutely no problems. My dad has a really good relationship with Linda, he actually describes her as aposthe daughter he never hadapos. We all go on holiday together and weaposre incredibly close. In fact, bemused onlookers always mistake that Jayaposs dad Stephen and Linda as his parents.    Of course people always think Iaposm their child and theyaposre my parents, but we just laugh at it. Itaposs understandable, all sorts of people ask all sorts of questions. But Iaposve never thought about age, I just think about the woman I love. Jay and Linda are un-bothered by peopleaposs comments about their extreme age gap. Jay said People have said horrible things to us in the street. The couple have even had their car windows smashed in what they assume to be an attack on their marriage. Jay said: We just got on with it, even now people frown on it. I always reply to people like that asking how many orces theyaposve had. Most marriages have all split up, regardless of their age. Linda thinks there is some hypocrisy in judging older woman more so than older men that have young partners.    If itaposs a man then youaposre doing well for yourself, but thenyou are a woman then youaposre disgusting and frowned upon. We just love each other, we havenapost done this for fame or for money, we just love and think about each other. When the couple first got married, Linda was still able to have children but Jay was never keen in being a parent. I never wanted to be a father, Iaposm one of those people that just keep the toys to myself. Iaposm just not the parent type, I much prefer having grandchildren as you get to give them back. Linda has seven grandchildren between the ages of four weeks and  years-old. Jay says that he never thinks about the likelihood Linda will die before him: I treat everyday as my last so thereaposs no point in worrying about numbers. Personally the biggest positive about being married to an older woman is the civility, being able to speak about feelings and not pushing them under.    We have adapted our lives [for Lindaaposs age] for example instead of walking ten miles weaposll go for a ride in the car. Although they have adapted their lives in some aspects, they certainly havenapost changed anything in the bedroom. Jay wasnapost a virgin when he starting Linda and he described himself as well experienced. You donapost just stop having sex when you reach . She still has that drive, I donapost know why people think you die sexually at . The secret to a happy marriage, according to Jay, is simply about loving one another. I think itaposs spending so much time together, we love each other and we do everything together. The only think we argue about is the cat, and even then we never go to bed without sorting everything out.

Feezan Hameed Choudhary was jailed for  years in  for leading a aposvishingapos fraud which conned  RBS and Lloyds customers out of £mn. The -year-old is now back in court as as police attempt to seize his £.million profits. The silver-tongued crook was dubbed aposThe Voiceapos by police because he put on Scottish, Welsh and posh English accents while posing as officials from the banksapos fraud departments on the phone. Nicknamed aposFizzyapos, the Glasgow-based fraudster raked in more than £m a month and splashed out on luxury motors including a Bentley and a Lamborghini.  He was so obsessive about his motors he flew car polishers , miles from Scotland to Pakistan to polish his fleet of Porsche Cayennes outside his luxury villa in Lahore. Choudhary, formerly of Albert Road, Glasgow, was jailed after he admitted conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money. He ed to Southwark Crown Court for a confiscation hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Edward Franklin, prosecuting, said after taking into account expenditure during the course of the fraud Choudharyaposs benefit was £m.  Of that £m we conclude that £.m is recoverable. If he has it, and it is up to him to provehe does not. The defendant liked to conceal that he owned any property by getting other people to purchase it,apos said Mr Franklin. It is for the defendant to prove that he does not, andhe can not prove that he does not, it is for the defendant to pay the consequences.  Mr Franklin told the court that, according to one of the other fraudsters, Muhammad Azhar, the mastermind received up to £.m a month during he scam. He said: If Azhar is right the defendant could have received around £m in the period of the indictment alone. He said that Azharaposs evidence was that Choudhary paid a fortune into bank accounts in Lahore, Pakistan and owned a villa with live-in chefs and valets. He said his family lived in it, that they employed servants and cooks. Muhammad Akram also claimed to visit the defendantaposs Pakistan address. He told the court that this account contrasted with Choudharyaposs own account that his family in Pakistan now live in a two bedroom maisonette, costing £ a month to rent.  He said: The defendant can not be right when he says he has nothing overseas. He canapost be right when he says all the spending took place in the UK. Azhar estimated that Choudhary spent aposaround £mapos in spending sprees in Harrods alone, using other people to buy Rolexes and other luxury goods on his behalf. Mr Franklin said that Choudhary not only produced a music video for Pakistani popstar Bilal Saeed but also had him play at his engagement party. Choudhary and several accomplices were eventually caught after ripping off  victims in the biggest cyber-fraud the politan Police has ever seen. Stolen funds were moved to a bank account aposat the touch of a buttonapos and then distributed across a number of other accounts before the cash was withdrawn by aposmoney mulesapos.  Legitimate bank phone numbers were used to confuse victims, thanks to someone on the inside. Pitman Blackstock Solicitors were fleeced out of £,,. after getting a call from aposPeterapos claiming he was calling from the security department Lloyds Bank. In another instance three quarters of a million pounds was transferred in seconds. Choudhary used aliases including aposSimon Hughes or Matthew Fraserapos and would tell unwitting customers they had been hacked by apossomeone in Aberdeen called Stevenson or Kingapos. He was the aposleader and prime moverapos and made almost all the calls, making sure that they appeared to be coming from a location that didnapost arise suspicion. The gang would only transfer up to £, at a time as banks would instantly question anything above that. Victims have spoken of how they were apostaken in very easilyapos by Choudhary and were left feeling aposdevastatedapos and apostraumatisedapos.  The scam was smashed in a series of police raids in Glasgow and the West Midlands last year. Choudhary went as far as making calls to victims from Pakistan while on holiday during the summer of . He also bragged of having a number of other businesses including a restaurant in London and dealing in aposfast carsapos and bought himself properties in Motherwell. Choudhary was finally snared after trying to board a flight from Paris to Pakistan with a fake passport in November  before being ed to the UK to face justice. The confiscation hearing continues.

The government is advising families with dferent surnames to take supporting documentation to airports with them in order to prove they are related. Earlier this year the Home Office shared an image on Twitter urging parents to take birth or adoption certicates on holiday with them in order to speed up the passport control process. They added: Families with dferent surnames may be asked questions to establish their relationship. The tweet was met with a great deal of indignation from parents on the social  and Labour MP Stella Creasy compared the UK to Gilead - a fictional patriarchal dystopia in novel The Handmaidaposs Tale. One Twitter user responded: I am fundamentally against this. My husband and I have dferent surnames. And our son bears my husbandaposs. Not unusual for parents to have dferent surnames in the st Century. Appalling stuff by @sajidjavid and the Home Office. Another wrote: Just to clary women who chose not to take their husbandaposs surname or have children with a partner they are not married to will be subject to increased border measures. This is what freedom looks like under a Tory government  Straight out of Gilead.    Why might families with dferent surnames be questioned at airports  After sharing the original message the Home Office added a follow-up tweet to explain why the procedure is so important, writing: We have a duty to safeguard children and to prevent people trafficking, child sexual exploitation and other crimes. That is why Border Force officers sometimes need to ask additional questions. On the governmentaposs website the situation is explained further: Every day thousands of children arrive at the UK border, manyfrom holiday with their family or with family friends. The safety and welfare of every child is of utmost importance to us and sometimes we may ask a few questionsan adult is not the child’s parent, or has a dferent family name. For more information on Border Forceaposs policy, there is a leaflet parents can access on the governmentaposs website.  Advice for families travelling with dferent surnames The government advises that,you are travelling with children who have a dferent surname, you may be asked questions at the border to prove your relationship. You can help by bringing with you the following documents:a birth or adoption certicate showing your relationship with the child orce or marriage certicatesyou’re the parent but have a dferent surname from the child a letter from the child’s parent or social worker giving permission for the child to travel with youLast year, a lawyer warned mums and dads they could aposunknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border controlaposthey fail to take the right documents with them, the Manchester Evening News reported. One of those was Wigan mum Hannah Marshall, who was stopped with her daughter Lilly at London Stansted Airport when they ed from a holiday in Denmark. At the time Hannah, , wasnapost married to Lillyaposs dad Scott, so while Lilly had the surname Marshall, Hannahaposs was still Thomas.  Hannah said While queuing I went to one desk with my daughter and my partner and his mum went to another desk for passport control. They looked at both mine and my daughteraposs passports then asked me how I knew the little girl and when I said it was my daughter they asked why I did not have the same last name. They asked my daughter who I was to her and thataposs when my partner came over and explained that sheaposs his daughter too and as we werenapost married she had his last name.    They told us that my partner should have taken her through passport control because I would need to prove she was my daughter. They checked my partneraposs passport to prove she held the same last name and then let us through. It can, however, be dficult for a person to prove they are a childaposs parent on the spot, unless they are carrying the right documents. David Connor heads up the family department at Woodcocks Haworth and Nuttall Solicitors, who have offices in Bury and Lancashire and says parents need to plan ahead to avoid being caught out. He said: People need to take extra caution when holidaying with children who don’t share their surname as they could unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border control. It’s vital you have the correct documentation to hand or it could derail your trip. For separated families, you’ll need evidence of approval from your child’s other parent, but remember to seek approval from everyone with parental responsibility – this may include grandparents too. He added: You’ll also need a copy of any Child Arrangement Order which proves you have court approval to take the child abroad. It’s vital that all evidence marries up and this is where orced parents are often caught out, particularly women who revert back to their maiden name. A change of name deed will help here, which can be supplied by a solicitor. Take a copy of your child’s birth certicate with you too to prove who you are. You wonapost need permission from an absent parenttheyaposre not on the childaposs birth certicate, butan absent parent has passed away you may be required to take the death certicate with you.

Chloe Storer, , was taking a picture of her -month-old son Jake when she spotted the right side of his face appeared to be paralysed. The worried mum was concerned Jake had suffered some kind of stroke and showed medics the picture during a hospital appointment.Jake had been to ious hospital appointments since birth after he stopped growing at  weeks and had to be delivered over a month early.He was eventually diagnosed with micro duplication q. - a condition so rare that only  people are diagnosed worldwide.Jakeaposs disorder can cause facial paralysis and it could even leave him with learning dficulties , heart conditions and hearing loss.   The mum-of-one, said: It becomes more obvious when he smiles or eats, and initially he had problems with his eye. I hadnapost noticed his face appeared to be drooping on the one side until I was taking a photograph of him. Theyaposre not sure why his face is paralysed, and whether itaposs linked but because the condition is so rare, weaposre still learning about it. Initially I didnapost notice but it becomes more obvious when he smiles or when he cries. With hindsight, Jake was premature and he was five weeks early. Heaposd stopped growing at  weeks and there had been no explanation for that from the doctors. They made the decision to induce early, and they began testing on him straight away - theyaposd assumed heaposd had a stroke initially but there was more to it.    When they first told me his diagnosis, it sounded like a jumble of letters, and I felt very much out of my depth - after all only  people have it worldwide. As far as we know, Jakeaposs future is completely unknown - the doctors predict things like learning dficulties, heart conditions and hearing loss, Iaposm hopeful it wonapost affect him too much, but Iaposm still learning all the time. Right now, I notice that Jake stands out because heaposs very small and he has delayed milestones. He only started walking this week, and he couldnapost roll or sit up at the normal times. He sometimes struggles eating, and when he smiles, I notice his face, itaposs almost like it could be a facial nerve. Chloe has since decided to begin her own support group in the hope of finding other aposchromo cutiesapos after struggling to find any mum and baby groups she could join. She plans to find other parents and caters for those who have children with rare chromosomes disorders.    Chloe added: Jake initially couldnapost close his right eye and I donapost think he can feel much as he sticks his finger in his eye. The most help Iaposve had has been through the charity UNIQUE who can answer some of my questions, and provide information and leaflets. But I want Jake to find someone like him - most groups are five years and over, and I just wanted to find someone in my situation. It would be a leline - there would be someone to empathise rather than sympathise. Sometimes I struggle with it, and what the future may hold for Jake, but when I see him hit milestones that we didnapost expect, like when he started walking last week, it hits home. Jakeaposs condition is unknown but he keeps defying expectations. Heaposs happy, heaposs always smiling and heaposs so determined. He wants to do more, and he even exceeds what I expect from him - nothing phases him or me anymore. No matter what the future holds, Jake and I will take it on together.  "},{"url":null,"title":"woman ran last 18 miles","story":"NewsWoman ran last  miles of the London Marathon with a broken ankleSiobhan OKeefe, , suffered the inury a third of the way into the epic  mile race - but baffled doctors by still finishingShareCommentsByJack Longstaff:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsSiobhan OKeeffe during the marathon at mile  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman ran  miles of the London Marathon with a broken ankle - wrapping her leg in bandages to cross the finish line. Siobhan OaposKeeffe, , suffered the injury eight miles into the  mile race then continued for more than four hours with her fibula bone snapped in half. She fought back the tears and battled on through excruciating pain to finish in just over six hours. But that was after the plucky runner had to stop after eight miles to get her ankle bandaged up by first aiders.     It started hurting after about four miles but it just got worse and worse, said Siobhan, from Surrey. I had to stop after eight miles. It felt bruised and really heavy, I thought it was sprained. I didnapost think itaposd be possible to run on a broken ankle. The pain was unbearable but all I wanted to do was finish. I had tears in my eyes. The adrenaline just kicked in. Siobhan was forced to stop after eight miles when she came across St Johnaposs Ambulance medics. She says the lower part of her leg was swollen and red, and was advised to stop running by first aiders.  But determined Siobhan, who was running in aid of the Children With Cancer charity, says dropping out of the race was never an option. She has raised £, for the charity with her work colleague, Sarah Hopkins, , and with her ankle now wrapped in bandages, picked herself up and started running again. Siobhan, who initially wanted to complete the marathon in around five hours, said: The St. Johnaposs Ambulance people said aposmaybe you should stop nowapos. But I needed to get to the end. All of my family were there and I was running for charity. I didnapost want to let anyone down. The pain was really bad. I had to walk a bit but did carry on running. I ended up running with the pacer.  I was in a group of people and that really helped me along. I knew I wasnapost going to get the time I wanted so I just ended up wanting to finish at all. I was gutted. I think Iaposd be able to hit my target. Siobhan had spent four months training to run the marathon on Sunday. She had nailed her race preparation and was buzzing with excitement on the start line of one of the worldaposs most famous races.

I joked with another runner thatfelt as though I was running on a broken ankle.    I feel like I have unfinished business with the marathon. I did say never again when I finished but Iaposll never say never. Siobhan says the pain never went away and was only temporarily numbed by the roar of the crowds as she ran down The Mall towards the finish line. But even after picking up her finisheraposs medal - Siobhan says she didnapost go to AE until the next morning. Siobhan went home to celebrate with her family and even went to sleep with her ankle still broken - before waking up at am in agony. She went along to AE at West Middlesex Hospital in the early hours of Monday morning.    She was taken for an X-ray which revealed her fibula bone has snapped near her ankle joint - leaving doctors baffled at how she managed to complete the race. Siobhan said: The orthopedic surgeon said he had no idea how I ran with it. He said it was a trauma break. He couldnapost believe it. Everyone at hospital said Iaposm amazing for what I did. No one can believe it. Siobhanaposs ankle is now encased in a cast and will find out on Fridayshe needs an operation. If not, she will need to wear the cast for up to six weeks but her recovery may go on for longersurgery is required.

Largely regarded by the scientic community as a myth, the Yeti is part of Nepali folklore and is said to live high in the snow-capped Himalayas. In a tweet accompanied by pictures, the Indian army said it had sighted footprints measuring  by  inchesclose to a camp near Mount Makalu, Nepal, on April . For the first time, an Indian Army Mountaineering Expedition Team has sited Mysterious Footprints of mythical beast aposYetiapos it said in a tweet.  Located on the border between Nepal and China, Makalu is the fth-highest mountain in the world. It stands near the Makalu-Barun valley, a remote wilderness that has also been surveyed by researchers hunting for the Yeti. Daniel C. Taylor, who has extensively explored the Makalu-Barun area and written a book on the mystery of the Yeti, said the footprints were likely those of bears.  If that is the footprint of an animal or a single animal, itaposs the size of a dinosaur, he said. He added that repeated measurements of the footprints were required to ascertain their origin. One needs to really confirm those measurements of the footprint size because we know for sure that there are no dinosaurs living in the Barun valley. Tales of a wild hairy beast roaming the Himalayas have captured the imagination of climbers in Nepal since the s, prompting many, including Sir Edmund Hillary, to go looking for the creature.  In , Japanese climbers ing from a mountain in western Nepal said they had seen footprints, which they thought belonged to the Yeti. And although they carried long-lens cameras, video cameras and telescopes, they hadnapost seen or taken any photographs of the creature. But scientists have found little evidence of the Yetiaposs existence so far.  In , a group of international researchers studied multiple purported Yeti samples collected from across the Himalayan region and concluded they belonged to bears. In , two men in the United States said they had found the remains of a half-man, half-ape, which was eventually revealed to be a rubber gorilla suit.

Yellow Vests protesters faced down French riot police along with members of the so-called Black Bloc anti-capitalist movement. By pm in Paris, there had been  arrests in the city, most for public order offences related to the rioting. The worst early violence was outside La Rotonde, President Emmanuel Macron’s favourite restaurant in Montparnasse.  Black Bloc agitators were throwing stones and other missiles at us, and we had to charge, said a CRS riot control officer at the scene.    Tear gas has also been deployed to bring order to the situation. The situation is very tense. There have been  arrests reported so far. Huge parts of Paris were in lockdown as an unprecedented  police officers were drafted on to the streets. The massive security presence was announced by Interior Minister Christophe Castaner who said: There’s no question of dramatising anything, it is a question of being prepared. May Day is a Bank Holiday and a traditional time for Left-Wing workers to rise up against the ruling elite. In France, there have been around  police, gendarmes and soldiers deployed for recent Yellow Vest demonstrations that have descended into anarchy.

There are fears that they will target public monuments, banks and high-end shops, while also threatening the kind of fires that have become common at protests. This has led to the Champs Elysee – the most famous avenue in France – being closed, along with Paris’s governmental and diplomatic districts. The Ile de la Cite - the island where Notre Dame Cathedral is situated was also in lockdown following the blaze that almost destroyed it last month.    Armoured cars and water cannons were also being deployed next to historic buildings such as the Efel Tower and Arc de Triomhe. The Vests – who are named after their high visibility motoring jackets – started as an online group calling for an end to high fuel prices last November. They have been demonstrating in major cities such as Paris every Saturday since, and are now calling for President Emmanuel Macron to resign. He went on television last week to outline a package of economic reforms worth around £.billion, but it has failed to pacy his critics.  As Mr Macron prepares for European Parliament elections this month, he wants to show he is capable of maintaining law and order in his own country.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals. I was a farmer at that time and was told they were perfectly safe.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing

those in need.Dominic Taddei, who grew up in Hawick and spent almost five years serving his country with the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, decided to leave the Borders behind in .He sold off many of his possessions to fund a two-year volunteering mission across Africa and has ed with a renewed sense of perspective.During his travels across Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda Dominic witnessed violent election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude to le since ing to the UK in March.He added: ldquoAfter selling most of my things to help fund this mission I now own very few items and the ones I do own I appreciate more.ldquoI appreciate things like electricity, running water, showers and fridges.ldquoI now live a fairly simple le and, to be honest, I feel happier doing so."},{"url":null,"title":"how-much-has-duncs-big-quiz-raised-so-far","story":"ONE of the biggest quizzes to ever take place in the Scottish Borders has now raised well over pound, for charity since

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

Itrsquos not just saving us money, itrsquos making money too.Duncan Stewart with the hydropower turbine, which is generating energy after being installed in .The engineering treasure draws its water from the nearby Fithie Burn, which was dammed by workmen using shovels, horses and carts in the months after the First World War.However, water-driven power at the site dates back even earlier ndash to more than  years ago, when there was a mill with a water wheel in the area.The ft high, ft long turbine was originally installed in a workshop serving Duntrune Estate, powering a large circular saw and sending electricity to Duntrune House, nearby Craighill House and Burnside House, the former estate managerrsquos home.When the Stewarts moved to Burnside House almost  years ago, the turbine was still providing electricity to the property ndash albeit via a quickly dismantled hazardous DC connection ndash alongside a mains connection.However, it eventually ground to a halt and was mothballed while the couple opted for more ldquomodern mains supply electricity and an oil-fired range cooker and boiler.It lay rusting until Mr Stewart met television presenter and engineer Lieutenant-Colonel Dick Strawbridge at an event and happened to mention the turbine lurking in his shed.ldquoHe said, lsquoget it fixed, it could be your pensionrsquo, recalled Mr Stewart.Read more:Energy giant plans hefty investment in windfarms and car chargers in ScotlandInspired, he dusted grime from the rusty turbinersquos nameplate and discovered it was a Turgo turbine, manufactured by Cumbria-based Gilbert Gilkes  Gordon Ltd. Papers related to its commission and invoices confirmed it had been installed in  ndash the same year the revolutionary turbine was designed by Eric Crewdson, who had outlined its features while serving in the trenches of the war.Crewdson conceived the idea of a side-entry impulse turbine capable of running at twice the speed of a Pelton water-wheel turbine, with a higher efficiency across a broad flow range.Within months of ing from the war, his concept had been developed and the first Turgo turbine installed at a property in Crieff.However, it is no longer operational ndash making the Stewartsrsquo refurbished and repainted turbine the oldest operational example version of its type in Scotland.The refurbishment was carried out by the original manufacturers, while Mr Stewart set about removing a build-up of silt from the burn.He added: ldquoThe turbinersquos governor alone, which controls the flow of water and is a beautul piece of engineering, must have weighed half a tonne ndash the new one only weighs around half a pound. Now it all works beautully.The savings ndash and earnings ndash have been signicant. Hydropower is used to heat the propertyrsquos water and radiators, enabling the Stewarts to reduce oil consumption, as well as powering the log splitter to feed the stove. ldquoI now use about , to , litres of oil when a house this size would normally require , litres, Mr Stewart added, ldquowhile I get paid for whatever energy is generated regardless of how much actually goes to the Grid.ldquoItrsquos now part of our le.The only downside, he adds, isa dry spell hits and the local farmers opt to use additional local water to irrigate their crops, leaving an insufficient flow to power the system.Hydropower has recently surged in popularity, with dozens of community-run schemes now either in operation or in the planning stages.Hannah Smith, senior policy manager at Scottish Renewables, said: ldquoHydropower is one of Scotlandrsquos great unsung heroes, using our notorious wet weather to provide  per cent of Scotlandrsquos gross electricity demand while reducing the carbon emissions which cause climate change.ldquoMr and Mrs Stewartrsquos turbine is one of Scotlandrsquos oldest, and the fact it is still in service in its th year demonstrates how hydro delivers subsidy-free power long after support provided by government has ceased.She added that the Scottish Renewables Hydro Conference, in Perth on May , is set to explore further ways to ensure hydropower technologyrsquos role in the future energy landscape, particularly in wake of the closure of the Feed-in Tarf scheme earlier this month."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9419645.jpg?type=article-full","title":"neil-mackay-five-key-issues-the-yes-movement-must-address-if-it-wants-to-win-well","story":"The Yes movement, which in  was vibrant, optimistic and positive, has become typied by marching and shouting. Therersquos a sense that it has degenerated into a st century Grand Old Duke of York. People parade around towns waving Saltires, but to what avail  Whorsquos being convinced  Which minds are being changed :European election results can help Nicola Sturgeon in push for Scottish independenceEven worse than the gesture politics of pointless parades is the dominance of ugly voices among the grassroots. Itrsquos asthe tide went out after the first referendum ndash taking with it the upbeat, the persuasive, the intelligent, the charismatic ndash leaving behind the abusive, the vulgar, the reactionary, the dumb.Instead of the broad spectrum of informed voices and big ideas of , wersquore left with well-meaning marchers going nowhere, and internet trolls in their basements.Many of the problems stem from the vacuum left after defeat in  ndash the base wanted to keep on, but the SNP leadership chose slow, pragmatic, managerial politics. Whorsquod blame them  The SNP is a political party which wants to win office. It had to keep throwing red meat to the base with cries of ldquoindy is coming, while trying to maintain electoral appeal beyond independence voters.There are five key issues the Yes movement must look to ithopes to win independence well. The first is the tone of debate. Before the last referendum, many voters inherently distrustful of nationalism were brought over to Yes because it seemed open and embracing, it offered an alternative to failed Westminster. Progressives and centrists, and even some on the right, found a comfortable home as Yes voters. There was still a brittle, nasty online presence but it seemed of little intellectual importance.However, today, it appears asthis shrill minority is the dominant voice. The table seating needs readjustingtherersquos to be success. Put these petulant ldquoshouty people at the back of the room.This isnrsquot about silencing voices, they are free to say what they please, but those in leadership positions must speak up against this fringe which repels those considering a Yes vote. Stop following these people on social media, stop amplying their nasty messages ndash especiallyyoursquore in elected office.Which takes us to our second point ndash outreach. The Yes movement must once again start chasing voters and not talking to itself. Woo undecideds. Woo Unionists. Woo everyone. Self-congratulatory backslapping does nothing. Waving a Saltire in the face of Unionists wonrsquot win votes. Marching around a town wonrsquot change anyonersquos mind.Itrsquos not just that many in the base of whatrsquos left of the Yes movement arenrsquot attracting enough new voters to their side, some are wilfully deterring newcomers. The use of the derogatory term ldquoYoonto describe Unionists is guaranteed to offend and repel. Do some really believe insulting people and laughing at them will convert anyone  If MI wanted to cook up an intelligence operation to undermine Scottish independence they could do no better than many of the biggest online voices who claim to back Yes.A banner was unveiled outside the SNP conference at the weekend saying ldquoEngland get out of Scotland. We donrsquot need those who would try to make independence ugly. Scotland isnrsquot occupied. England isnrsquot an enemy. The banner was by a member of Scottish Resistance. Resisting who exactly  English paratroopers over Peebles  Get a le and get out of the way of people who really want to change this country for the better.:Scottish independence poll: One in five Scots back Nicola Sturgeons Indyref planItrsquos even worse when those not part of the lunatic fringe embarrass. Also at the SNP conference was Dave Thompson, former SNP MSP and chair of Voices for Scotland which is meant to be an ldquoinclusive\" Yes campaign group. Mr Thompson used Gaelic and Scots to introduce himself to delegates and added: ldquoApologies to those who do not have the two proper languages of Scotland. Really  It may have been a joke, but is this what we want to hear from a party which says it welcomes EU residents Thirdly, the Yes movement needs to get real over dficult questions. Voters have been exhausted and terried by Brexit. The SNP grassroots may want to scrap the pound, but itrsquos not a policy thatrsquos going to win new Yes voters ndash it will only scare them. When it comes to independence, undecideds are now worried about trade deals with England and a possible hard border. Brexit has made independence more dficult as itrsquos raised more questions.No-one sane wants independence to pile on more ision after Brexit. Thatrsquos why the creation of Citizensrsquo Assemblies, to work out the future of Scotland, is a welcome move. Take these big frightening questions directly to the people and to experts and letrsquos hear the evidence and the truth.

It recommended the introduction of six tests to guide that transition, one of which is the financial requirements of Scottish residents and businesses.ldquoThose tests were back by SNP conference on Saturday. Our position is clear. Until a new currency can be safely and established in the interests of the whole economy, the currency of an independent Scotland should continue to be the pound sterling.Mr Kelly said the SNP wanted to drop the pound immediately, devaluing savings, and would make Scottish families and business ldquosignicantly worse off.Mr Mackay, who was on the Growth Commission, said he was ldquodelighted the currency resolution he co-authored was passed - after activists added ldquoas soon as practicable.He said: ldquoWe have set out, in terms of currency, the position that we continue with the pound. Wersquove set out the tests that will guide our decisions.ldquoIt will be for an independent Scottish Parliament when the time is right -there is that change - based on the right economic position for Scotland.ldquoAnd those tests - fiscal sustainability, central bank credibility, financial requirements of Scottish residents and business, sufficiency of foreign exchange and financial reserves, fit to trade and investment patterns, and correlation of economic and trade cycle - these are sensible tests that would guide such a decision.Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoItrsquos only been three days since the vote at his conference and already the cabinet secretary is in full retreat from the position set out at that conference.He asked what work had been done on the ldquoextra transaction costs for Scots firms trading with the rest of the UK - Scotlandrsquos biggest export market - using a dferent currency.Mr Mackay said: ldquoWe will be keeping the pound on independence, and of course we can build our options as an independent country.ldquoWersquove set out the tests that we would apply to any potential change of currency.ldquoWersquove set out our preferred position.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Nerves of steel, calmness and sanity.

Opposition forces are hoping that Venezuelans angered by broadcast images of armoured vehicles ploughing into protesters and fed up with their nationrsquos dire humanitarian crisis will fill streets across the nation.In one blow to Mr Maduro, the head of Venezuelarsquos feared intelligence agency announced that he was breaking ranks with the embattled socialist leader. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Men look to recover usable parts from motorcycles burned during the previous dayrsquos clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in Caracas, Venezuela--ldquoWe need to keep up the pressure, Mr Guaido said. ldquoWe will be in the streets.The latest chapter in Venezuelarsquos political upheaval marks the most serious threat yet to Mr Madurorsquos contested rule. The leader, who has been relying on support from Russia and China, was largely absent as events unfolded on Tuesday. He finally emerged late in the evening to call the small-scale uprising a failed US-backed coup attempt.Speaking on state television, Mr Maduro said that the unrest had been quelled and that Venezuela would not succumb to right-wing forces intent on ldquosubmitting our country to a neocolonial economic domination model and enslaving Venezuela.ldquoNow you can see a Venezuela largely in peace, he proclaimed.Venezuelans waited to seethat remained the case. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A Boliian National Guard vehicle sprays opponents of Venezuelarsquos President Nicolas Maduro--The competing quests to solidy a hold on power produced one of the most stunning days yet for a country with the worldrsquos largest proven oil reserves but is struggling with an economic contraction that is worse than the US Great Depression.The turmoil on Tuesday began when Mr Guaido, flanked by a few dozen national guardsmen and some armoured crowd-control vehicles, released a three-minute video shot near the Carlota air base.In a surprise, Leopoldo Lopez, Mr Guaidorsquos political mentor and the nationrsquos most-prominent opposition activist, stood alongside him. Detained in  for leading a previous round of anti-government unrest, Mr Lopez said he had been released from house arrest by security forces following an order from Mr Guaido. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A supporter of Venezuelarsquos President Nicolas Maduro --ldquoI want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers, Mr Lopez declared.As the two opposition leaders coordinated actions from a motorway overpass, troops loyal to Mr Maduro fired tear gas from inside the adjacent air base.A crowd that quickly swelled to a few thousand scurried for cover, reappearing later with Mr Guaido at a plaza a few blocks away. A smaller group of masked youths stayed behind on the road, lobbing rocks and petrol bombs toward the air base and setting a government bus on fire.ldquoItrsquos now or never, said one of the young rebellious soldiers, his face covered in the blue bandanna worn by the few dozen insurgent soldiers. -- vw,vw,px, px\"An opponent of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro--Amid the mayhem, several armoured utility vehicles drove at full speed into the crowd. Two demonstrators, lying on the ground with their heads and legs bloodied, were rushed away on a motorcycle as the armoured vehicles sped away dodging petrol bombs thrown by the demonstrators.The head of a medical centre near the site of the street battles said doctors were treating over  people, about half of them with injuries suffered from rubber bullets. At least one person had been shot with live ammunition. The Venezuelan human rights group Provea said a -year-old man was fatally shot during an anti-government protest in the city of La Victoria.#EnVivo # | Mensaje al pueblo venezolano y al mundo, ante la nueva arremetida contra la Paz de la Patria. https:t.co hSrnPQjmmdash Nicolaacutes MaduroMay , Later Tuesday, Mr Lopez and his family sought refuge in the Chilean ambassadorrsquos residence and later moved to the Spanish Embassy. There were also reports that  soldiers who had been with Mr Guaido fled to Brazilrsquos diplomatic mission.Amid the unrest, Mr Madurorsquos military commanders went on state television to proclaim their loyalty.

This is a curious thing, as the proportion of people who actually have a boat is quite small. And yet there is research somewhere – or,there isn’t there should be – that shows that just about everyone at some time or another thinks “Wouldn’t it be nice to have a boat ” In many cases that is as far as it goes in others, the thought becomes a reality and le as they knew it changes forever. That is the essential revelation of boat ownership: nothing is ever the same.Of course, many people do not realise that having a boat is well within their means. Boats can obviously be extremely expensive: a good number of the sleek yachts to be seen in the cruising grounds of the Caribbean and the Mediterranean will not be the fruits of honest labour, but are the status symbols of hedge-fund managers and the like. These boats usually bring unhappiness, in a contemporary Faustian sense, perhaps, as the owners of super yachts will always be jealous of those whose yachts are bigger than theirs. They are just that sort of person. So when, from a tiny passing boat, or from the crowded  of a cheap and cheerful cruise ship, one sees these people basking on recliners on their pristine teak decks, do not imagine that they are happy. They are not.: Extraordinary le of Captain John Isbester recalled in new bookAt the other end of the spectrum – where most of us find ourselves – the urge to have a boat can be very easily satisfied. Small, knockabout boats are not at all expensive, especiallyacquired second-hand. A rowing boat may be bought for a few hundred pounds, as may a kayak. These are boats, and they float,put in the water the right way up. That is something you should perhaps be certain of before you put your newly acquired boat in the water. You should also familiarise yourself with bungs. These, to use land-based language, are the corks that boats have. You will find them down at the bottom, usually at the back . Make sure the cork is in, or your boat will fill with water and sink.You should also be careful what bit of water you put your boat into. Broadly speaking, water falls into two categories: saline and non-saline. Saline water is known as the sea, and it is very dangerous in every respect. Non-saline water is to be found in rivers, lochs and canals. You can put your boat into a river, but remember that when you put a boat in a river it tends to end up in a dferent place from the place in which it was first launched.A loch is a safe bet, although a large loch can get rough in the middlethe wind blows up. As a general rule, the wind is always blowing up, especially during those months in which it is not meant to be blowing up. There are also certain places where the wind is so strong that any form of boating is not recommended. Scotland is one of those places. Greece is another, where there is a wind called the Meltemi that blows up every afternoon.People who buy boats usually have no idea where they want to go in them. As a result, most boats you see in coastal waters are not going anywhere at all, but are simply circling about before theyto the place from which they set out. These places are called marinas, and are highly profitable to the people who run them. They have shops there known as chandleries that will sell you things for your boat. These things are regularly needed as most things already on boats will fall into the sea and require to be replaced.:  of the best sailing holidays in ScotlandThe crew of boats also regularly fall into the sea and require to be replaced. To limit the need for replacement, people wear le jackets. These are now triggered by exposure to water and are self-inflating. In Scotland, where we are all exposed to water in the atmosphere, these le jackets may inflate at odd moments. These occasions can be treated as practice drills.Many delights await youyou are fortunate enough to sail on a slightly larger boat . These are equipped with galleys, where food such as cold sausages, may be prepared. They also have toilets, known as the heads, which are designed to be ecologically sensitive and therefore do not work.Calling in on a harbour in one’s boat is a very particular pleasure. Medical attention will usually be available, and thereafter one may go to a harbour pub and listen to people singing about being out at sea. The usual song is Spanish Ladies, although you will hear The Mingulay Boat Song in places like Stornaway or Ullapool. You do not need to know the words of these songs to sing them to some effect.The happiest day of your le is the day you buy your boat. An even happier day is the day you sell it. The bit in between can be full of joy, too, in its special way. Read Patrick O’Brian and find all about it.

But any prospect of the UK government repeating the granting of a Section  order, which would allow Scottish ministers to hold a legally binding vote, was ruled out by Mr Lidington.“We don’t see any evidence that there is a demand from the people of Scotland to review the decision they took in ,” he said. “That referendum was said at the time to settle matters for a generation.“We don’t see that a Section  order is called for. I don’t see how it would help put right problems with Scottish schools and hospitals.“Devolution in Scotland has given many additional powers to the Scottish Parliament and some of those powers have not even be used. So I think there is plenty more that can be done in terms of the Scottish Government using the powers that are already there.”Askedhe would rule out granting a Section  order before , the minister said: “We have made it very clear we don’t think that is justied.”The First Minister indicated the Scottish Government would hold off requesting a Section  order. While Mrs May’s administration has ruled out granting one, the Prime Minister is widely expected to stand down in the coming monthsa Brexit deal can be secured. Mr Lidington refused to speculate on whether a new Tory government would be more likely to grant the order. The minister’s remarks were seized on by the SNP, with the party’s Westminster leader describing them as an “arrogant diktat”.Ian Blackford said: “Scotland’s future cannot and will not be decided by the arrogant diktat of this shambles of a Tory government, which has been rejected by Scottish voters at every election and which is soon likely to be out of office.“Whatever people’s views on independence, a strong majority of people back the Scottish Parliament’s right to determine the nation’s future.“Overwhelmingly, it is Holyrood – not Westminster – which the people of Scotland believe should have the right to decide this country’s democratic path.“The Westminster system is broken beyond repair and does not serve Scotland’s interests – something now conceded at senior levels in the Scottish Tory ranks.” But the Scottish Conservatives said the new polling proved there was no demand for another referendum.The Survation poll found more people were in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK than leaving. Askeda referendum was held on the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”,  per cent said they would vote remain and  per cent said they would vote leave.More respondentssaid leaving the UK would be worse for Scotland’s economy than Brexit, while  per cent thought it would be better.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example. Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead. I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner # lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"yfc get on their bike with 75km for 75 years","story":"Rathfriland Young Farmers Club are set to kick off their th anniversary celebrations with a bang this weekend.The club are delighted to announce their first event to commemorate the milestone anniversary with a sponsored cycle challenge.

They’ve been to an All-Ireland semi-final and they know when to stop the game and they have a few marquee players. I thought our boys matched them. We were under the cosh at times, but our boys showed desire and pride too. The conditions were dficult and we saw some of the shots and passes out there – the game was probably lucky to be played, but the surface was fine.”The teams were closely matched for the first  minutes with Antrim’s Paudie McLaughlin cancelling out an early Liam McDonald free for Monaghan.However, the hosts were dealt a blow when full-back Emmett Irvine, who had impressed in the early stages, picked up a black card after  minutes and the Farneymen assumed control for the remainder of the half with scores from Jason Irwin, Darragh Dempseyand McDonaldputting them - to - ahead at the break.Antrim’s second and final point arrived via a well-taken effort from Daniel McNicholl while Irwin landed his second of the evening on  minutes.Yet, the Monaghan captain, booked in the first half, picked up a second yellow for a high tackle moments later and the visitors were guilty of some cynical fouling as they looked to preserve their lead.Another Dempsey free moved them four clear inside the final  minutes and they looked to have done enough to seal victory.Antrim’s Ryan Lennon was black-carded for a third-man tackle, but a clever pass across the face of goal in stoppage time from Reuben Carleton allowed McNally to palm the ball past Joe Kirk in the Monaghan goal.Monaghan corner-forward McDonald was issued with a straight red for a strike while Antrim didn’t have time to muster a late equaliser.McAllister’s men must quickly regroup for the Qualiers as they will face Armagh in the Athletic Grounds on Saturday afternoon.ANTRIM: J Rodgers R Carleton, E Irvine, M Ferris R Hagan, E Higgins, S O’Callaghan J McNally -, D McNicholl - R McKillop, S Madden, C Higgins P McLaughlin -, R Lennon, R Boyle.Subs: C Killough for Irvine , M Lynch for Higgins .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph digital named uks best regional news site","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In the late s then leader Mr Paisley led a Save Ulster from Sodomy campaign in an attempt to prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland.Mr Wells has attracted criticism for his comments in the past, most recently banning two DUP colleagues from his social media for voting in favour of LGBT issues.The former Health Minister alleged that Ms Bennington had been selected to run by party officers over more qualied local candidates. data-dfpadtargetingJim WellsRead MoreDUP fields first openly gay council candidateWells bars DUP pair from his social media sites over LGBT voteJim Wells expresses grave concern over introduction of HIV preventative drug in Northern Ireland\"Nobody in the party beyond headquarters staff were aware of this,\" the South Down MLA said.\"I have had calls from every corner of Northern Ireland and further afield, from Londonderry, Kilkeel, Ballymena, Tyrone, all absolutely shocked on so many levels.\"\"There was absolutely no consultation with anybody at any level.

In recent days Mr Adams has been campaigning alongside party colleagues in Belfast and Newry. Sinn Fein has said it will not re-enter a power-sharing government with the DUP until an Irish Language Act is agreed, as well as the legalisation of same-sex marriage.But North Belfast MP Mr Dodds suggested voters had other concerns. He said: \"Sinn Fein is under pressure and on the back foot as people on the doorsteps demand the restoration of the NI Assembly so decisions about roads, schools and hospitals can be made. \"The DUP has put forward a reasonable proposal to immediately restore the Assembly but in parallel with a talks process to deal with Sinn Fein demands such as the Irish language. \"Most political leaders agree with the DUP.

He promised to abide by the constitution that stripped emperors of political power, and to fulfil his responsibility as a national symbol while “always turning my thoughts to the people and standing with them”.“I sincerely pray for the happiness of the people and the further development of the nation as well as the peace of the world,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  People gather in the compound near Imperial Palace in Tokyo Naruhito is considered a new breed of royal, his outlook forged by the tradition-defying choices of his parents. Emperor Emeritus Akihito devoted his three-decade career to making amends for a war fought in his father’s name while bringing the aloof monarchy closer to the people.Naruhito’s mother, Michiko, was born a commoner and was Catholic educated. Together, they reached out to the people, especially those who faced disability, discrimination and natural disasters.Naruhito was presented with the imperial sword and jewel, each in a box and wrapped in cloth, at a morning ceremony that marked his first official duty.His we and daughter, Empress Masako and -year-old Princess Aiko, were barred from the ceremony, which only adult male royals, his brother, now Crown Prince Fumihito, and his uncle Prince Hitachi, were allowed to witness. Their guests included a female Cabinet minister, however, as the Imperial House Law has no provision on the gender of commoners in attendance.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Japan’s new Emperor Naruhito with Empress Masako The banning of female royals at the ceremony underscored the uncertain future of a paternalistic imperial family that now has just two heirs.Nevertheless, Japan festively celebrated an imperial succession prompted by retirement rather than death. Many people stood outside the palace Tuesday to reminisce about Akihito’s era others joined midnight events when the transition occurred, and more came to celebrate the beginning of Naruhito’s reign.Dozens of couples lined up at government offices to submit marriage documents to mark the first day of Naruhito’s era, known as Reiwa, or “beautul harmony”.Today marks the beginning of the Japans new era, Reiwa   beautul harmony. People are celebrating the Accession to the Throne and, on May, the General Public will visit the Imperial Palace for celebration: https:t.co xnHDRZbIg pic vPYiQUq— japanMay , Natsumi Nishimura, a -year-old saleswoman, and Keigo Mori, a -year-old government worker, were at a Tokyo office on Wednesday, saying they decided to tie the knot at the start of a new era to mark their new le together.“Opportunities like this don’t come by often so we thought it would be a day we won’t forget,” Ms Nishimura said.Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe congratulated Naruhito on his ascension, pledging to create a “bright future” during the new era that is peaceful and full of hope.Naruhito also received congratulations from abroad. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Cars with Japanese flags pass on the double bridge to enter the Imperial Palace President Donald Trump’s message said America and Japan will renew the bonds of friendship in the new era.Chinese President Xi Jinping was quoted by state media as saying China and Japan should work together to promote peace and development and bilateral ties.From a car window on his way to and from the palace, Naruhito smiled and waved at people cheering on the sidewalk. He and his family will continue living at his Togu Palace until they switch places with his parents after refurbishments.Naruhito, , is the nation’s th emperor, according to a palace count that historians say likely included mythical figures until around the th century.The emperor under Japan’s Constitution is a symbol without political power. Wartime militarist governments worshipped the emperor as a living god until Naruhito’s grandfather renounced that status after the country’s  war defeat.Akihito during his three-decade reign embraced an identity as peacemaker and often made reconciliatory missions and carefully scripted expressions of regret on the war. His immersion in that role leaves Naruhito largely free of the burden of the wartime legacy, allowing him to carve his own path.Palace watchers say he might focus on global issues, including disaster prevention, water conservation and climate change, which could appeal to younger Japanese, while also emulating his father’s focus on peace.That is what many Japanese hope Naruhito will pursue.“I hope the new emperor will be like the Heisei emperor , who cherishes peace,” said Takayori Kobayakawa, a -year-old retired person from Shizuoka, central Japan. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The motorcade of Japan’s new Emperor Naruhito, second from right, leaves the Imperial Palace “I have high hopes for him.”Naruhito also faces uncertainties in the imperial household. Crown Prince Fumihito, , and Fumihito’s -year-old son, Prince Hisahito, can currently succeed him. The Imperial House Law confines the succession to male heirs, leaving Naruhito’s daughter out of the running.Naruhito’s we, Empress Masako, is a Hard-educated former diplomat who may prove an adept partner in his overseas travels and activities. But much will depend on her health, since she has been recovering from what the palace describes as stress-induced depression for about  years. He recently said he hopes Masako might slowly expand her role.Masako has largely limited her public appearances since late , after giving birth to their daughter and facing pressure to produce a son. Naruhito criticised palace officials in , though subtly, for denying Masako’s personality and career and pushing her into a corner."},{"url":null,"title":"thailands king makes his consort his queen ahead of coronation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Well before the first Chinese arrived in June , British trade unionists were alarmed that a precedent was being set for the importation of cheap labour closer to home, and Britain’s ‘Non-conformist conscience’ was disturbed at the spectre of ‘nameless practices’ developing in compounds of young men separated from their families. ‘Chinese slavery’ would be a major factor in the crushing defeat of the Conservatives in the  general election.\"In Belfast, William Walker, Ireland’s best known Labour leader before Big Jim Larkin, made much of ‘Chinese slavery’ in his efforts to become a Labour MP in Belfast North. Hoping to present himself as a patriotic imperialist and build an alliance with the Belfast Protestant Association, Walker raised the issue on Belfast trades council and in the Irish Trades Union Congress, the labour press, and his election campaigns.\"The Irish reaction reveals trade union attitudes towards the empire, South Africa, and race. It also illustrates similarities and dferences between Irish and British labour activists, and between labour leaders in nationalist Dublin and in Unionist Belfast.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

As he sat on top of the mountain with no name, counting all the athletes as they reached the summit and the yellow sun began to set over the rolling green hills, he thought to himself that this was truly a place of beauty to be shared with like-minded people. There was ldquono better place to be on a Thursday evening.This yearrsquos race began at the stone monument. The athletes run along the Shimna River almost as quickly as the salmon heading to spawn. After reaching the lowest part of Tollymore, they run to the very highest point of the park at Carrigard via the affectionately known lsquochutersquo.From here, they cross a stile onto open mountain leading to the hill with no name, a sharp climb and itrsquos all downhill from there to the finish mdash well, almost. So far, this yearrsquos race directors have added and subtracted new paths, just to spice things up. They certainly had a little chilli powder before crossing the finish line.It would be remiss at this stage not to mention the legend that is Deon McNeilly, AKA lsquothe big fellarsquo.Deon has won more races than most people have had hot dinners, so, it was a surprise to see him in nd place in last weekrsquos race. A quick Google diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma, a new inhaler later and suddenly this week he was th.He claimed he had more Salbutamol than a famous Tour de France winner. Seamus Lynch better watch out as Deon has suggested that he is taking a double dose next week. It is ironic that this is called The Monument race. The race takes its name from the stone obelisk built by Robert Jocelyn, in honour of his son James, who suffered from asthma in the days long before Google. Second and third places went to Mourne runners, Timothy Johnston and Jonathan Scott respectively. Jared Martin, in fth place, was the first junior to pass the finish line. As well as the senior event, Phil Hodge organised a junior run as a selection race for an international event.These young ones are aged  to  and it was incredible that Tom Crudingtonof Newcastle AC, on a slightly shortened course, managed to cross the line even ahead of Seamus Lynch.Ciara Savage, of Newcastle AC, was the first female junior. A massive congratulations to all of the juniors who entered and hopefully we can encourage even more for the next junior race at Binnian.The ladiesrsquo event followed a similar vein with last weekrsquos winner Esther Dickson, of Newry AC in dominate form.Second place was Karen Wilton and Sarah Graham romped home in third. Poor Sarah, however, was cornered by McNeilly in the Avoca at the presentation, who was heard regaling her of his past triumphs, including his  minute k and  minute  miler.Perhaps there was some consolation for Sarah in that she wasnrsquot subjected to Joe McCann recounting his illustrious Armagh . If ever there was an incentive for rival clubs to challenge Newcastle AC, surely it must be to prevent future clean sweeps by the host club, who won the male open, the - Junior male and female, the vet , vet , vet , vet , vet  and vet .Getting into the great outdoors often inspires spiritual re-awakening, especially on Holy Thursday.

Main buildings around the world were turned green to mark this day.ldquoAnd, as the Good Friday Agreement comes under pressure, St Patrick speaks to a shared heritage across this island. And he should be a force for reconciliation right now.Mr Coveney added: ldquoThere should never be ision in this island and we should share the richness of his story. St Patrick is a treasure to us all.ldquoA treasure to those of faith and to those with no faith at all. He challenged this island and found courage, redemption and transformation.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, discussed the grave of St Patrick with Mr Coveney and other clergy and politicians.Dean Hull added: ldquoSt Patrick probably died in his church at Saul and was driven by a cart and four oxen, which settled on the hill in Downpatrick, where he was buried. As was the custom, Patrickrsquos remains were subject to becoming reliquaries and part of his jaw bone is in the Down County Museum today..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traders fume at roadworks delay  ","story":"WORK on a major public realm scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned, sparking a furious reaction from traders.Work on the near pound, scheme was due to complete at the end of March but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced. It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening. If the work can be completed ahead of schedule this would be welcomed, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Work set to resume at old Downe  ","story":"BUILDING work on a new social housing project at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick is due to resume in the near future.Contractors moved off site a few weeks ago after laying foundations for a number of new homes whichare being built on behalf of Clanmill Housing.An initial  homes are being built part as part of a major social housing project at the site where around  new homes could eventually be constructed.While concern has recently been expressed locally about the halt to construction work at the site,Clanmill has explained that there is a valid reason.The social housing provider said it is aware that work at the sprawling town centre site mdash which borders four main roads mdash has ceased for a short period of time.ldquoThe developerrsquos subcontractor is awaiting the arrival on site of a piling rig to allow work to continue, she explained.ldquoWe appreciate the continued support and patience of local residents as construction continues and are looking forward to welcoming families to the first phase of the development later in the year as planned.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.Itrsquos understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, is pleased that the suspension to building work is only temporary.ldquoThe redevelopment of the former hospital site will go some way to reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick, he said.ldquoThe Clanmill project is an eagerly awaited development. Not only will it provide much-needed new homes, but greatly assist with the social and economic regeneration of this particular part of the town. People are eager to see the first tenants move into their new homes and the transformation of this particular site.Cllr Curran said he is also pleased that tenants could be in their new homes later in the year.ldquoWe have a number of people on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category. They will no doubt be eagerly monitoring the progress of building work at the old Downe complex, he continued.Cllr Curran added: ldquoHaving viewed plans for the redevelopment of the entire site, I can say that they are particularly impressive and will transform what had become a blot on the landscape into a vibrant, and much-needed social housing development..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17569313.impartial-explorer-world-wide-religious-movement-started-locally/resources/images/9559549.jpg","title":"life without art would be empty and unsatisfying","story":"JC: What is your artistic background JC: What inspires your art JC: Is there a specic place that you do your work JC: What has been your most ambitious piece to date JC: What dferent artistic media do you use and which is your favourite JC: What are you currently working on JC: Do you exhibit your work anywhere JC: Any new artistic ventures planned for  JC: What are you up to when you arenrsquot painting JC: What does your art mean to you This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

eight, episode three of Game of Thrones. Directed by Miguel Sapochnik – who also helmed fan-favourite episodes including ‘Hardhome’ and ‘Battle of the Bastards’ – last night’s instalment ‘The Long Night’ was billed as one of the longest and largest battle scenes ever committed to film or TV.And while the episode was filled with explosive and grisly scenes of warfare, some have been complaining that they were straining to see the battle, due to the episode’s apparently darker-than-usual cinematography.One Twitter user wrote: “Tried to watch Game Of Thrones tonight but the episode was too dark to see anything. It sounded very exciting though!”Another said: “I’ve been watching ep for  minutes, still don’t know what’s going on it’s too dark.”Some have suggested that people could have solved the issue by adjusting the settings on their TV’s, with one person stating: “Did people forget they can increase the brightness and contrast on their TVs ”Another claimed it may have been due to the limitations of streaming services: “One of the reasons for the ‘it’s too dark’ complaints about the new Game of Thrones is because so many will be streaming it. Many streaming services are still poor when it comes to video encoding for dark scenes.”However, plenty of viewers seemed to have no problem and were left wondering what all the fuss was about“Turn your light off, close your blinds and stop whining,” one Twitter user wrote.Another said: “I saw what I needed to see. Arya kicked butt. And the red woman came back and helped. Theon protected Bran till the end. Jorah protected Dany.”“I guess its winterfell’s fault for not having proper street lighting,” joked another.Man dies after being hit by two vehicles in Hampshire town Cranleigh School opens new

He said that there were areas which “unionism has in the past only touched on a superficial basis, perhaps because of perceptions that it was not worth it given the lack of potential votes”.Mr Dougan accepted that abortion was not primarily an issue for local government but said that it was a topic on which he felt passionately and “I believe these big issues are important” and councillors had a role in lobbying beyond their council work. However, he said that  posters were removed in what he believed was “an organised exercise”.Mr Ó Coigligh said: “I have found huge support for the DUP stance on abortion in nationalist republican areas ... people as erse as a former GAA county captain and a former member of the UDA who served a sentence in Long Kesh in the early s said that cross-community support for the DUP was the way forward and that they admired my modest efforts in this regard.”Mr Dougan said that he had respect for the Irish languaage – and Mr Ó Coigligh translated one of his booklets on Orangeism into Irish – but did not support an Irish language act.DUP-Free Presbyterian tension as party’s gay candidate choice moves it further from church roots Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Nerves of steel, calmness and sanity. Long live the workers and of the country!On Tuesday the oppositionrsquos hoped-for split in the military did not emerge, a plane that the United States claimed was standing by to ferry Mr Maduro into exile never took off and by nightfall one of the governmentrsquos bravest opponents, who defied house arrest to join the insurrection, had quietly sought refuge with his family in a foreign embassy.Mr Guaido, the telegenic -year-old leader of the opposition-dominated congress who is recognised by the US and over  nations as Venezuelarsquos rightful president, nonetheless pressed forward in calling for a new round of mass street protests. Opposition forces are hoping that Venezuelans angered by broadcast images of armoured vehicles ploughing into protesters and fed up with their nationrsquos dire humanitarian crisis will fill streets across the nation.In one blow to Mr Maduro, the head of Venezuelarsquos feared intelligence agency announced that he was breaking ranks with the embattled socialist leader. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Men look to recover usable parts from motorcycles burned during the previous dayrsquos clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in Caracas, Venezuela  --ldquoWe need to keep up the pressure, Mr Guaido said. ldquoWe will be in the streets.The latest chapter in Venezuelarsquos political upheaval marks the most serious threat yet to Mr Madurorsquos contested rule. The leader, who has been relying on support from Russia and China, was largely absent as events unfolded on Tuesday. He finally emerged late in the evening to call the small-scale uprising a failed US-backed coup attempt.Speaking on state television, Mr Maduro said that the unrest had been quelled and that Venezuela would not succumb to right-wing forces intent on ldquosubmitting our country to a neocolonial economic domination model and enslaving Venezuela.ldquoNow you can see a Venezuela largely in peace, he proclaimed.Venezuelans waited to seethat remained the case. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A Boliian National Guard vehicle sprays opponents of Venezuelarsquos President Nicolas Maduro  --The competing quests to solidy a hold on power produced one of the most stunning days yet for a country with the worldrsquos largest proven oil reserves but is struggling with an economic contraction that is worse than the US Great Depression.The turmoil on Tuesday began when Mr Guaido, flanked by a few dozen national guardsmen and some armoured crowd-control vehicles, released a three-minute video shot near the Carlota air base.In a surprise, Leopoldo Lopez, Mr Guaidorsquos political mentor and the nationrsquos most-prominent opposition activist, stood alongside him. Detained in  for leading a previous round of anti-government unrest, Mr Lopez said he had been released from house arrest by security forces following an order from Mr Guaido. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A supporter of Venezuelarsquos President Nicolas Maduro --ldquoI want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers, Mr Lopez declared.As the two opposition leaders coordinated actions from a motorway overpass, troops loyal to Mr Maduro fired tear gas from inside the adjacent air base.A crowd that quickly swelled to a few thousand scurried for cover, reappearing later with Mr Guaido at a plaza a few blocks away. A smaller group of masked youths stayed behind on the road, lobbing rocks and petrol bombs toward the air base and setting a government bus on fire.ldquoItrsquos now or never, said one of the young rebellious soldiers, his face covered in the blue bandanna worn by the few dozen insurgent soldiers. -- vw,vw,px, px\"An opponent of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro  --Amid the mayhem, several armoured utility vehicles drove at full speed into the crowd. Two demonstrators, lying on the ground with their heads and legs bloodied, were rushed away on a motorcycle as the armoured vehicles sped away dodging petrol bombs thrown by the demonstrators.The head of a medical centre near the site of the street battles said doctors were treating over  people, about half of them with injuries suffered from rubber bullets. At least one person had been shot with live ammunition. The Venezuelan human rights group Provea said a -year-old man was fatally shot during an anti-government protest in the city of La Victoria.#EnVivo # | Mensaje al pueblo venezolano y al mundo, ante la nueva arremetida contra la Paz de la Patria. https:t.co hSrnPQjmmdash Nicolaacutes MaduroMay , Later Tuesday, Mr Lopez and his family sought refuge in the Chilean ambassadorrsquos residence and later moved to the Spanish Embassy. There were also reports that  soldiers who had been with Mr Guaido fled to Brazilrsquos diplomatic mission.Amid the unrest, Mr Madurorsquos military commanders went on state television to proclaim their loyalty. Flanked by top generals, defence minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez condemned Mr Guaidorsquos move as a ldquoterrorist act and ldquocoup attempt that was bound to fail like past uprisings.ldquoThose who try to take Miraflores with violence will be met with violence, he said, referring to the presidential palace where hundreds of government supporters, some of them brandishing firearms, gathered in response to a call to defend Mr Maduro.But in a possible sign that Mr Madurorsquos inner circle could be fracturing, the head of Venezuelarsquos secret police wrote a letter breaking ranks with the embattled leader.In a letter directed to the Venezuelan people, Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, the head of Venezuelarsquos feared SEBIN intelligence agency, said he had always been loyal to Mr Maduro but now it is time to ldquorebuild the country. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Francisco Fajardo road sits empty the day after clashes occurred  --He said corruption has become so rampant that ldquomany high-ranking public servants practise it like a sport.ldquoThe hour has arrived for us to look for other ways of doing politics, Mr Figuera wrote.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed Mr Maduro had an airplane ldquoon the tarmac Tuesday morning and was ready to flee but was dissuaded by ldquoRussians.Mr Maduro ridiculed that idea in his TV speech, adding: ldquoMr Pompeo, what lack of seriousness.Most shops and businesses were closed and the streets of the capital unusually quiet as people huddled at home to await the outcome of the drama.Mr Guaido said he called for the uprising to restore a constitutional order broken when Mr Maduro was sworn in earlier this year for a second term following a presidential election boycotted by the opposition and considered illegitimate by dozens of countries.As events unfolded, governments around the world expressed support for Mr Guaido while reiterating calls to avoid violent confrontation.The majority of Venezuelans and the leading democracies in the region have called for the exit of foreign security and intelligence forces from Venezuela and reiterated the rejection of Madurorsquos usurpation of power.mdash John BoltonMay , US national security adviser John Bolton said the Trump administration was waiting for three key officials, including Mr Madurorsquos defence minister and head of the supreme court, to act on what he said were private pledges to remove Mr Maduro. ldquoAll agreed that Maduro had to go, Mr Bolton said.Thus far, Mr Maduro has refrained from detaining Mr Guaido, but the president said Tuesday night that Venezuelarsquos chief prosecutor was assigning three deputies to investigate the uprising and promised there ldquowill be criminal charges.ldquoWhat do they want, a military battle  Mr Maduro asked, seated beside the Venezuelan flag. ldquoDoes that benefit Venezuela, democracy, peace .push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Defiant Venezuela president ridicules opposition attempts to oust him article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mrs May told the cross-party committee of senior backbenchers:ldquoWersquove been having constructive, meaningful talks which are continuing.ldquoThere are dferences on issues but on many of the key areas ndash particularly on the Withdrawal Agreement ndash there is common ground.ldquoWe know that we need to end this uncertainty and do it as soon as possible and I hope a deal can be done. We certainly approach this with an open mind.ldquoButwe are not able to do that, then we will bring votes to the House in order to determine what the House will support. We stand ready to abide by that decisionthe opposition are willing to do so.She added:ldquoThe choice before the House remains the choice thathas always been before the House in relation to this issue.ldquoWe can form a majority to raty and leave with a deal, we can decide to leave with no deal, we can go back to the people, admit failure and ask them to think again or we could revoke Brexit.ldquoThose are the choices. I thinkhellip the only acceptable one is to form a majority to raty the Withdrawal Agreement.Some Tory MPs and ministers remain deeply unhappy at the prospect of a deal with a left-wing Labour Party led by Mr Corbyn.Their concerns come amid fears the Conservatives face heavy losses in the local elections on Thursday as voters vent their fury at the Governmentrsquos failure to leave the EU, as promised, on March ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May hoping for Brexit deal in  uconstructive u talks with Labour article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"would you do a blind interview","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Diversity and inclusion in the workplace has never been more relevant than it is today, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays Northern IrelandIn a recent global survey by Hays for International Women’s Day, we asked over , respondents on a scale of one to five how committed their employer was to achieving gender equality. Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/DEB.jpg","title":"debenhams pushes on with cva and store closures","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Debenhams has launched its cost-saving plans as it reveals it will push forward with the closure of  of its stores next year, it has emerged. The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive. With margins so tight, that tax burden is making le dficult for high street retailers.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Email-640x315.jpg","title":"it firm pinnacle hosting event at kingspan stadium","story":"Posted on Tuesday  April  by Ulster Business A leading IT firm will host an event at the home of Ulster Rugby at an event to help educate and inform businesses.
