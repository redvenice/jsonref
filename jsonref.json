It also argues that it will make it hard for BBC Studios to compete with its commercial rivals.But the MPs said there is ‘no shortage’ of companies eager to work with the BBC.The Government previously agreed that the BBC would not have to reveal figures for stars paid through third-party companies when they thrashed out the current BBC Charter.At the time, the BBC argued that disclosing the salary details of its biggest names would make it too easy for rivals to poach them.          At the moment, its annual ‘rich list’ of highest-paid earners only includes those it pays directly – meaning the stars of hit shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Casualty can all keep their pay deals secretBut the landscape changed dramatically in 2017, when the first round of disclosures exposed the BBC’s yawning gender pay gap.Now, critics fear that the loophole allows the BBC to hide huge payments to stars that would never win public backing.They also claim that the BBC will be able to pick and choose which payments to disclose in order to manipulate the number of men versus women appearing on the list of highest-paid earners.The BBC has already said that it will include Fiona Bruce’s pay package for Question Time in the next round of disclosures, although the show is made by an independent firm. By doing so, the BBC will be able to boast that it has improved the number of women among its top 20 earners.In the report published today, MPs also savaged the corporation’s ‘failure’ to get to grips with the gender pay problem.The group warned it will keep summoning bosses back to the select committee to see what they are doing to fix it, but said it ‘should not take a select committee inquiry for action to be precipitated’.In their scathing report, MPs called on the BBC to set a deadline for resolving the ongoing equal pay claims by staff, and give workers access to more information about how much their colleagues earn.They said the broadcaster should drill down into its official ‘pay bands’ and publish details of the male-female split for each quartile within each band, ‘so women can compare their salaries’ to their male colleagues doing equal work. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/22/16/4445028C00000578-6619953-image-a-11_1548173538764.jpg","title":"P O declares ships sail Cyprus flag Brexit","story":"    British ferry giant P\u0026ampO will re-register its ships under the Cyprus flag to avoid extra checks after Brexit (pictured, a P\u0026ampO ship)Angela Merkel sticks the boot in by branding Britain\u0027s...A snap election will make Corbyn PM, warns internal Tory...Share this article\u0027For operational and accounting reasons, we have concluded that the best course of action is to reflag all ships to be under the Cyprus flag.\u0027He said the Cyprus flag is on the \u0027white list\u0027 of both the Paris and Tokyo Memoranda of Understanding.This means it will result in fewer inspections and delays and \u0027significantly more favourable\u0027 tax arrangementsHe added: \u0027We have no plans to make any other changes, including the terms and conditions of any of our seafarers, as a result of the new arrangements.\u0027          The company, best known for its vacuum cleaners and other domestic appliances, is working on developing an electric vehicle in the Asian nationThe company had already re-registered two of its ships to Cyprus last month The RMT trade union has previously described P\u0026ampO\u0027s reflagging of UK ships as \u0027pure opportunism\u0027.The union claims the firm\u0027s \u0027long-term aim has always been to switch the UK fleet to a tax haven register\u0027. P\u0026ampO has six UK-registered ships operating on the busy English Channel route to France.All commercial ships have to be registered, or flagged, with a country partly to comply with safety and environmental regulations.It could be a blow to the Government\u0027s attempts to buy up ship space to ensure vital goods - like drugs and medical equipment - can get to Britain if there is a no deal Brexit. The announcmenet came just hours after Dyson decalred that it is moving its headquarters to Singapore.The vacuum cleaner firm insisted the decision has nothing to do with Brexit or trying to take advantage of lower taxes. Instead they said that the electronics firm wants to be nearer the expanding Asian markets. But the decision was blasted by campaigners and MPs, who accused Sir James of \u0027staggering hypocrisy\u0027. Sir James was one of the loudest business supporters of Brexit at the 2016 referendum and when the talks stagnated in 2017 he urged Theresa May to \u0027walk away\u0027 and embrace leaving Europe. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran blasted the move, saying: \u0027James Dyson can say whatever he wants but he is ditching Britain. \u0027This can only be seen is a vote of no confidence in the idea of Brexit Britain.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"After IS Trinidad boys leave Syria Pink Floyd help","story":"A member of an NGO accompanies two Caribbean children and their mother as they prepare to leave the northeastern Syrian Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli on January 21, 2018ISIS overran large parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq that year, declaring a \u0027caliphate\u0027 and attracting thousands of foreign jihadists.It has since lost most of that territory to various offensives, including to one led by Kurdish fighters and backed by the US-led coalition.\u0027The two children were freed from the Raqa area several months ago,\u0027 said Fener al-Qait, a foreign affairs official with Syria\u0027s semi-autonomous Kurdish authorities.An IS fighter, \u0027the father was married to another woman.

It also argues that it will make it hard for BBC Studios to compete with its commercial rivals.But the MPs said there is ‘no shortage’ of companies eager to work with the BBC.The Government previously agreed that the BBC would not have to reveal figures for stars paid through third-party companies when they thrashed out the current BBC Charter.At the time, the BBC argued that disclosing the salary details of its biggest names would make it too easy for rivals to poach them.          At the moment, its annual ‘rich list’ of highest-paid earners only includes those it pays directly – meaning the stars of hit shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Casualty can all keep their pay deals secretBut the landscape changed dramatically in 2017, when the first round of disclosures exposed the BBC’s yawning gender pay gap.Now, critics fear that the loophole allows the BBC to hide huge payments to stars that would never win public backing.They also claim that the BBC will be able to pick and choose which payments to disclose in order to manipulate the number of men versus women appearing on the list of highest-paid earners.The BBC has already said that it will include Fiona Bruce’s pay package for Question Time in the next round of disclosures, although the show is made by an independent firm. By doing so, the BBC will be able to boast that it has improved the number of women among its top 20 earners.In the report published today, MPs also savaged the corporation’s ‘failure’ to get to grips with the gender pay problem.The group warned it will keep summoning bosses back to the select committee to see what they are doing to fix it, but said it ‘should not take a select committee inquiry for action to be precipitated’.In their scathing report, MPs called on the BBC to set a deadline for resolving the ongoing equal pay claims by staff, and give workers access to more information about how much their colleagues earn.They said the broadcaster should drill down into its official ‘pay bands’ and publish details of the male-female split for each quartile within each band, ‘so women can compare their salaries’ to their male colleagues doing equal work. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/02/07/51E5F63400000578-0-image-a-2_1541145076241.jpg","title":"oung womans tyre blows middle outback 40C heat leaving stranded","story":"    Emma Collishaw (pictured left) said a very generous truck driver, Jason Freyling, (pictured right) helped her in her hour of needAfter trying and failing to change the tyre herself, of which Ms Collishaw admits it took her \u0027half an hour just to get the hub cap off\u0027, she decided to try and flag down a passer-by.And thankfully for Ms Collishaw, a very generous truck driver spotted her at the side of the rode and decided to  help.Schizophrenic killer \u0027thought he was saving the world\u0027 when...British parents desperate to avoid the \u00279-5 grind\u0027 now live...Share this articleTaking to her social media page to give her saviour \u0027recognition for all he had done\u0027, she explained how the man, Jason Freyling, went out of his way to help.She wrote: \u0027Not only did he help change my tyre whilst supplying me with cold drinks.

This photograph was taken by Gijsbert Hanekroot, the Netherlands\u0027 premier rock photographer at the time, who said that Bowie was his favourite musician to work with. On one occasion in 1971, Hankeroot told of how he bumped into Bowie in a canteen while he was working on lyrics for Ziggy Stardust and asked his opinion on one of the lines          Bob Dylan photographed at Madison Square Garden in New York, 1974. Hankeroot managed to inset himself in the midst of a heady time in both music and culture, living the rockstar lifestyle by proxy as he flew all over the world to photograph its biggest stars. \u0027We saw The Eagles in London, Paul McCartney in south of France, Bob Dylan in New York and the Stones in Hamburg. We visited London every two months. It was the most natural thing in the world,\u0027 he said          John Lennon and Yoko Ono photographed in Selfridges on Oxford Street in 1971. Hankeroot was best-known for working in low-light settings, such as concert halls and music venues, so this is one of his rarer daylight shots. He used darkroom techniques that lent a grainy texture to the pictures he took, which is particularly visible on the faces of his subjects          Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, smoke a cigarette somewhere in Belgium, 1976. Hankeroot was recognised for his talent in his own time, working for Dutch magazine Oort, but he left the field of music photography in the 80s and his work has gone ingored. But he is now opening a new show in Hong Kong to display a retrospective of his works          Lou Reed lights a cigarette in Amsterdam, 1972. Hankeroot liked to spend as much time as possible with his subjects, staying the full length of their set if they were playing, or \u0027until the subject was bored of me\u0027, if they were in a studio. \u0027That\u0027s the moment that he or she would stop acting or posing, those often became the best pictures,\u0027 he said  Neil Young slumps on a sofa in his hotel  in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1976 (left) while Patti Smith poses during a photo shoot in Amsterdam, exact date unknown (right). Hankeroot tried to embody the same spirit of reinvention and innovation that the musicians put into their songs in his photography, searching for new way to capture and define the seminal decade in art          Leonard Cohen, photographed on a cobbled street among pigeons, somewhere in Amsterdam in 1974.  Hankeroot was deeply embedded in the musical culture of the 1970s, by the time the following decade rolled around he decided to pursue \u0027other adventures\u0027, and now works mostly as a street photographer and documentary-maker          Frank Zappa photographed in Amsterdam in 1972. Though Hankeroot was born in Brussels, in neighbouring Belgium, he grew up in the Netherlands where he was given his first camera aged 13. At 16 he dropped out of school to pursue photography full-time and got an internship with Philip Mechanicus, where he learned to take portraits          Bryan Ferry at the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam, 1976. At the time, Ferry had just released Let\u0027s Stick Together, his first solo album since Roxy Music disbanded for the first time earlier the same year. He would release In Your Mind the following year and The Bride Stripped Bare the year after that before Roxy Music reformed          Photographers crowd around Mick Jagger, who is behind the camera in the shot, as they try to get a picture of him in Hamburg, Germany, in 1970          Hankeroot began digitising his archives years ago which led to the publication of Abba...

He declined and made his own arrangements.\u0027I can\u0027t tell you who arranged the flight because I don\u0027t know at this stage - but it certainly wasn\u0027t Cardiff City.\u0027He revealed that Cardiff\u0027s hard man manager Neil Warnock was \u0027in a state of shock\u0027 after hearing the news.                                                    The model was born in the Tres de Febrero area of the Argentine capital Buenos Aires and is believed to have been going out with the footballer for a few months last year. Reports in their home country suggest they may even have been engaged before they split up. Guernsey Police said today they are \u0027prioritising\u0027 the theory that the new £15million Cardiff City player and the pilot made it out of the wreckage found floating in the Channel last night.They are also working on three other possibilities - that the plane was grounded on dry land either in the Channel Islands or France, the pilot and Sala were picked up by a passing ship or they are dead in the water.It came as aviation experts claimed that the Piper Malibu plane that Sala was travelling in had a \u0027questionable\u0027 safety record with 55 fatal crashes including 24 since 2000.Former pilot Alastair Rosenschein said the plane may have become iced-up in the Arctic blast currently sweeping across northern Europe including the UK and France.He said: \u0027It\u0027s already a fairly risky crossing to do in a single engine aircraft, especially in winter and definitely at night. There are icing problems too. It\u0027s a strange thing to do though to go and fly over water with one engine at night in winter because if your engine goes you\u0027re going in the water\u0027. French media had reported pilot David Henderson, 60, was flying the missing Piper Malibu PA-46, which disappeared near the Channel Islands on Monday night.Mr Henderson later took to Facebook to confirm he was alive and well and it is unknown who was flying the missing PA-46.But in 2015, Mr Henderson appeared in a BBC video about his life as a transatlantic pilot and described the dangers of flying a Piper Malibu.In fact, Mr Henderson told how he would always wear a neoprene wetsuit and packed a life raft in the back to give him \u00276 or 7 or 8 hours survivability\u0027 in case he ditched into the Atlantic.He is filmed sitting in the cockpit of a plane - serial number N264DB - the same as that of the missing flight, according to reports on the Aviation Safety Network Wiki page.According to South Wales Aviation Group that same plane - a 1984 Piper serial number N264DB - took off from Rhoose, near Cardiff, on Saturday destined for Guernsey, presumed to be en route to France.Speaking to the BBC in 2015, Mr Henderson described the potential problems with the plane.\u0027One of the problems we can encounter is that ice can build up on the surfaces of the aircraft,\u0027 Mr Henderson explains.\u0027On the propeller and the wings and if it gets too great the aeroplane would ultimately stop flying.\u0027And the only way in most of the aeroplanes we fly to get rid of ice is to descend into warmer air and the ice will dissipate\u0027.

Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really’ This picture has actually lost me a few jobs. Plus I think I might even have lost a flat because of it. I was looking at a property and was chatting to the estate agent and told them that I’d recently shot David Cameron. We put an offer in – for the asking price – but it was turned down. So yes, I do suspect people don’t like David Cameron.But when you shoot someone like Cameron, though, you have to remain neutral. If you turn up thinking too many things then you’ll inevitably forget something, or position the lighting wrong, and the subject will get irritated. You have to go in with clarity. Whether you’re a former prime minister or a bus driver, I’ll always have the same clarity of thought.The photograph came about as part of a project I was working on, aiming to capture interesting faces in the style of artists such as Holbein and Caravaggio. It took place in Cameron’s office, almost exactly one year after his resignation. My degree is in medieval history, and so shooting people who are part of our history like this gives me an excuse to touch history.He arrived in his gym clothing, which was rather funny, and he was worried he looked a bit pasty. I explained my ideas, and about how I wanted to capture this sort of meditative statesman feeling. I wanted a sense of looking backwards at the current political situation.I was worried that Cameron might be a difficult person to photograph, but as a sitter he proved to be a darling. He had a lot of patience. You have to separate politics from the person, and he was a charming chap.I knew the public would be wondering, what is he thinking? That’s why I wanted him in this pose, shot in profile. There are no other pictures of Cameron like this – the others normally capture the signature “call me Dave” look. But now he’s not in power he can afford to show more emotion and try different poses.I do think the contemplation was genuine. I’ve worked with a lot of actors in Los Angeles so I know what faking it looks like. I’ve also worked with many politicians, both Conservative and Labour, and when I ask for a certain look, some of them can turn around instantly with that expression. But David seemed to me a genuine guy, a family man, who had a real sense of the seriousness of office. Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really.However, I never mentioned the B-word during the half hour we had for the sitting. I decided that wouldn’t have been a good idea. But he seemed very happy to talk about other things throughout his career. He told me that the most interesting place he’d visited was Libya after Gaddafi.I was inspired by Sir James Guthrie, the realist painter who depicted a lot of politicians straight after the first world war. They’d experienced all that horror and history, and he captured that moment. Backdrops are important for me. Guthrie painted in a muddy brown, suggestive of the trenches. I went with a fading blue backdrop. You can interpret that as the European flag fading away, or simply as the blue of Conservatism.I’m a realist photographer so I like to capture everything – the grey hairs, blotchy skin, all the details and lines. I want to say – this was the true image of David Cameron at this moment in history.He’s not the first leader I’ve photographed – I did John Major back in 2017 for another project. When I went to shoot him there was a sense of betrayal there. It was in his mouth, in his breath. But with David there was not that sense. He was energetic, almost raring to go. There was a restlessness I could really sense. I think he wants to return after this Brexit situation is resolved. I think he’ll be back.Born: Chester, 1982.Training: King’s College London.Influences: Caravaggio, Titian, Ribera, HolbeinHigh point: ‘Sir Patrick Stewart portrait sitting, New York.’Low point: ‘Not picking up a camera after I graduated.’Top tip: ‘Direction, direction, direction: break the ice with your subjects.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77cb463345d1dc9b82c7535b92d61bd31dc1127b/0_0_2349_2362/master/2349.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64cd7d5fea2150f205a7ec85a883aaf1 700w","title":"heatwave could topple adelaides 80 year old temperature record of 461c","story":"Bureau of meteorology forecasts a high of 45C in Adelaide with the heat to be worse this week than lastAdelaide’s 80-year-old heat record could topple this week, while in Tasmania emergency warnings were issued for six areas as almost 50 fires continued to burn across the state.On Thursday, the bureau of meteorology is forecasting a high of 45C in Adelaide, close to its 46.1C record.Severe weather warnings are also in place for extreme temperatures and high fire danger in Victoria and Tasmania on Friday, while in Western Australia a cyclone could develop off the north coast on Thursday.The BoM forecaster John Nairn said: “When we go to a number like that we have to be cognisant that there’s two records that we’ve got for Adelaide,” he said.“One on East Terrace (Kent Town) in 2009 where we got to 45.7 and the other on West Terrace in 1939 where we reached 46.1. Those numbers are not far from being reached on Thursday.”The Bom is forecasting temperatures into the 40sC for much of the state on Thursday, along with strong winds and severe fire danger.SA Health’s chief medical officer, Paddy Phillips, said the heatwave will be worse than last week’s, when some parts of the state recorded four days above 40C.“In last week’s heatwave we saw 69 people present to hospitals across the state with heat-related conditions and 31 of those were admitted,” he said.He urged the public to drink plenty of water, avoid exercise or physical activity, use air conditioners and fans and look after young children and frail relatives or neighbours.A cool change should reach Adelaide by Friday, when a high of 33C is forecast.Meanwhile in Tasmania, lives and properties remained at risk as weather conditions continued to worsen, authorities warned.The Tasmania Fire Service early on Wednesday morning warned residents of Miena, Barren Tier, Tods Corner, Penstock Lagoon, Liawenee and Shannon that they may be in danger and needed to take action immediately.A property had already been lost near Miena, the TFS confirmed on Tuesday night.Almost 50 fires were burning across the state and though conditions had eased, more winds and high temperatures were expected by the end of the week.Dean Narramore, a meteorologist with the Bom, said that for much of southeast Australia “Friday is the bad day”.“It’s going to be a hot night for much of southeast Australia on Thursday night,” he said.“Friday will be a very bad day for Tasmania and Victoria for both heat and fire danger.“We could see some very hot and windy conditions.”According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future.So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia?The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected.They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days.The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome\u0026nbsp may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.Temperatures into the 40sC will be widespread in Victoria, with northern parts of the state expected to reach the mid-40s and the low-40s in the south. Melbourne has a forecast of 41C on Friday.In Tasmania, residents in the line of fire were being told to be on alert for embers, smoke and ash and dozens of people had already moved to evacuation centres.A major fire was still burning near Gell River, northwest of Hobart, scorching more than 20,000 hectares of wilderness since it started on 28 December with another blaze near Lake Fergus in the state’s centre.The TFS deputy chief officer, Bruce Byatt, said fire crews would focus on a combination of containment and being ready to hit new fires fast.“It’s really about us setting triggers and when the triggers are reached, shifting our response from an offensive to a more defensive or ready to roll method of attack,” he said.Specialist fire personnel from interstate and New Zealand are helping tackle the scores of blazes.Meanwhile, in Western Australia there was a severe weather warning for damaging winds, abnormally high tides and damaging surf south of Perth on Wednesday.A cyclone track map was also in place for the north of the state off the Kimberley coast.“It’s a tropical low at the moment but we could see a cyclone develop sometime tomorrow off the Kimberley coast,” Narramore said.In the ACT, which last week broke its record for the number of days above 40C, temperatures in the high 30s are forecast again for the end of the week.In NSW, there will be temperatures in the mid to high 40sC at the end of the week, particularly on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5513cb50fa81501e0496c41f9d063dd95a7d1fd/355_99_3629_2177/master/3629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f84fb779351f24e5b6bb27f60cb48293","title":"all together now by mike carter review","story":"Following the route, decades later, of an anti-Thatcher march, a journalist asks what became of the country his father struggled to changeIt’s not up there with Peterloo, Jarrow or Orgreave, but the People’s March for Jobs in 1981 – when 300 men and women walked from Liverpool to London in protest against Margaret Thatcher’s government – was nonetheless a key moment in working-class history. Mike Carter should have been among the marchers. Though only 17 years old at the time, he’d already left school and experienced unemployment. More to the point, his dad Pete had asked him to come. And his dad – “one of the last of a breed of self-educated, working-class, chest-thumping orators” – was the march’s main organiser. There were good reasons for Carter’s absence and his life over the next three decades was too busy and peripatetic for regret. But after his father’s death, and the discovery among his possessions of a chipped commemorative mug from the march, he decided to make amends. In May 2016, he set out, alone, with a backpack, to walk the same route.The timing was propitious, just a few weeks before the European referendum: as well as re-examining his relationship with his father he wanted to take the nation’s pulse. How much had changed in 35 years? And had the values his father fought for survived? This book – an engaging blend of walking and talking – is his record of the journey he made over four weeks and 330 miles.With his Regency flat in Brighton and journalistic career in London, he wasn’t prepared for what he saw: the food banks, payday loan shops, bookies, pawnbrokers and sleeping bags in doorways. He wasn’t prepared for the soreness of his feet, either in solidarity with the original marchers, he had done no training. But there were half-days and rest days, and plenty of people to talk to – a few by prior arrangement – along the way.One of the first of them was Kim. At the time of the march, she’d been an unemployed single parent. The organisers initially blocked her from taking part, saying it would be too hard on her three-year-old. She argued back: they were marching for a better future, and wasn’t a child a symbol of the future? A week later, she joined in, wheeling her offspring ahead of her. Within a few days, embraced as a poster girl, she was given a brand-new pram.Most of those Carter meets have fond memories of the march: of the spirit of togetherness it engendered, the warm reception it received in the north and Midlands (less so south of Rugby), and the end-of-march party in Brockwell Park, south London, where the lineup of musicians included Pete Townshend and George Melly. One group, a punk band from Birmingham called the Quads, marched the whole route. Their song “Gotta Get a Job” caught the mood of the time before they slid from view. When Carter speaks on the phone to their lead singer, Josh Jones, he discovers he’s now a priest in New Zealand.The book includes a lot of conversations, not just those Carter has with others but those he has with himself, and us, as he analyses what he is seeing and expounds his ideas. As for the walking, he is increasingly keen on what he calls “desire paths” – shortcuts or long ways round, so as to avoid official paths or roads with heavy traffic. Desire paths are about people going where they please, regardless of others – as his father had done, when he walked out to start a new life, with a new family (affluent and middle-class), four years before the march.That’s why Mike didn’t join it. He couldn’t forgive Pete, even less so when his mum died of cancer soon afterwards, as if killed by grief. Over the years, there were attempts at reconciliation. But his dad always pushed him away. By the end Pete was living alone, on a canal barge, an alcoholic, suffering from lung cancer and virtually destitute, but still bull-headed, so much so that Carter lost it with him, reeling off the grievances he’d long held back. “But Mick,” Pete said, “It was all about the struggle. I sacrificed everything for the struggle.” “Look around you,” Carter screamed back, “It’s all fucked. All that struggle. Your life’s work. For what? Was it worth it?”That was the last exchange they had and it weighs heavily on Carter’s mind as he walks. Guilt, hatred, the need to prove himself and a recognition of common ground (like father, like son) – they’re all in the mix. Rather than berate his dad for wasting his life, he’s angry on his behalf at what England has become. Almost everyone he talks to is a Brexiter, even young people, immigrants and those from cities that have benefited from EU funding. They should be blaming Westminster, not Brussels, but he understands their demoralisation. Flats and houses are being snapped up by buy-to-rent landlords, pricing out the locals. Public spaces are being privatised and state assets sold off. Local authorities are having their budgets slashed, leaving charities and churches to fill the gaps. Above all, now that little is being manufactured, the sense of community that once nourished cities such as Stoke-on-Trent has been lost.It’s a depressing picture, backed up by extensive reading and research. But the rhythm of walking is therapeutic and Carter is cheered when people call him “love” or “duck” or “bab”. At the end, when he enters Trafalgar Square and removes his shoes and socks, there’s no triumphalism. But he is tentatively hopeful that the blight of neoliberalism will pass. No less important, he has made a fragile peace with his dad.• All Together Now? is published by  Faber (RRP £14.99). To order a copy for £9.99 go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

In one extreme case, an Africa-based thinktank questioned whether the link between cancer and smoking “was yet to be empirically established”, before backing away from the claim.Patricio Marquez, lead specialist on health global practice at the World Bank, said such activity could impact public health efforts. The thinktanks “have created an arsenal of evidence in order to influence policy-making and decision-making”, he said.In this network more than a fifth either argued against controls in some way, took industry donations, or both. Additionally:At least 53 free-market thinktanks accepted donations from major tobacco companies, according to tobacco companies documents and disclosures made to the . When asked, most thinktanks declined or failed to respond to requests to disclose donors.At least 25 free-market thinktanks opposed tobacco taxes, arguing they were “ineffective”, regressive or increased smuggling. In some cases, anti-tax campaigns are extensive, even though experts said taxes “are widely recognised as the most effective means” to reduce smoking.At least 30 free-market thinktanks were among 47 signatories to a letter from thinktanks to the WHO opposing plain packaging in 2016. And at least 14 free-market thinktanks wrote to the FDA in support of a Philip Morris International application to sell its IQOS devices in the US.Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco, Altria and Reynolds American all have donated to free-market thinktanks analyzed by the . In responses from manufacturers, they strongly disputed any suggestion donations could influence thinktank output.Some of the thinktanks are highly influential in their countries and well-connected, and some have received funding from diplomatic outposts. In the US, the Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute and Americans for Tax Reform all accepted donations from the tobacco industry and went on to comment on tobacco policy. In the UK, the Adam Smith Foundation and the Institute of Economic Affairs did the same.For example, the Heritage Foundation accepted donations from US Marlboro maker Altria in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016. In 2018, a Heritage scholar testified before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in favor of the new Philip Morris International product IQOS, which heats but does not burn tobacco, arguing it had an “impressive track record”.In responses to questions from the , the thinktanks said they are fiercely independent, unswayed by any donations, and they argue pro-business, low regulation and taxation positions as part of a broader free market philosophy. Some said they were not against all tobacco controls, hailed the rise of e-cigarettes in wealthier markets and said they were against “regressive” taxation on cigarettes they said hurts those on low incomes.Thinktanks exist to influence policy, often through policy guidance seen as independent of the interests of business and politics. Unlike lobbyists, thinktanks are not obligated to disclose their funding. However, the thinktank world has come under scrutiny in recent years, as donations from foreign governments and corporations came to light. In some cases, thinktanks appeared to operate like an echo chamber, with organizations within the network supporting one another’s research to reach similar conclusions.Plain packaging laws remove advertising from cigarette packs to encourage smokers to quit and deter young people from picking up the habit. The laws are part of a broader movement worldwide to control tobacco use.Australia first enacted plain packaging in 2012, and immediately found itself in the crosshairs of the tobacco industry, which argued plain packaging violated international trade agreements, infringed on commercial speech and are ineffective at reducing smoking. This  analysis shows tobacco companies also funded free-market thinktanks, many of which opposed plain packaging.Tobacco taxes increase the price of cigarettes, meant to encourage smokers to quit and make cigarettes unaffordable to young people. Taxes are the most effective, yet least utilized, tobacco control tool. The biggest hurdle to enacting taxes, experts say, is the tobacco industry’s well-funded opposition.In Montana alone, on America’s rural western plains, cigarette manufacturers spent nearly $85 for every smoker in the state to convince voters not to increase taxes by $2 a pack. The cigarette makers’ campaign succeeded, even though the money would have paid for healthcare for the poor and disabled.Cigarette makers argue tobacco taxes fuel black market smuggling and counterfeit production. In turn, cigarette companies and their allies say increased tobacco taxes cause violence, revenue loss and lead to more harmful cigarettes. Tobacco control experts have found companies exaggerate smuggling evidence, and groups such as the Fraser Institute often echo those concerns.In one study example, an International Agency for Research in Cancer expert panel found tax avoidance does not wipe out the public health benefits of increased tobacco taxes. In another example, researchers from the International Union Against Cancer suggested “tobacco manufacturers are the chief beneficiaries of smuggling”.Clean indoor air laws ban smoking inside, because secondhand smoke can cause smoking-related illnesses. Tobacco companies oppose these laws on the grounds they negatively impact businesses, infringe on inidual rights and are based on junk science.Although thousands of bars, restaurants and workplaces ban smoking indoors in the US and Europe, many developing countries have not yet enacted these measures.  found several thinktanks used these arguments to oppose clean indoor air laws in places such as Ghana and Hong Kong.“Freedom of speech needs to be respected as long as everything is transparent,” said Marquez. “In that way, everybody is aware who you are representing. In the same way we do when we receive grants.”Free-market thinktanks took positions aligned with the tobacco industry in countries including the US, UK, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Georgia, Ireland, Spain, Serbia, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Honduras, Venezuela, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Ghana, South Africa, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.In Ghana, the executive director of a free-market thinktank argued in 2013 that the link between cancer and smoking “was yet to be empirically established”, a claim the organization backed away from when questioned by the . The group was also part of an organized group which opposed plain packaging. In filings to the WHO, Ghana’s health department said civil society groups cited the thinktank as one which “fronts for the tobacco industry”. The group told the  it accepted donations from the tobacco industry about four years ago.In Malaysia, a free-market thinktank called the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas) argued against plain packaging and a proposed tobacco tax hike. The tax hike ultimately failed, as members of government cited concerns pushed by the thinktank about growth in smuggling. Public health experts said tobacco companies exaggerate the link between illicit trade and tobacco taxes. The thinktank disclosed in annual financials it received donations from the tobacco industry. Ideas said it follows “a strict policy of editorial independence” and that it did not consider its reliance on tobacco-funded research relevant.In Chile, a thinktank argued against new smoking restrictions, including an indoor smoking ban. Local journalists later obtained leaked documents which revealed the group was funded in part by BAT. BAT told the  it funded the organization by buying reports, which any company can do.Not all of the groups in the network that the  analyzed are active in tobacco policy, and some have done so in isolated instances. Some thinktanks issue policy papers around climate change skepticism, private education, pharmaceutical patent protections, energy deregulation and other conservative causes. In India, the  found one thinktank that made statements aligned with public health experts’ proposals for tobacco control.Atlas Network promotes its 475 “partner” thinktanks around the world, publicising campaigns and events on various issues, and providing some of this network with awards, grants and training.The bulk of Atlas’s work is unrelated to tobacco policy – in December 2018, for instance, the group promoted an American college student fighting to distribute the US constitution in Spanish and criticized a retail tax in Slovakia.It has, however, taken donations from tobacco firms in recent years and historically, and some Atlas partner thinktanks which have received grants have supported issues helpful to cigarette manufacturers. Some have also themselves taken tobacco industry donations.Atlas was founded in 1981 by Sir Antony Fisher, a British entrepreneur who found success factory farming chickens in the 1950s. Fisher then helped found the Institute for Economic Affairs, and went on to found Atlas Network. Since, Atlas worked to foster free-market thinktanks around the world on various issues, including promoting events by partner thinktanks.Like some of the thinktanks it supports, Atlas Network has history with the tobacco industry. Most thinktanks which received funding in the 1990s were “collaborators on public relations strategies or as allies in countering tobacco control efforts”, Smith said.In the 1990s, Philip Morris gave Atlas $275,000 for “ongoing activities”, and another $475,000 to Atlas for “tobacco issues management”. In 2001, Atlas Network received $75,000 from Philip Morris 2001, all according to the University of Bath database TobaccoTactics and documents obtained through tobacco litigation.Recently, Atlas Network accepted donations from British American Tobacco in 2015 and 2016, and from JTI-Macdonald Corp, Japan Tobacco’s Canadian subsidiary, in 2016. Its 2017 annual report showed no tobacco company contributions. has reached out to Atlas Network multiple times for comment, but received no response.In December, Atlas Network promoted on its website the opening of a branch of the Consumer Choice Center in Brazil, which Atlas said had opened in response to the Brazilian congress calling for plain packaging of cigarette packs.In another example, Atlas Network donated to the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Malaysia, which opposed plain packaging there. At the same time, the Malaysian thinktank was funded by local subsidiaries of Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco.Atlas Network accepted donations from BAT in 2015 and 2016, and from JTI-Macdonald Corp, Japan Tobacco’s Canadian subsidiary, in 2016. Its 2017 annual report showed no tobacco company contributions.“We definitely see there’s a growth of thinktanks in the developing world,” said Julia Smith, a research associate at Simon Fraser University in Canada who studies tobacco control and industry interference.Other researchers, such as Nobel prize-winning economist George Akerlof, said the growth of thinktanks aligned with the tobacco industry in the developing world “is exactly in line with what we would have expected” given the decline in smoking in the west. has contacted Atlas Network multiple times for comment but received no response.Researchers who study tobacco industry influence said organizations on both ends of the political spectrum have accepted tobacco donations, including civil rights groups and art organizations in the US.However, experts in tobacco influence said tobacco companies have recently favored libertarian and free market organizations, especially since the emergence of the American Tea Party movement about a decade ago.In most cases, the  relied on tobacco companies to disclose donations to thinktanks, rather than by the thinktanks themselves. Thinktanks are not obligated to disclose donors in the US, or in most countries around the world. Atlas Network voluntarily discloses names of donors, but not the amount of their donations.Manufacturers denied there was anything problematic about the behavior of thinktanks backing positions helpful to the industry. Altria, Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco (BAT), RJ Reynolds and Japan Tobacco International all donated to free-market thinktanks in the last decade.Philip Morris International told the  “ideas are not for sale”, a sentiment echoed by other tobacco companies. “We have worked, and will continue to work, with carefully selected organizations around the world who share our desire to promote policies that produce meaningful public health improvements,” PMI, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said. “It is absolutely ridiculous to imply that supporting an organization would result in a group taking action they otherwise would fundamentally oppose.“Claims that our contributions to organizations committed to advancing positive change in public health create a conflict of interest cannot withstand any reasonable scrutiny, are irrational, and wrong,” the company said.Japan Tobacco International said: “Various groups across the world share our view that any regulation, tobacco-related or not, if untested and unproven, could have seriously negative knock-on effects.”The company continued: “It is clear to everyone that there are health risks associated with smoking – we are fully transparent about this. And, as such, it is important that tobacco products are regulated.”BAT told the : “Like many other companies, we support like-minded organisations on issues that are important to our business and our consumers.“We believe publicly elected officials should be allowed to hear all sides of any debate when formulating policy and should be trusted to make informed decisions once they have heard and considered all the arguments,” the company said.Altria, the US maker of Marlboro cigarettes and donor to dozens of North American thinktanks, said: “Like most major corporations, Altria and its companies support and are members of policy-oriented organizations focused on issues that affect our business.“These organizations, which include trade associations and other membership organizations, engage in activities such as educational initiatives, professional development and training, public policy research and outreach, and direct or grassroots lobbying,” the company said. “We develop and maintain partnerships with third-party organizations on issues important to our companies and that independently research, communicate and advocate on those issues.”Reynolds American Incorporated did not respond to  requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf5aa4ddd3c6d0eef8b221b20692dd9997a14b/0_8_2449_1469/master/2449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88e48bcf9e1dff0b8aafcc9c4c1f8549","title":"which is the worlds most lgbt friendly city","story":"Even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different storyAmid a mass of colour and pounding Latin rhythms, revellers at this year’s Bogotá Pride march waved banners stating “not one step back”. They were among tens of thousands who took to the streets to celebrate and support Colombia’s LGBT community.Many annual Pride marches that were once solemn protests against repression have become celebrations of now-existing rights or progress, reflecting the strength of LGBT communities. In Bogotá, for example, the capital of a macho and socially conservative country, there has been surprising progress in LGBT rights.In March, Angélica Lozano Correa, a former member of the Bogotá city council, became the first openly LGBT person to be elected to the country’s Senate. In 2016 the country’s government passed laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt and marry, and the previous year it granted transgender people the right to change their identity on official government documents – policies which have allowed more equality and openness.But while these laws and political representation might suggest Bogotá is “friendly” and tolerant of the LGBT community, the issue is not clear-cut. This year’s Bogotá Pride march was marked by an undertone of resistance to and fear of the right-wing government of the new president, Ivan Duque.Duque openly opposes the LGBT-inclusive peace agreement his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, signed with leftist rebels Farc in 2016. Activists claim he is also against same-sex marriage and adoption rights.“Although the government promised there would be no setbacks to LGBT rights, the appointment of several anti-LGBT officials, cuts in resources for public policies and the continued strengthening of radical religious movements that promote hate speech and misinformation against the LGBT population are worrying,” says Marcela Sánchez, director of Colombia Diversa, a leading LGBT rights organisation.Indeed, determining a city’s attitude towards the LGBT community is complex. Studies that try to do this often look at political or legal metrics such as freedom to marry, or laws protecting against discrimination.Equaldex, a collaborative knowledge base for the global LGBT movement that maps the legality of homosexuality, identifies a number of factors including freedom to change gender and to adopt – although it hasn’t ranked countries or cities in order of best to worst.An index from the Human Rights Campaign looks at municipal services, law enforcement and the city leadership’s public position on equality across the US.Seventy-eight out of 506 US cities had a “perfect score” of 100, for reasons such as introducing trans-inclusive health benefits to city employees, as in Brookings, South Dakota. Birmingham, Alabama, obtained a full score for passing comprehensive nondiscrimination ordinances, along with other cities such as Cleveland in Ohio, a state that had previously prohibited same-sex marriage and civil unions.However, the Human Rights Campaign clearly states its index does not and cannot reflect a city’s friendliness.Other global surveys have tried to assess friendliness by covering public attitudes, access to nightlife and personal safety. A 2017 survey by the housing website Nestpick ranked the best LGBT cities by asking thousands of people how friendly they felt their city was based on safety and nightlife. Madrid, Amsterdam and Toronto came out as the top three.Arguably the size of the LGBT population in urban areas could reflect the level of friendliness, as “many LGBTI folk head to cities from rural areas because of the promise of a freer, more tolerant life there,” says André du Plessis, executive director of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.But even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different story.Brazil’s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro, has been branding itself as an LGBT tourist destination for years. It has made huge efforts in providing anti-bullying projects aimed at students, and has outlawed discrimination in nightclubs. However, the last year has seen record numbers of violent attacks against the queer community.And with a newly elected far-right government, there are fears it could get worse.Conversely, in some countries with backward and dangerous attitudes to the LGBT community, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, discreet but vibrant underground scenes can thrive. This is even the case in Russia, where activists say two people were killed last week and nearly 40 detained, as part of a new homophobic crackdown by police in the Chechnya region.“You’ll find a gay scene in many places that may surprise you,” says Ed Salvato, an LGBT travel expert. “Some places like Moscow and St Petersburghave vibrant gay communities, despite the homophobic laws there.”In Dublin, an exciting scene exploded out of a staunchly Catholic country.“Dublin is like gay Disneyland now, and that wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago,” says Prof Andrew Reynolds, founder of the University of North Carolina’s LGBTQ Representation and Rights Research Initiative.“With the last couple of referendums, Ireland and Dublin have embraced their new presentation as an inclusive, progressive and loving place.”He says: “They went to Australia. They went to America. Now they’ve come home.”The political glass ceiling has broken for many LGBT people across the world, which inevitably has ripple effects on the community. Minneapolis made US history last year by electing Andrea Jenkins, the first openly trans woman of colour to office in 2017. The gay stronghold of Palm Springs, California, has elected an entire city council that identifies as LGBT. And in November, Jared Polis became the first openly gay man to be elected as a US state governor.In Poland, one of Europe’s most Catholic and conservative countries, voters in the small city of Slupsk this year elected a gay atheist mayor, Robert Biedron. Just a few years ago, Biedron was attacked on the streets of his city because of his sexuality.In Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunil Pant became Asia’s first openly gay federal-level elected official in 2008, resulting in a spate of public scrutiny.“I think that the spinoff is that Kathmandu is a lot more gay-friendly than it was before,” says Reynolds. “Whilst it is not perfect by any stretch, like Bogotá, it is a place now that I feel like is much more friendly and accepting – and that’s obviously coming from a place where the Hindu religion was not helpful before.”As the most direct representatives of citizens, city officials are uniquely positioned to understand and address the needs of their communities, says Xavier Persad of the Human Rights Campaign, pointing to “the need to provide for one’s family without the fear of being fired, to secure housing without the fear of eviction, and to participate in community life”.“When cities enact LGBTQ-inclusive protections,” he adds, “they send a clear message that they value and welcome everyone, attracting the country’s top talent and spurring economic growth.”Ultimately, even the most progressive laws and equal representation at political levels do not necessarily reflect the efficiency of enforcement, or indeed capture the lived experience of discrimination and fear many LGBT people face every day.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04dc981106ad569046908624ba8a4897e7139225/182_274_2970_1781/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcd0c5fe1093cdcb3291d007a187a02f","title":"irish readers citizens assembly worked brexit","story":"Ireland’s assembly of 99 citizens found consensus on emotive issues – a model readers think could help the Brexit processWhile the Brexit debacle rumbles ever on, several outcomes are on the table, including the possibility of a second referendum. Some, including this newspaper, have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen, a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades: abortion.We wanted to find out from Irish citizens why they felt the assembly helped to bring about consensus. Here’s what some of them said.Dee, works in education, County Louth Abortion has long been considered politically toxic in Ireland, with our elected representatives loth to touch it in case it alienated their constituents and risked their political careers. The Citizens’ Assembly took the debate out of this realm of fearful self-interested calculation and into a forum where evidence and experience could take centre stage. Interest in the workings of the assembly meant that the media could report on this evidence, leading to a better-informed public and lessening the hysteria that circulates around debates based on dogma. It led to a growing realisation that the 8th amendment affected people in a wide variety of ways even during wanted pregnancies, and revealed the chilling effect it had on medical professionals’ ability to provide necessary healthcare. The members of the assembly were faced with expert testimony on medical and legal matters but also testimony from their fellow citizens whose lives were deeply impacted by the 8th.It meant that there was a long lead-in to the referendum during which debate was reasoned and detailed, before the inevitable agitation of the campaign itself. The fact that it was citizens who recommended the terms of the referendum and informed the proposed legislation introduced greater clarity, and meant voters did not just have to trust politicians since a representative body of their fellow citizens had carefully reflected on the matter and recommended these changes following significant education and deep reflection on the situation. I think the success of the Citizens’ Assembly is evidenced by the fact that the proportion in favour of repeal mirrored so closely the final vote.I was initially very sceptical. The previous discussions on abortion were rife with emotion, and the country was very ided. I was dreading the decisive nature of what I thought was a cop-out. However, I was completely wrong. Issues were discussed logically and with complete transparency and fairness. The result was a revelation in many ways. The extreme for and against arguments were shown to be just that: extreme arguments. The plain, simple facts were what mattered and brought logic to an apparently intractable issue.It is an unbeatable process. I think it would have helped the whole Brexit process had it been followed. However, Ireland had to go through years of hell to finally use it. A shame that our friends and neighbours did not follow it, but then a nation has to have its own learning curve.The Citizens’ Assembly meant the discussion about our abortion laws was led by the people rather than politicians. It’s interesting to see international interest in it, as at the time a lot of people felt it was set up as a way of kicking the can down the road. An awful lot of people against the 8th amendment were calling for the assembly to be scrapped and wanted an immediate referendum. The sentiment was understandable but I personally felt it would have been incredibly irresponsible and undemocratic to hold a referendum on revoking the 8th amendment without having proposed legislation as to what would go in its place. It is absolutely critical that people understand what it is they are voting for.Crucially, a citizens’ assembly is non-partisan and so it creates a people-led discussion and understanding of an issue. I think this also helps create a debate that isn’t dominated by black-and-white mantras from political parties but a more nuanced discussion of the issue in question. Furthermore, politics can feel far removed from the average person and so the discussion and findings can feel far more relatable.There was no trouble accessing the assembly findings as every time they met, the national TV channel, the newspapers and online-only news forums comprehensively reported the assembly’s activities. Unless you chose to stick your head in the clouds, you could not avoid hearing or reading about the assembly. This was not done in an overbearing way, as initially the assembly met once a month, so you were content to tune in to update yourself. I feel this was very important for people who never would have considered voting in favour of abortion. It motivated young people to vote for a subject very important to them, and opened up debate among people in general. The greatest thing the assembly did was get balanced and truthful information out among the people of Ireland.A citizens’ assembly has revealed itself to me to be a vital tool in a democracy – it takes the debating of a contentious issue right back down into the hands of people on the electoral roll. This is great as our politicians are so often tied into a certain viewpoint based on political agenda, party politics or personal gain. I feel a citizens’ assembly would be a very helpful tool in the Brexit dilemma.The assembly facilitated the presentation of a whole range of views and insights on the topic. The media coverage of presentations triggered a lot of discussion. Expert input at the forum informed public opinion and thus facilitated greater understanding of the issues at play in crisis pregnancies. For many, the revelation that abortion pills could be bought on the internet was a game changer. Clearly, women taking such pills without medical supervision are seriously imperilled. The realisation that abortion was already reasonably prevalent in our society led people to see that it is best for society to accept its reality and provide for safe provision under medical care.The Citizens’ Assembly, with due thanks to its chair, provided a forum where the real story was told. The broad spectrum of experience, case histories and moral viewpoints was set out for evaluation and consideration. Misrepresentation was not an option, for proponents or opponents. There was no “bluster bus”. If there is a second Brexit referendum, it should be preceded by a citizens’ assembly, chaired by an experienced judge and supported by an expert team of fact checkers.It felt very democratic. All sides were addressed. It very much helped me – not to decide as I already knew how I was voting, but to listen, understand and develop empathy for those who planned to vote the other way. The issue was a very complex and isive one, and the Citizens’ Assembly helped the issue be seen from all sides. This is not a simple issue of right or wrong. Interpersonal discussions on the issue often became emotional, leading to them becoming deadlocked. The Citizens’ Assembly kept information flowing whether we liked to hear it or not. The fact that it was made up entirely of my peers, and that through the assembly we the voters were exposed to the thoughts and opinions of experts from both sides, very much helped to establish a belief that this was a vote of the people and that we were being given all the information available in order to make up our minds. We weren’t being preached at or lied to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf8fa65ae71b52f004960671503bc2dd3f4d2a4/0_14_1753_1052/master/1753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f57d03fb41435484406605e9d963b520","title":"cosmopolitan sweden far right refuge europe","story":"I was born in Turkey and am now based in Lund, on the southern tip of Sweden. Most of my life I’ve probably been the quintessential cosmopolitan, and proudly so. But I’ve also spent too many hours in the consulates and airports of various EU countries coveting a multiple-entry Schengen visa, or enduring the suspicious looks of customs officers, to believe that I could be a “citizen of nowhere” with a Turkish passport.My cosmopolitanism was more a moral ideal based on compassion, and did not preclude a yearning for belonging or roots. It simply defined them in a different way. I could have roots in many places, and I could nourish my need for belonging from a variety of sources.With this background, it is not very surprising that I took up a job offer in Sweden in 2011. To be sure, it was not easy to adapt to the notorious Nordic winter and the idiosyncrasies of the Swedish way of life, not least the obsession with moderation (“lagom”) and modesty (“jantelagen”), which manifests itself as an unwavering commitment to consensus and the need to avoid confrontation at all costs.Sweden has become one of my many homes, and with the birth of my son in 2013, it became the first among equals. Having a family and living in a small university town was perfectly compatible with my understanding of cosmopolitanism, which, drawing on the Stoics, regarded these affiliations as a series of concentric circles, starting with the local and extending into the societal and global. I could not imagine at that point that my cosmopolitanism would begin to crack under the pressure of several developments.First, I started to appreciate the value of Sweden’s welfare state, which for four and a half years took great care of my son after he fell seriously ill and until he passed away in July 2018. I developed a sense of loyalty to the social contract that underpinned the Swedish state – a feeling I’d never felt before, either in the country where I was born and raised, or in others where I’d spent a good chunk of my life. I wasn’t even a citizen of Sweden (though my son was), but that did not matter when it came to a child’s life, nor did the amount of taxes I paid or the type of permit I held.But I was also exposed to the more unpleasant aspects of the Swedish social contract: a token egalitarianism that trumps all notions of meritocracy, an extreme understanding of political correctness, and a corporatist alliance between employers and labour unions. These aspects are little known to outsiders, who often tend to glorify the “Swedish model”.After my son’s funeral, I travelled outside Sweden to resume a nomadic lifestyle. I was torn. I now had a better understanding of the tensions between citizenship and a borderless universalism, or the type of cosmopolitanism the likes of Theresa May or Nigel Farage have attacked. I’d witnessed the immense pressure that the refugee crisis of 2015-16 placed on the Swedish government. Then came the unstoppable rise of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party, which would soon become the third largest in parliament.I also found myself to a certain extent sympathising with the opprobrium that populist demagogues and rightwing commentators heaped on prevailing forms of political correctness. I’d become the victim of such vigilantism myself, one that pays little heed to due process or other fundamental values such as empathy.On top of that, the Europe I’d sought refuge in was not the Europe I once thought it was. Sweden was simply following in the footsteps of a host of other countries that were mutilated by the far-right juggernaut. Nationalism was – once again – the order of the day, with a slightly different script in which the lead role was given to “threatened white majorities” or “majority ethnic anxieties”. All this happened under the watchful eyes of academic snipers who did not hesitate to target any remaining sign of more universalist visions.Basically, I had two options. The easy one was to jump on the bandwagon, recant my earlier cosmopolitan convictions and start penning pieces about the virtues of the rightwing populist backlash. This would require adopting a politics of euphemism where good old nationalism is sugar-coated as “national citizen favouritism” and where racism is confined to the marginal domain of white supremacists, or the “alt-right”. This goes hand in hand with a politics of whitewashing, whereby far-right ideas and discourses are made mainstream, all with the pretext of understanding the genuine and legitimate concerns of the downtrodden.The second option was more difficult as it entailed serious, introspective reckoning. If I were to reclaim my cosmopolitan moral agenda, I would have to acknowledge the centrality of shared values to solidarity and trust.I had to understand that the central question is, as the Swedish historian Lars Trägårdh puts it, whether it is possible to resolve the fundamental tension between, on the one side, “universal moral rules founded in notions of human rights”, and on the other, “nationally bounded claims derived from the idea of citizenship in particular nation states”.My answer is yes, and the formula is simple: emphasise the connection between rights and duties speed up the process of integration of newcomers (refugees or migrants) without demanding that they fully assimilate into the dominant culture, but asking them to respect the existing social contract foster a sense of common destiny that does not necessarily require myths of common ancestry and engage with the demand for recognition in a fair and equal way, without privileging either minorities or majorities.The point here is that a sense of civic duty does not entail expecting citizens to turn into cosmopolitans. And a moral concern for the refugees and migrants who risk their lives to provide their children with a better future does not require us to care less about our own children. The yearning for home, or to protect one’s home, does not entail isolation, for there are many homes and many definitions of home.“Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition,” the novelist James Baldwin said. Perhaps that’s the answer: to think of cosmopolitanism as an irrevocable condition, much like love.• Umut Özkırımlı is a political scientist and professor at Lund University, Sweden, and the author of Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b96487ad15bf214b33cf88eac74fa8d85ddb665b/0_297_4535_2721/master/4535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f41cb47b16f83a8bf0fd4d6ba1e037","title":"emmanuel macron presidency gilets jaunes","story":"Earlier this month, in an open letter to French citizens, President Emmanuel Macron suggested that introducing immigration quotas might help address the gilets jaunes crisis. This predictably made many on the left cringe. It also brought to mind a Hillary Clinton interview in the  last year, in which she gave her views on the root cause of rightwing populism. “I think Europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame,” she said. Clinton argued that populists should be fought on their own ground and that liberal parties should develop a tougher line on immigration.As someone who took part in Macron’s presidential campaign, I beg to differ. With Europe just a few months away from a crucial EU parliamentary election in which both left and rightwing populists will seek to make gains, the urgent task that democrats and liberals must embrace is this: bursting the bubbles we live in. Understanding public opinion is incredibly difficult. In 2016 my data analysis firm helped set up Macron’s grassroots En Marche! movement, which started with the “Grande Marche”: a huge door-to-door operation, collecting the views of thousands of citizens across France.Public opinion is like an iceberg: it is easy to know what people at the tip think, mostly because they tweet, post on social media, speak on TV or write in newspapers but it’s far more complicated to penetrate what lies below the surface, to know what the silent majority thinks.Suggesting that a tougher line on immigration could curb the rise of populism would be convincing only if immigration really was a priority for citizens who have voted for populists, or are about to do so. Yet that’s not at all what the data bears out.To get a full picture, you need to burst the separate thought bubbles we all live in, and new technologies and large-scale data collection make that possible. It’s a cliche to say that the amount of data generated online has exploded. Offline data is just as important. Conversations with people living in neighbourhoods where the share of the populist vote has dramatically risen in recent elections can deliver surprising results.A study my company helped conduct in France and Germany relied on the following principle: the best way to get people to share what’s on their mind is to ask face-to-face, open-ended and non-expert questions which anyone can answer, such as: “What worksdoes not work in your citycountry?”, “What would you change in politics?”, “What worries you about the future?”. This is the kind of doorstepping, listening-mode fieldwork the Grande Marche initiative was based on, and which helped Macron identify the issues that mattered most to French people ahead of the 2017 presidential campaign. The key to success would be a political message that focused on convincing citizens they’d be fully taken into account, not left by the wayside.Data collected in France and Germany reveals that the reason why citizens who are drawn to populist parties hold grudges against the “media and politics”, is because they adopt an “agenda” that doesn’t at all fit their concerns. Those main concerns are “precarious working conditions, worries about money and declining social infrastructure”. Data drawn from door-to-door conversations shows that rightwing populist parties’ central anti-immigration narrative is far less prevalent among their voter base than is generally assumed.Migrants aren’t what people spontaneously mention if they’re truly asked about their lives. Rather, they complain about a lack of attention from politicians and public institutions. Voters who lean towards populist parties, whether left or right, often say they feel “abandoned”.It is true that the 2015-16 refugee crisis in Europe exacerbated a widespread sense of abandonment. But the lessons drawn from the study are clear: a growing number of citizens feel trapped, and have lost all hope that their life, and their children’s lives, will ever improve. They want politicians to listen more to them, to better understand the challenges people are confronted with, and to offer practical solutions – not scapegoats.That’s why talk of tougher immigration policies can only be shortsighted. We all form our political views within different bubbles, and in ways that can often fuel misunderstandings and polarisation. These bubbles make it impossible to build a common vision for the future. My work analysing voters’ perceptions in different European countries has convinced me that social and political bubbles are one of the largest problems we face today.This also applies to Macron’s current difficulties. He is trying to implement emergency policy measures to end the gilets jaunes crisis that has shaken his presidency – hence his two-month national grassroots consultation, launched by his open letter. Here again, it’s easy to see only the tip of the iceberg: the popular complaint against taxes and low purchasing power that lit the initial flame.Responding with tax cuts and talk of limiting immigration may only go so far. In fact it might well be the equivalent of Clinton’s ill-conceived recipe against populism. Showing a capacity to truly listen to people is more important. Macron’s challenge now is to convince citizens his “great national debate” can deliver just that.Short-term fixes won’t solve the problem of people feeling cut off from decision-makers. Sounding out the deeper layers of society, collecting data offline by taking the time to hear out citizens in a more profound way – not just through instant polling – is a better place to start. It would also help form policies that can change people’s lives for the better in the long term. If the populist danger can be averted in Europe, a key part of the solution lies not in pandering to anti-migrant slogans, but in working to burst the bubbles people are all too often locked into.• Guillaume Liegey is CEO of LMP, a Paris-based start-up that analyses public opinion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c129e04f5ea91353ebbf145b035674658c1c7e71/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6322367d44afd79068996a31e368c097","title":"panic davos inequality global elite","story":"The results of the rampant inequality engineered by the global elite are finally catching up with themPity the poor billionaire, for today he feels a new and unsettling emotion: fear. The world order he once clung to is crumbling faster than the value of the pound. In its place, he frets, will come chaos. Remember this, as the plutocrats gather this week high above us in the ski resort of Davos: they are terrified.Whatever dog-eared platitudes they may recycle for the TV cameras, what grips them is the havoc far below. Just look at the new report from the summit organisers that begins by asking plaintively, “Is the world sleepwalking into a crisis?” In the accompanying survey of a thousand bosses, money men (because finance, like wealth, is still mainly a male thing) and other “Davos decision-makers”, nine out of 10 say they fear a trade war or other “economic confrontation between major powers”. Most confess to mounting anxieties about “populist and nativist agendas” and “public anger against elites”. As the cause of this political earthquake, they identify two shifting tectonic plates: climate change and “increasing polarisation of societies”.In its pretend innocence, its barefaced blame-shifting, its sheer ruddy sauce, this is akin to arsonists wailing about the flames from their own bonfire.

They have rigged an economic system so that it paid them bonanzas and stiffed others. They have lobbied and funded politicians to give them the easiest of rides. Topped with red Maga caps and yellow vests, this backlash is uglier and more uncouth than anything you’ll see in the snow-capped Alps, but the high rollers meeting there can claim exec producer credits for the whole rotten lot. Shame it’s such a downer for idends.This week’s report from Oxfam is just the latest to put numbers to this hoarding of wealth and power. One single minibus-load of fatcats – just 26 people – now own as much as half the planet’s population, and the collective wealth of the billionaire class swells by $2.5bn every day. This economic polarisation is far more obscene than anything detested by Davos man, and it is the root cause of the social and political ide that now makes his world so unstable.No natural force created this intense unfairness. The gulf between the super-rich and the rest of us did not gape wide open overnight. Rather, it has been decades in the widening and it was done deliberately. The UK was the frontline of the war to create greater inequality: in her first two terms as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher more than halved the top rate of income tax paid by high earners. She broke the back of the trade unions. Over their 16 years in office, Thatcher and John Major flogged off more public assets than France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Australia and Canada put together.Oh, shrug the Davos set, that’s ancient history. It is no such thing. Thatcher may be gone but her ideology keeps on taking cash out of your pay packets. If workers today got the same share of national income as in the 70s, we would be far better off. According to calculations from the Foundational Economy collective of researchers, a full-time employee now on the median salary of £29,574 would get a pay rise of £5,471.Meanwhile, FTSE bosses enjoy skyrocketing pay, precisely because bonus schemes give them part-ownership of the big companies they run. So Jeff Fairburn of the housebuilder Persimmon took £47m in 2018 before getting the boot, which works out at £882 for each £1 earned by an average worker at the firm.Where Thatcher’s shock troops led, the rest of the west more or less followed. Political leaders across the spectrum gave the rich what they wanted. It didn’t matter whether you voted for Tony Blair or David Cameron, Bill Clinton or George W Bush, either way you got Davos man. They cut taxes for top earners and for businesses, they uprooted the public sector to create opportunities for private firms, and they struck trade deals negotiated in secret that gave big corporations as much as they could ever dream of.At last, more than a decade after the banking crash, the regime has run out of road. Hence the popular anger, so ferocious that the political and financial elites can neither comprehend nor control it. I can think of no better metaphor for the current disarray of the Davos set than the fact that Emmanuel Macron – surely the elite’s platonic ideal of a politician, with his eyes of leporid brightness, his stint as an investment banker and his start-up party – cannot attend this week’s jamboree because he has to stay at home and deal with the gilets jaunes. It’s a bummer when the working poor spoil your holiday plans.They care about other people’s problems – so long as they get to define them, and it’s never acknowledged that they are a large part of the problem. Which they are. If they want capitalism to carry on, the rich will need to give up their winnings and cede some ground. That point evades them. Welcoming Donald Trump last year, Klaus Schwab, Davos’s majordomo, praised the bigot-in-chief’s tax cuts for the rich and said, “I’m aware that your strong leadership is open to misconceptions and biased interpretations.” The super-rich don’t hate all populists – just those who refuse to make them richer.Cutting the ribbon on this new economic order back in the 80s, Ronald Reagan claimed that the nine most terrifying words in the English language were: “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” A joke perhaps, but the intention was real enough. The last three decades have seen the political and economic elites hack away at our social scaffolding – rights, taxes and institutions. It proved profitable, for a while, but now it threatens their own world. And still they block the quite reasonable alternatives of more taxes on wealth, of more power for workers, of companies not run solely to enrich their owners. The solutions to this crisis will not be handed down from a mountain top to the grateful hordes: they will rely on us taking power for ourselves. Three decades after Reagan, the nine most laughable words in the English language are: “I’m from the elite and I’m here to help.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef093125eb7aef2c4dc34e2721d8757d7f26c56/0_533_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22b36ccc08407a7c1decf475b8eb235a","title":"postgraduate pressure expectations can feel impossible to sustain","story":"Fear of failure is one of many concerns for postgrad students. What’s in place to safeguard their wellbeing?For more than a decade, post-doctoral researcher Liz Mistry found it hard to leave her bed. “I felt so lonely, some days I would pull the covers over my head and cry for hours.”Creative writing helped her manage her depression and she went on to complete a master’s at Leeds Trinity in 2016. Mistry believes that postgraduate researchers need to be able to share experiences and support each other to stay healthy. “Isolation is one of the main issues that affect students’ mental wellbeing,” she says. “Developing a community with good support mechanisms and access to mental health practitioners is key.”Undergraduates’ wellbeing has grabbed headlines, but the experiences of postgraduates – researchers in particular – are not so often considered. Some feel isolated, according to research published this year by Vitae and the Institute for Employment Studies (IES).“They might suffer anxiety about whether they deserve their place at university,” says Sally Wilson, who led IES’s contribution to the research. “Postgraduates can feel as though they are in a vacuum. They don’t know how to structure their time. Many felt they didn’t get support from their supervisor.”Taught students tend to fare better than researchers – they enjoy more structure and contact, says Sian Duffin, student support manager at Arden University. But she believes anxiety is on the rise. “The pressure to gain distinction grades is immense,” she says. “Fear of failure can lead to perfectionism, anxiety and depression.”Younger postgraduates who’ve come straight from undergraduate study might suffer from burnout, particularly if they performed well in their first degree. “Expectations can feel impossible to sustain. The feeling of ‘not good enough’ can erode confidence and self-esteem.”With more postgraduates forced to live at home, universities are losing what psychologist and author Audrey Tang calls “that campus feel”. Staff at Brunel University, where she runs mindfulness sessions for postgraduates, try to intercept students before they hit crisis point and require help from counsellors – whose services are nearly always overbooked at many institutions.Since the summer, 17 universities have won up to £150,000 each (totalling £1.5m) from the Office for Students to target postgraduate wellbeing. Some, such as the University of Manchester and University of Sussex, are linking with NHS services and training both staff and students. Leeds Beckett and Portsmouth are investing in initiatives to change attitudes and awareness of mental health. Derby and the University of the West of England are developing web-based resources and apps to help students connect with each other and help intervene early. “These are early projects,” says Wilson. “They’re trying to understand exactly what is needed – it’s not one size fits all.”If students do slip through the net, it’s important emergency provision doesn’t depend on a single staff member, says Clare Dickens, mental health and wellbeing coordinator at the University of Wolverhampton, where the award-winning “three minutes to save a life” suicide prevention scheme is being rolled out.Nearly 450 student union officers and staff – from caretakers to academic staff and the vice-chancellor – have been trained in how to recognise and act on early warning signs. “It’s not helpful just to tell students to go and seek help,” says Dickens. “If someone is in obvious emotional pain, then literally a few minutes of your time could save them. You haven’t got to sit there for three hours – that’s not your job. But we must respond with compassion.”As a postgraduate, you will have many demands on your time. But if you don’t stay healthy, or work too long on autopilot, you might lose attention to detail, miss opportunities and burn out personally and professionally. If the world around you is not going to slow down, says psychologist Dr Audrey Tang, who wrote The Leader’s Guide to Mindfulness, you’ll need to find a way to manage.Looking after yourself, she says, is not unnecessary or indulgent: if you’re physically, emotionally and mentally healthy, you’ll perform better for yourself and others.Set “office hours” and don’t engage in work-related matters after a certain time (as much as teaching requirements allow).Fresh air and time away from your work always does you good. A daily walk – maybe with a friend or family – will re-energise you.Yoga, tai chi and other relaxation therapies can clear the mind. Just 30 minutes exercise three times a week has been proved to lift mood.Make sure you take a proper lunch break – that means physically stepping away from where you’re working.Break down tasks – completing achievable goals will give you a sense of satisfaction. Identify mood patterns and try to plan your day to suit these.Go to social and wellbeing events on offer. “Attend any extra seminars, lectures and events in your field – you can build common ground. It’s a boost for academic and pastoral wellbeing,” says former postgraduate Philippa Bunch.Don’t be afraid to reach out and ask for help, companionship or just a chat.If you feel lonely or anxious in new social situations, take it slowly – or try a class where you can immerse yourself in the activity, rather than focus on needing to speak to people straight away.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org.

When it comes to clothes, it’s very much the same story.At the preview of its springsummer 2019 womenswear collection, the message is one of consistency and simplicity.“We need to stop thinking too much about everybody else and really focus on what makes M\u0026ampS great,” said Jill Stanton, who was enticed back from California last year after a 20-year hiatus to become the trading director of womenswear and kids. “Coming back to the UK and to M\u0026ampS, I realised how much goodwill we have as a company,” she said. “It’s a fantastic position to be in because it doesn’t feel like you have barriers.”Stanton is a part of a new team – along with the new head of womenswear, Lisa Illis, and the head of lingerie, Soozie Jenkinson – attempting to assess what these barriers are. Their plan is to achieve consistency in order to strengthen customer loyalty and streamline collections to ensure they have a product that, in Stanton’s words, “appeals to all age groups: from the sporty girl to the pretty girl to the classic girl”.It is not a world away from what her predecessors spoke about at M\u0026ampS’s last preview, although the Limited Edition collection has been absorbed in the interim, leaving the womenswear category with three collections: Autograph, M\u0026ampS Collection and the best-selling Per Una. A fifth line, Indigo, was phased out in 2016. There is now a focus on “wardrobing” rather than “outfitting” to enable customers to choose pieces from across the collections over a six-month period that complement each other and achieve the high-low mix that Illis believes customers crave.A focus for the season will be denim. Stanton said it was an area where M\u0026ampS was the market leader, although she acknowledged that, in order to keep up that momentum, M\u0026ampS needed to be broadly thought of as a No 1 destination for denim. The television presenter Holly Willoughby, who was appointed as brand ambassador in September, is selecting “Holly’s Must-Haves”, many of which sell out in record time. Her next selection is a series of denim miniskirts, dresses and jeans.With M\u0026ampS able to attract 19.5 million shoppers every week, the loyal customers are still there, enabling Stanton to concentrate on the “areas of the business that are really great for us”. Focusing on what the company’s womenswear customers want and, more importantly, actually buy will form a significant part of CEO Steve Rowe’s promise to leave “no stone unturned” as he looks to overhaul “every aspect” of its struggling stores in a bid to reverse fortunes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Not that you need any such excuse to make this deliciously citrussy pudding, as warming and fluffy as a big bobble hat and equally welcome on a cold winter’s evening.Like syrup sponge and jam roly-poly, marmalade pudding belongs to a category often rather dismissively referred to as “nursery puddings”, a term that carries an offputting whiff of the Rees-Mogg. Whether or not you grew up with them, such dishes are our finest culinary hour – I would say export, except we don’t really. Perhaps you have to live in the UK’s peculiarly damp, grey climate to truly appreciate them as historian Dr Annie Gray writes in the foreword to Regula Ysewjin’s glorious survey Pride and Pudding, “pudding and Britishness are inexplicably linked”. Stodgy and sweet, comforting and solid – whatever happens this year, at least we’ll always have pudding.Even leaving aside the modern usage as a synonym for dessert, puddings are a remarkably wide class of foodstuffs. Ysewijn lists no fewer than six categories in her introduction, from haggis to jelly, and recipes for marmalade pudding show a similar ersity of form. Arabella Boxer’s Book of English Food, Joyce Molyneux’s The Carved Angel Cookery Book and Shirley Spear of Skye’s Three Chimneys restaurant all go for the traditional steamed version, with Molyneux making it in roly-poly form. I’m unable to find a hinged pudding sleeve of the size Molyneux recommends, which makes me doubly sad: first, because I can’t try her recipe, and, second, because there seems to be no demand for such things. Whither the roly-polys of yesteryear?Moving on swiftly, Nigella Lawson makes a baked sponge, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall a kind of creamy flan and Clarissa Dickson Wright a batter pudding she attributes to her Aberdonian grandmother – “Scotland is, as you probably know, the home of marmalade as we know it” (a controversial claim I’ll step hastily away from).All are, of course, very different beasts, and delicious in their own right, though the unfortunate combination of vagueness about cooking vessels and precision about cooking times leads to a bit of a disaster involving liquid batter in Dickson Wright’s case. The cooked edge I try, as I scrape it sadly into the bin, is pleasant enough, though, like all decent egg-heavy batters, undeniably stodgy. Lawson’s is far more successful. Fluffy and buttery, it’s simplicity itself to make, especially if you happen to have a food processor and, unlike Fearnley-Whittingstall’s luxuriously rich version, works well with custard – a must, as far as I’m concerned.Most popular of all, however, particularly among those who didn’t have to tend them for two hours, are the steamed puddings, which have a pleasingly open texture that forestalls any accusations of heaviness, and the kind of moist, sticky texture you just don’t get in the oven. Though they take longer to cook, they’re generally quicker to prepare, and, really, topping up a saucepan with boiling water every 30 minutes is hardly the most onerous of tasks.Many of the recipes I try make use of stale breadcrumbs, much like a treacle tart. Spear mixes them with a little wholemeal self-raising flour, while Fearnley-Whittingstall and Boxer rely on crumbs alone. Lawson’s straightforward sponge recipe uses just flour, as does Dixon-Wright’s batter. Although it’s perfectly possible to make a steamed sponge rather than a baked one, we all agree that we rather like the slightly drier, chewier texture that the crumbs bring to the party, but a little flour is very helpful as a binder, especially if your homemade breadcrumbs aren’t quite as fine as the commercial variety (ahem). White bread is fine, of course, but Spear’s brown gives a better flavour and, more noticeably, colour – and if you use a seeded loaf, as I did in extremis, a more interesting consistency, too. In fact, the odd crunch proves such a hit with testers that I’m moved to add a handful of coarse oatmeal for your textural pleasure.Boxer uses suet, Spear and Lawson butter, and Fearnley-Whittingstall double cream and egg yolks to enrich the mixture. Double cream, so rarely a bad idea, dulls the sharp flavour of the citrus and, much as I like the airy texture suet provides, here the combination of butter and marmalade feels too good to miss.Only Boxer makes no attempt to lighten the load with raising agents. Lawson and Spear use baking powder and bicarbonate of soda, while Dickson Wright and Fearnley-Whittingstall both fold beaten egg whites into their batters. As Lawson and Spear’s puddings are the runaway favourites here, I’m going with the belt-and-braces approach and sticking in both baking powder and bicarb.First, choose your marmalade. Lawson knows whereof she writes: “I love the bitter edge of a thick-shred, dark marmalade and so tend to go for a proper, glamorously auburn, tawny one.” Indeed, I’m accused of having forgotten to add it to the one recipe I try with shredless golden marmalade. Spear reckons that “homemade is always the best”, but then she’s written a whole book on the subject. There are many excellent commercially produced marmalades out there, and you might not want to use up so much of your hard-won stash on one pudding, so go with whatever you happen to prefer, though make sure it has at least some peel in it, to give both flavour and texture. (If you don’t like peel, this is probably not the pudding for you.)One might imagine that, much like treacle sponge, the marmalade simply sits on top of the pudding, as in Dickson Wright’s version, but, in fact, it’s more common to incorporate it into the batter. As Spear notes apropos of hers: “It is not, as some people imagine, a stodgy suet pudding with a dollop of marmalade at the bottom of the basin. The marmalade is combined throughout, giving the dessert a rich, amber colour.” I miss the jammy, caramelised top, though, so, while I’ve based my recipe on her excellent one, I’m going to have my cake and eat it by adding a big spoonful of marmalade to the basin, too.Unless you are very spartan of taste, you’ll also need some other sort of sweetener. Caster sugar is the most common choice, but I like the darker, caramelised flavour of Boxer and Spear’s light muscovado, which works brilliantly with the marmalade.Dickson Wright adds ginger to her batter a little spice is an excellent idea in a winter pudding. Sadly, none of us can taste the warming whisky in Fearnley-Whittingstall’s batter, while a grating of citrus zest is another nice optional extra.Boxer, Spear and Dickson Wright all make sauces to pair with their puddings: Boxer a rich mixture of cream, marmalade and orange juice Spear a Drambuie egg custard and Dickson Wright a tangy orange and lemon juice number. All of which are very nice indeed. But, I must confess, I cannot be entirely objective here: puddings deserve custard. Plain custard, preferably cornflour-based custard to slip thickly over the fluffy batter rather than sinking in. Ice-cream or double cream are acceptable alternatives, at a push. All complaints should be addressed below.120g butter, plus extra for greasing150g coarse-cut marmalade 150g fresh fine brown breadcrumbs (ie not dried, though stale is fine)25g coarse oatmeal (optional)25g wholemeal self-raising flour120g light muscovado sugar1 tsp ground ginger ¼ tsp fine salt3 large eggs, beatenZest of 1 orange1 tsp bicarbonate of sodaMelt the butter and 120g of the marmalade in a pan, stirring to break it up. Set aside. Butter a two-pint pudding basin.Put the breadcrumbs, oatmeal, flour, sugar, ginger and salt into a large bowl and stir together. Add the eggs and the orange zest, then stir in the melted buttery marmalade mix. Dissolve the bicarbonate of soda in a tablespoon of cold water and stir into the batter.Spoon the remaining 30g of marmalade into the bottom of the basin, then pour in the batter. Cover tightly, either with a lid or a pleated piece of greaseproof paper and the same of foil, secured with a string handle (this video may help if this is your first time making a steamed pudding the important thing is that it’s steam-tight).Put the basin in a steamer (or a saucepan with a lid), and fill with boiling water to about halfway up the basin. Steam on low heat for about two hours, topping up with boiling water as necessary. Lift out the pudding basin, leave to sit for five minutes, then remove the lid and turn out on to a serving dish. Don’t worry if some of the marmalade topping sticks to the basin – just spoon it back on top.Serve immediately, or leave to cool and reheat in a microwave or the steamer. Serve with custard, ice-cream or cream.• Is this pudding the best use of marmalade outside hot-buttered toast, or do you have other dishes up your sleeve?

More updates as information becomes available.”Officers have made it clear that if the fourth option – that the footballer and pilot ended up in the water – is correct, chances of survival are slim.A spokesperson for Guernsey police said at 11.30am: “There are currently three planes and one helicopter in the air. We are also reviewing satellite imagery and mobile phone data to see if they can be of any assistance in the search. So far today nothing spotted can be attributed to the missing plane.” The aircraft, carrying Sala and the pilot, disappeared off Alderney in the Channel Islands on Monday night.Sala reportedly sent a voicemail message to his father saying he was frightened the plane was about to break up.He was flying to Wales from the French city of Nantes after signing for Cardiff City for a club record fee of £13m.In a transcript of the call, quoted by the Mirror, he said: “I’m here on a plane that looks like it’s about to fall apart, and I’m going to Cardiff … If in an hour and a half you have no news from me, I don’t know if they are going to send someone to look for me because they cannot find me, but you know … Dad, how scared am I!”The search and rescue operation – which included help from the Channel Islands, UK and France – was suspended for the day at 5pm on Tuesday.The chances of finding Sala alive were “slim” if the plane landed on water, Guernsey police said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.According to Guernsey police, the Piper PA-46 Malibu, a single-turbine engine aircraft, departed Nantes at 7.15pm for the Welsh capital and was flying at an altitude of 5,000ft (1,500 metres).On passing Guernsey it “requested descent”, but Jersey air traffic control (ATC) lost contact with the plane while it was flying at 2,300ft.After a 15-hour search from rescue teams, which covered an area of 1,155 sq miles, Guernsey police said “a number of floating objects” were seen in the water, but they were “unable to confirm whether any of these are from the missing aircraft”.Earlier on Tuesday, Cardiff’s executive director, Ken Choo, expressed his shock and distress at the news.Sala, 28, was on his way back to Wales after saying goodbye to his Nantes teammates on Monday night. Choo described Sala as a “great person” and said he had been “so happy” to sign for Cardiff.Cardiff City’s chairman, Mehmet Dalman, told BBC Radio Wales the plane was not booked by the club.Dalman said: “We spoke to the player and asked him if he wanted us to make arrangements for his flight which, quite frankly, would have been commercial. He declined and made his own arrangements.“I can’t tell you who arranged the flight because I don’t know at this stage – but it certainly wasn’t Cardiff City.”He said Cardiff manager, Neil Warnock, was “in a state of shock”. He said: “Neil is human and he’s affected as much as we all are.“We need to get on and do the right things but at the moment there’s a vacuum of information – it’s very unsettling.“We’re still praying, we still have prayers and we’ve got to be doing that, we’ve got to make sure.“The reaction we’ve had and the reaction that I’ve seen from the football world and outside the football world has been really overwhelming.“I even had a text message from a prime minister of a country to wish us well. So the support we’re getting from the community, the football community, has been really overwhelming.“Cardiff City will be involved with the investigation. We won’t leave a single stone unturned until we have all the facts.”Dalman added: “It’s a tragedy that I have never faced before.

What’s behind the obsessive pursuit of a flawless look?People used to call Anika the Snap Queen. Between the ages of 19 and 21, she was “obsessed with Snapchat, to the point where I had 4,000 followers”. At the peak of her “tragic” behaviour, she reckons now – a year after quitting the image-sharing app – she was taking 25 selfies a day.She liked the sense of having a platform, she says, with the average selfie getting 300 replies. “It was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m so popular – I’ve gotta show my face.’” But the filters were also part of the appeal. The Londoner had long been insecure about the slight bump in her nose. Snapchat’s fun effects, which let you embellish your selfies with dog ears, flower crowns and the like, would also erase the bump entirely. “I’d think, ‘I’d like to look how I look with this filter that makes my nose look slimmer.’”Socialising in the real world, she would choose her seat to avoid being seen in profile. She recognises that this was irrational – “but it happens. I feel like we’re in a world where a lot of people are seen to be perfect, and so we try and reach that peak.”Sometimes her followers would suggest meeting in person. “Then it would be like, ‘I have to look like my selfie.’” It was around this time, the height of her Snapchat obsession, that Anika started contacting cosmetic doctors on Instagram.The phenomenon of people requesting procedures to resemble their digital image has been referred to – sometimes flippantly, sometimes as a harbinger of end times – as “Snapchat dysmorphia”. The term was coined by the cosmetic doctor Tijion Esho, founder of the Esho clinics in London and Newcastle. He had noticed that where patients had once brought in pictures of celebrities with their ideal nose or jaw, they were now pointing to photos of themselves.While some used their selfies – typically edited with Snapchat or the airbrushing app Facetune – as a guide, others would say, “‘I want to actually look like this’, with the large eyes and the pixel-perfect skin,” says Esho. “And that’s an unrealistic, unattainable thing.”A recent report in the US medical journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery suggested that filtered images’ “blurring the line of reality and fantasy” could be triggering body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental health condition where people become fixated on imagined defects in their appearance. Like Esho, Dr Wassim Taktouk uses non-surgical, non-permanent “injectables” such as Botox and dermal fillers to enlarge lips or smooth a bumpy nose. He recalls a client coming to see him in his cream-carpeted Kensington clinic, upset after a date made through an app had gone south. “When she’d met the man, he had been quite disparaging: ‘You don’t look anything like your picture.’”The woman showed Taktouk the heavily filtered image on her profile and said: “I want to look like that.” It was flawless, he says – “without a single marking of a normal human face”. He told her he couldn’t help. “If that’s the picture you’re going to put out of yourself, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment.”Why do we take so many photos of ourselves? A 2017 study into “selfitis”, as the obsessive taking of selfies has been called, found a range of motivations, from seeking social status to shaking off depressive thoughts and – of course – capturing a memorable moment. Another study suggested that selfies served “a private and internal purpose”, with the majority never shared with anyone or posted anywhere – terabytes, even petabytes of photographs never to be seen by anyone other than their subject.With so much of life now lived online, from dating to job-hunting, recent, quality images of yourself are also a necessity – it is no wonder that Facetune (Apple’s most popular paid-for app of 2017) and the free follow-up Facetune2 have more than 55m users between them. Stav Tishler of Lightricks, the company behind them, says making airbrushing accessible has challenged “that illusion that ‘a perfect body’ exists … and levelled out the playing field”: “Everyone knows everyone is using it, supermodels and ‘everyday’ people alike.”Even novelty filters such as Snapchat and Instagram’s, as well as adding bunny ears or specs to your selfie, plump your lips, erase your pores and lift your jowls while they are at it. (Snapchat declined to respond on the record.)The filtered-selfie look is also reflected in demand for bigger lips and taut jawlines. Such so-called “tweakments” have exploded in recent years, thanks to their relative affordability and convenience. A “liquid nose job” using fillers might cost a few hundred pounds and takes instant effect, compared with the slow, painful recovery from a surgical rhinoplasty. Marla, 29, from New York, got her “perfect nose” last year while on her lunch break. “I went back to work feeling just so much more polished and confident – like I was even writing my emails better.”Like Anika, she had always been bothered by the bump in her nose, religiously removing it from selfies but she began exploring real-world options after a painful breakup. A list of pros and cons revealed that the potential risks – of her parents’ disapproval and “necrosis of the face” (“It’s very rare, but it’s definitely a thing”) – did not outweigh the benefits of having “the nose I create for myself on Facetune”.The rise of fillers – anything from collagen and hyaluronic acid, which break down in a matter of months, to the permanent but riskier polymethyl methacrylate beads – has been accelerated by celebrity endorsements from the likes of the Kardashian clan. The removal and subsequent return of Kylie Jenner’s lip fillers have been followed with particular interest. ) Some doctors try to capitalise on this with “the Kylie package” for nose, jaw and lips, says Taktouk, disapprovingly. Ten years ago, his clients were deeply concerned with patient confidentiality “Now, it’s ‘Do you mind if I Insta-story this?’ It’s not taboo any more.” He has seen lips advertised for £150 and noses for £200-£300. “And that’s one of the trickiest procedures of the lot.”Fillers may be less invasive than surgery, but they are not without their risks, which range from uneven results and infection to vascular blockages and even blindness. Save Face, the UK’s largest register of accredited practitioners of non-surgical treatments, says almost 1,000 complaints were made in the year to October. Yet there is little regulation and no minimum age. “We have more protections for houses than we do children’s faces,” says Esho, who has campaigned for crackdowns. “It’s crazy.”Even Marla – who documented her follow-up nose job in a short film for Vice, and does paid promotional work for cosmetic surgeons – says she would not encourage a young girl to do as she did. “I know that I love myself – that’s why I let myself get little tweaks – but it would really bother me if a young girl told me that she didn’t.”The process is as easy as “click-click-click, look at 10 bits of his work in the space of a minute, wow, let’s contact him”, says Anika. At the age of 20, she turned up at Taktouk’s clinic with photos of noses he had done and a video of herself with a Snapchat filter. “You know the one that kind of makes your face look like an alien’s? I was like, ‘This looks great – my nose looks so much smaller.’ Dr Taktouk was like: ‘This is not what is going to happen with filler.’” She laughs. “He told me to come back with my mum.”Instead, Anika took a year out to consider her decision, weighing up fillers’ merits against surgical rhinoplasty. “Actually, I went through a phase of thinking, ‘No, I should try and love myself.’” How did that go? “I didn’t do rhinoplasty,” she says drily. “I guess that’s as far as I got.” By the time she returned to Taktouk’s clinic, aged 21, she had been brought “back down to earth”. He injected filler into the tip of her nose, evening out its line. She loved it instantly. “I feel like I just needed that to change me inside, so I could stop looking for perfection.”When the filler eventually breaks down after about a year, she will repeat the procedure. “The most beautiful thing is when someone is happy from within,” she says “as ironic as it sounds”, her new nose helped her to attain it. “I’m not itching to get anything else.”There was a moment just after the procedure, though, as she was admiring her new profile, when she wondered aloud if her lips needed filling, too. They were one of her most prominent features she had been called Fish Lips at school. Taktouk told her to stop being silly. “When you’re in that seat, it’s quite tempting,” she says. “Like, ‘What else can I do?’”It prompts the question: which are you trying to correct, the image or the reality?Anna, 40, from Malvern – another patient of Taktouk’s – admits to having once been “fixated” on her laugh lines. “The photos exacerbate it, making it look worse, then a filter can make it look amazing. You’re unsure of what you look like.”Ever since she was young, she has struggled with the discrepancy between how she sees herself in the mirror, and how others see her. Once, she downloaded an app that claimed “to show you how you really look”. “It used to horrify me, and make me feel terrible about myself. But these are conversations you can’t really have, because you do sound self-absorbed and you’re leaving yourself vulnerable.”She is more self-confident now, which she attributes both to age and the occasional self-esteem boost of Botox or filler. “I’m quite realistic now, whereas in the past I’ve driven myself crazy.”For Taktouk, referrals from social media make it harder to safeguard patients’ mental health. His background as a GP has helped him to spot red flags, such as badmouthing other doctors, insisting on flaws that aren’t there, and in-depth knowledge of treatments: “I’ve had someone come in here and draw the lines on their face themselves.” But, he adds, “I’m sure some will have slipped past without me realising” – and even if Taktouk refuses to treat them, someone else will.Over the weekend it was reported that Superdrug (which began offering Botox late last year) has agreed to introduce mental health screening for people seeking Botox, following criticism from the NHS for not conducting “medically responsible” checks. Taktouk says far more industry-wide regulation is needed, before there is a headline-grabbing tragedy and apps become even more transformative. He points to one called Retouch Me, which superimposes six-packs on to swimsuit pictures. “I saw it and thought, this is the new wave of what we’re going to get in: ‘Make me look like this.’”The onset tends to occur in adolescence, though people with the condition may not seek help until 10 years later. The general rule, says Professor David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley hospital in south London, is that you can “think about your appearance for an hour a day before it becomes a disorder” – but for a diagnosis, it must be accompanied by significant distress or inability to function normally. People with BDD take selfies because they are convinced “that they are hideous”.In 2014, then 19-year-old Danny Bowman from Northumberland was reported to be “Britain’s first selfie addict” after being interviewed about his experience of BDD. His problems had begun four years before, when he was rejected by a modelling agency at the same time as he was being bullied at his new school and on Facebook. “For me, it was confirmation that I did look ugly.”Bowman was soon spending hours before the mirror, slathering himself in acne cream and moisturiser and monitoring a steady stream of selfies for real-time improvement. After three months he dropped out of school, and the selfie-taking increased to hundreds a day. “I was trying to see some gradual improvement, and take that photo that I was pleased with. I was just trying to get that relief, and I couldn’t get it. There wasn’t a perfect photo. There isn’t a perfect photo.”After six months of being housebound, consumed by his daily rituals, he tried to kill himself. “A lot of people say looking at themselves in the mirror probably makes them feel insecure, but imagine scanning through 200 pictures a day. I was just exhausted. I felt like there was no way out.” His mother – like his father, a mental health professional – found him in time and he was diagnosed with BDD. Part of his 12-week treatment involved restricting access to his phone.Now 24, Bowman is studying at the University of York and campaigns on issues related to mental health and positive body image. He has raised concerns about the impact of Instagram with friends he sees “posting photographs of themselves every other day, Facetuning themselves, making themselves look unlike the way they look. That was me, but on an amplified scale.” They have reacted defensively, he says. “It has become such a normal thing that people don’t see what they’re doing as abnormal.”He very rarely takes selfies now. “I just don’t feel the need to do it.”• The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation can be found at bddfoundation.org "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0883c5f62229217aa4c00d93cb2bfc3142fff0f4/23_936_3638_2183/master/3638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f5a993080cb8b5144219ebb7e7fd394","title":"celebrity social media influencers pledge to change way they post","story":"Clampdown on stars being paid for endorsing products without disclosing firm rewards themMore than a dozen celebrities, including Alexa Chung and Ellie Goulding, have pledged to change the way they label social media posts after Britain’s competition watchdog clamped down on the practice of stars being paid for endorsing products without disclosing they were being rewarded by the company.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had secured formal commitments from 16 celebrities to state clearly if they have been paid or received any gifts or loans of products that they endorse.The celebrities, with millions of followers on social media, include the singers Goulding and Rita Ora, the models Chung and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the former Coronation Street and Our Girl actor Michelle Keegan, the former Towie actor Mario Falcone, the model James Chapman (known for his men’s fashion YouTube channel), and the TV reality stars Millie Mackintosh and Megan McKenna.Online endorsements from celebrities or bloggers can help brands boost sales as fans follow their social media channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear or eat and which products they use. Social media influencers can earn tens of thousands of pounds from companies for a single post.However, where they are paid or rewarded to promote a product in their social media feeds, consumer protection law requires them to disclose this. If they don’t, they can be prosecuted by the CMA and fines could then be imposed. Breaking a court order could lead to two years in prison. The watchdog has published a guide for influencers.The CMA’s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: “Influencers can have a huge impact on what their fans decide to buy. People could, quite rightly, feel misled if what they thought was a recommendation from someone they admired turns out to be a marketing ploy.“You should be able to tell as soon as you look at a post if there is some form of payment or reward involved, so you can decide whether something is really worth spending your hard-earned money on.”Warning letters have been sent to a number of other celebrities and influencers, as well as 70 advertising and PR agencies, since the CMA began its investigation in August. It hopes the 16 celebrities who have given formal commitments will lead by example and that others will follow suit. All of them co-operated with the CMA and volunteered to make changes to their practices.Some high-profile influencers use the hashtag #ad on social media to disclose when they have been paid to post about a product. But the CMA concluded that was not enough as it could be buried among other hashtags and said a commercial relationship must be clearly declared in the post.The watchdog said three out of five people it had interviewed said they had been influenced by celebrities.The London-based fashion label Kitri sold out of its £145 Gabriella dress in less than an hour after a fashion blogger posted a picture of it on Instagram.The CMA said it would investigate further to look at the role and responsibilities of social media platforms. The Advertising Standards Authority is also investigating after a surge in the number of complaints."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9c95c4754f8a47c3a952a9e79b38ac3d36a0e7/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfabe3bf4882ccbf35705f2ebad2b0d","title":"goldcar hire car insurance policy cost keys","story":"I used Expedia to book a flight to Spain and a car rental with Goldcar.Since the insurance included in rental is minimal, I bought a fully comprehensive policy from a third-party company. At the Goldcar desk at Almeira airport, I was told I must pay extra, including a premium for its insurance policy. I repeatedly showed her the insurance policy I had, but she insisted she could not hand over the keys until I’d bought Goldcar’s. I was worried we’d be stranded, so paid the €261.40 premium. I complained to Expedia but it eventually told me it could not help.Here’s a tip: Google any businesses you plan to spend money with. If you had, you would see your experience is echoed by many others.The Spanish company, which has become part of Europcar, is notorious for insisting customers buy its comprehensive insurance policy on top of the basic insurance included – or else forfeit the rental.Some of those who have contacted the Observer in the past claim insurance was never mentioned – they were simply asked to sign a document in Spanish in return for the keys and only found out they had been charged for an unwanted policy when their bank statement came through. The only insurance legally required for drivers is a collision damage waiver, third-party cover and theft protection, all of which were in the Expedia quote.If, to avoid a hefty excess, customers choose to pay extra for fully comprehensive insurance from another company, car hire firms should usually accept this, although they may ringfence a sum on your credit card if the policy proves inadequate.You, like others, were required to sign paperwork in Spanish, which included an airport surcharge. Even if you had been able to translate them, terms like “super relax cover”, “mega relax cover” and “smart fuel return option” would make little more sense.Goldcar ignored three requests for a comment. Expedia told us: “Policies differ between each provider, so it is important to double-check the rules and restrictions page, which states the services included in the rate you have chosen. Third-party insurance in specific circumstances may not be eligible, so always call the provider and check the rules before travelling.”Expedia declined to answer whether it was comfortable doing business with a company with such a track record, but, significantly, has decided to refund the €261.50 charge as “a goodwill gesture”.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

But it is the smaller details that visitors to the 25 in Torquay tend to comment on: the personal greeting at the door on arrival, the handwritten notes of welcome in the rooms, Andy’s baked goodies that await after a hard day’s sightseeing.Though the B\u0026ampB – newly crowned the world’s best – is closed at the moment for a winter break, the couple were there on Tuesday getting ready for their first visitors of 2019, who will arrive next month. Andy was busy preparing beds while Julian was up a ladder dusting light fittings.They received news of their accolade towards the end of a rather trying redecorating session. “It hadn’t been a brilliant day,” said Andy. “It was a pretty big shock. We had to sit down.”No 25 Avenue Road is an Edwardian building a few minutes’ walk from the waterfront. When they took it over, it had 10 bedrooms. They knocked walls down and added others in to create six larger, much more luxurious rooms. They thought carefully about the position of every plug socket, every light, every bin. One of their own bugbears when they visited another hotel or B\u0026ampB, they said, was that teabag-dripping walk from the kettle to the waste basket.If they were shocked at the recognition, their customers weren’t. “Not a surprise at all,” said Simon Bexx, a company director who has visited three times with his wife, Jenny. “I was at a big hotel in Mayfair recently but The 25 was better than that. It’s spotless, they couldn’t do more for you. The attention to detail is just amazing.”Online reviews are just as positive. One contented visitor, Emily Jenkins, said she had asked if there was a different kind of pillow available and was impressed when Andy produced not one alternative but an “array” for her to choose from.Other happy guests rave about features ranging from the heated bathroom mirrors that do not mist up to the online tutorial for the whizzy coffee machines.Not quite anyone is welcome, however. The B\u0026ampB is for adults only and just one pet is allowed: Andy and Julian’s dog, a miniature schnauzer called Patsy.The Banner-Prices arrived on the English Riviera after spending seven years running a successful country house hotel in north Wales. They fell in love with the feel of The 25 and were not put off by the association of Torquay with the sitcom Fawlty Towers or by outdated notions of what a B\u0026ampB is.Andy said he had always enjoyed John Cleese and Connie Booth’s BBC sitcom and the pair relished showing visitors that English seaside B\u0026ampBs were not all about paper-thin walls and strict curfews. “We love to convert people to the idea of the B\u0026ampB,” he said.

The payment is in addition to the interchange rate.There are more than 50,000 free-to-use ATMs across the UK, but the vast majority will not be eligible for the super premiums.Currently, about 3,500 ATMs are protected because they are half a mile or more from the next nearest free cash machine, or are located in low-income parts of the country, as measured by official data, where access to cash is vital. These ATMs were ringfenced from the changes to interchange rates.John Howells, Link’s chief executive, said: “These premiums will further safeguard ATMs in remote and less well-off areas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5454a7326e4be674d7f5b3a1f3597487eb14845f/0_0_6201_3721/master/6201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5badd136ce9fa5f41ad82d2affe1a58a","title":"aya nakamura interview french afropop reluctant face of empowerment","story":"Her songs have been hailed as anthems against sexual violence, but the French star insists she has more personal goals in sightWith its sweet melody over a beat made for couples’ dancing, Aya Nakamura’s track Djadja sounds, to anglophone ears, like a love song. With the video fast approaching 300m views on YouTube, this catchy afropop song made Nakamura’s the queen of the French urban music scene last year. But while the 23-year-old’s voice playfully switches between singing and soft rap, the bittersweet track finds Nakamura calling out a guy who has been lying about having sex with her. “You think about me while I think about making money,” she sings (in French), witheringly. “I’m not your mother  I’m not going to lecture you.”The song has been hailed as an anthem for female empowerment and taken on a life of its own: Nakamura’s image was used on posters during recent French protests confronting violence against women. Yet the singer is equivocal about the reaction. “It’s cool to be able to represent black women in France,” she says, “but I have my own way of being, my own way of doing things. There’s a problem when people say, ‘You’re the only black woman representing’ – there are others too.”Recently there has been a buzz around French artists breaking into foreign markets, including PNL, the Blaze and Christine and the Queens, but Aya represents something different. Determined and suburban, she talks about making money and dominating men much like Rihanna or Cardi B would. And unlike other French women who have come close to breaking international markets, she is not white, Arab or mixed race. She’s a black woman in an industry known to discriminate in favour of lighter-skinned artists. “Colourism exists in some way everywhere,” she says. “It’s really difficult when there are people trying to pressure you into bleaching your skin, because that’s what they want. You ask yourself: where are we? Why should I do that? This is how I am.”She adds that an idealised image of the all-powerful black woman isn’t helpful. She recently refused a selfie with a fan in Senegal because she was tired from a flight. Media and fans branded her a snob. “People have this image of the black woman who can face anything, but we are just like everyone else.”In fact Nakamura’s appeal lies partly in her demand for that kind of respect – in her song Copines, she shames a guy who has been checking out her friends – and in her music she doesn’t pretend to be approachable. She seems unfazed by the attention resulting from Djadja. “My concept isn’t about making everyone happy,” she says. “When I’m in the studio it’s about what I like ... I don’t worry about everyone getting what I’m saying.”While she appeals to the frustrations that some listeners may share about men, Nakamura also has a softer side. Last month, she released a song called La Dot, about falling for a guy, getting a dowry and wanting “the dream life”. This might seem at odds with some people’s vision of female empowerment, but as a young French Malian woman, Nakamura has her own vision of fairytale romance that speaks to a generation of young women from north and west African backgrounds in France. It takes strong sense of autonomy and self-respect and mixes it with traditional values passed on from older generations.Born Aya Danioko in Mali – Nakamura was adopted as a stage name, inspired by a character from superhero drama Heroes – she came to live in Aulnay-sous-Bois in the suburbs of Paris with her family when she was a baby. Her mother was a griotte, a traditional Malian poet or singer. “If you come from a line of griots you’re automatically categorised by that,” she says. “They tell people’s stories in the villages, and basically performed the role of the media for previous generations.”In her house, uncles and aunts played a big role in teaching the younger ones about Malian culture. Did these women influence the no-nonsense attitude in her music? “No, that was me,” she says. “I’ve always had quite a strong character, ever since I was little.” She is interrupted by her two-year-old daughter. “It’s like having two jobs,” she says of her life as a parent and a rising star. “I work with my family it’s very complicated but it’s OK.”Nakamura pushes back on the suggestion that she is continuing the griot tradition, clarifying that what she does is a little different. Her song about Grammy-award winning Malian singer Oumou Sangaré pays homage to a woman who she grew up admiring, and Sangaré features in the video for the track. “She’s a singer, a businesswoman and she really represents Malian women,” she says passionately. “I really went into fan mode when I met her – she was so beautiful and she really got what I was doing.”Her success over the past year may have pushed her into the spotlight and exposed her to pressure to meet others’ expectations, but Nakamura is adamant that her motivation lies closer to home: “I really want to show my daughter my story and let her know who we are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

He devoted all his questions to Brexit, and mostly focused on challenging May to rule out no deal, and to accept the case for the UK staying in a customs union. On the latter point, May was reasonably clear, restating her opposition to a CU on the grounds that it would not allow the UK to strike its own trade deals. On no deal, she was more evasive. Corbyn asked at one point if she would accept the amendments tabled ahead of next week’s vote, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit, if they are passed. This is a crucial question, because it is not clear that the amendments will actually have the impact the MPs who have tabled them hope, and May did not address this point at all, beyond saying that extending article 50 does not absolutely rule out no deal because it only postpones the decision point. The point Corbyn made at the end about May ruling out the two propositions for which there is majority support in the Commons was a strong one. But it was not a clear-cut win for him. Predictably, but not entirely unfairly, May clobbered him in her first response for his decision to boycott her cross-party talks on Brexit by imposing a precondition. (Many people have said he would have been better advised to just turn up, and denounce her inflexibility afterwards.) May also had a good riff about technical aspects of Labour’s CU policy which the party has not been able to address. This attack line was well-founded too. But, overall, she came over as harsh and defensive, confirming the jibe Corbyn made about her having an open door but a closed mind. This was probably the best soundbite of the exchange. It was not actually Corbyn’s at all, because Hilary Benn first used this line in the Commons on Monday, but so what? Most viewers won’t have realised, and it worked.Corbyn says Liam Fox could not name one country he has reached a trade deal with. He will sell jobs down the river. Why?May says she wants a deal that protects jobs. She says Corbyn stands up and delivers phrases. But he does not know what those phrases mean, she says. And Corbyn has not mentioned the employment figures.Corbyn says May has not mentioned poverty. The door may be open, but minds are closed, he says. He says a third of her government are at the billionaires’ jamboree at Davos. He says May has ruled out the two issues on which there is a majority in Commons – ruling out no deal and a customs union.May asks why Corbyn won’t come and talk about it. She says borrowing is at its lowest level for 16 years, the IMF is predicting higher growth than for some other big economies, and the biggest threat to that would be a Labour government. Corbyn says a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs and undermine living standards. Is her government ruling out a customs union with the EU?May says Labour has an amendment on this. But what does Labour mean by staying in the customs union? She rattles off a series of questions, and says she would like to talk to Corbyn about it. If he won’t talk about it, he has not got a clue.Corbyn says it is a simple question. The TUC backs his policy, she says, and the CBI, and the first minsters of Wales and Scotland. Can May explain why she is ruling it out? She could, for once, answer the question.May says she will try to help. She says when people talk about it, they want businesses to be able to export to the EU without facing tariffs or rules-of-origin checks. Her deal allows that, but also allows the UK to strike its own trade deals.Jeremy Corbyn starts by also mentioning Holocaust Memorial Day, and condemning antisemitism and racism.He says the chancellor and the business secretary say there is a large majority in the Commons against no deal. So will she take it off the table?May says the way to avoid no deal is to pass a deal. She says she wants to sit down and talk about how to secure support for a deal. Corbyn has been willing to sit down with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA without pre-conditions. But he won’t sit down with May. In this case, he is neither present nor involved.Corbyn says he did offer to meet May last autumn. While May’s door may be open, her mind is closed. Will May confirm that, if the anti no-deal amendments are passed, they will rule out no deal.May says the amendments do not solve the issue, because they just delay Brexit.Stephen Kerr, a Conservative, says the UK is the most successful political union that the world has ever known. When Nicola Sturgeon demands a second independence referendum, the UK government should say no, he says.May agrees. People in Scotland voted to stay in the UK. And at the last general election people indicated that they opposed a second referendum. A second referendum is “the last thing we want”, she says.Theresa May starts by saying MPs will want to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Sunday. It is a reminder we must all challenge prejudice and hatred, she says.From the Times’ Patrick KiddHere is the list of MPs down to ask a question.The Irish border backstop would constrain the UK’s negotiating position during post-separation trade talks, a pro-Brexit legal expert said. As the Press Association reports, Martin Howe QC, who chairs Lawyers for Britain, said there would be no incentive for the EU to make concessions if the backstop was the default. Giving evidence to the Northern Ireland affairs committee, he said:You cannot hold out for your essential interests. If you fail to reach agreement these terms come into effect, that constrains your negotiating power. Why should the other side give you better terms unless you are able to offer them something else in return that is better for them?ITV’s political editor Robert Peston has written an interesting Facebook post about Jacob Rees-Mogg’s speech later today. (See 10am.) He sees it as evidence that Brexiters are “panicking that a referendum and staying in the EU will soon become the default position”.” But he is not convinced that a degree of flexibility from the ERG means a deal with the EU will be possible. He says:So although the PM will take considerable comfort from the moves by Mogg and the DUP to tone down their rhetoric against the broader tapestry of her deal (which of course still repels them), she will need much more from them if the EU27 leaders are to make the kind of compromise which all history suggests they will never make.It is that requisite very public endorsement by Mogg of May and the iteration of Brexit he despises that, to put it mildly, stretches credibility. Have stranger things ever happened?Incidentally, what the “senior official” from an EU capital quoted by Peston says about the need for Theresa May to have a “large and stable” majority to get Brexit legislation through parliament sounds very similar to what Michel Barnier was saying in his Luxembourg Times interview. (See 10.50am.)In evidence to the Commons justice committee, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, explained why he thought the publication of his legal advice on the Brexit backstop before Christmas should not be allowed to set a precedent for the future. Asked if it should, he replied:If every time the attorney general now has to consider whether or not his advice is going to be put up on a 24-hour rolling news programme and pulled apart in a 45-second analysis – without the nuance, without the context, without the bits that weren’t in bold, and only those bits in bold accentuated – he is going to have to consider how does he express himself in future ...The attorney by definition tends only to give advice in exceptional circumstances and the more exquisitely sensitive and controversial they are, it is even more important that his advice should be able to be candid and frank and targeted. Sitting in cabinet ... he knows the issues with which his colleagues are struggling, he knows those which have to be accentuated and emphasised to drive home the point and he knows those points which are not necessarily so important. That particularly focused and targeted advice on the need of the moment will sometimes be given in a manner – because it is designed for that moment – that at another time, where there are different priorities and different understandings, he might have expressed himself differently.This morning the  reports on British fishermen’s anxieties about direct action from France in the event of a no deal Brexit: the fishing community is becoming increasingly concerned that blockades by French crew, angry at no longer being able to fish in UK waters, could leave their catch rotting at the border.These concerns would seem to be bolstered by an interview with Olivier Lepretre, a Boulogne trawler skipper who is vice-president of France’s CNPMEM fishermen’s committee. He says that French fishermen will have nothing to lose by taking action, warning: “Not a single kilo of seafood from Britain will be allowed into Europe.”He tells the Fisker Forum, an online fishing news service for the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia: If we are sacrificed to Brexit, then we have nothing left to lose. We will get rid of every British flagged vessel, regardless of its ownership. That’ll be hard luck for the opportunists.It’s hard to gauge just how damaging direct action in France could be. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, told the  that he believed any protests would be short-lived, but Elaine Whyte, who represents smaller fishing operations on the Clyde, warned that she feared some would go to the wall if live catch was not able to make to its EU destination. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has given an intriguing interview to the Luxembourg Times. Here are the main points.If the UK government wants to be more ambitious in its future relationship which is not part of the withdrawal agreement, we can do so, and then come to an agreement on the entire package. That would make the question of the backstop less prominent.Looking at it objectively, I have the impression that the backstop is not the central issue. Ultimately, the debate in Britain is about what the future of the UK will look like. I believe that we can overcome the current difficulties when we discuss that issue together.He also claimed there was a “readiness in London” for this sort of approach (although it is not clear if, by “London”, he meant the government or parliament). He said:We’re cooperating with the British government. Things could start moving rapidly. This depends on the future relationship, like I already said. We are ready to be more ambitious if the British decide to shift their red lines, for example by remaining in a customs union, or participating in the single market. I believe there is a readiness in London for that.If Britain asks for an extension, it has to be approved by EU leaders. They will only agree if three questions are answered: first and second, why and how long? And third, will not that be a problem for holding the EU elections in May? I have no clear legal answer to the third question yet. It is important that the EU’s democratic processes are not disturbed by this, however.The first two questions are complex and interconnected: it needs a stable majority in London for all laws related to Brexit that need to be adopted. This will need time.There will be checks in case of a no-deal-Brexit. We will do everything possible to enforce them unobtrusively. However, that will not be possible with everything. How should we control animals crossing the border? There will have to be checks. Again, the problem arose from Brexit and we expect the UK to take responsibility.The backstop is like an insurance. It is not there to be used. And if so, only provisionally. However, we cannot tie the backstop to a time limit.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, seems to be implying in the speech is he giving to today that the EU may be willing to compromise over the backstop. (See 10am.) Barnier’s interview suggests otherwise.This is a pan-European problem because it is to do with the integrity of the European single market. A product that enters the market in Northern Ireland and then Ireland will find itself in the European market and could continue to travel to Luxembourg. Here we have an obligation to protect European consumers and businesses and therefore we have to control these goods.Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon is meeting Theresa May, along with the Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford, later today for further Brexit talks, but it’s fair to say that no one is expecting the conversation to be particularly constructive.In advance of the meeting, Sturgeon warned May to “stop blaming everybody else” for the worse political crisis in decades, and “start listening”.The Scottish government has consistently complained that its opinion has been sidelined in Brexit-related talks over the past three years, although May insisted on Monday that devolved administrations would now be more closely involved in discussions. SNP MPs have been involved in cross-party attempts to block a no-deal scenario.Meanwhile, Sturgeon said that she would urge May to extend article 50 and consider a second referendum. She said:Theresa May’s current strategy is to rule out the possible – extending the article 50 period – while pursuing the impossible – changes to the backstop. At today’s meeting I will be making clear to the prime minister that it is she who needs to change her position – not everybody else.The time has come for the Brexit clock to be stopped, through a formal extension of article 50 to allow a second referendum on EU membership to be held. We simply cannot afford to be dragged any closer to the cliff edge of No-deal – an outcome which should now be explicitly and definitively ruled out.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter who chairs the European Research Group, is giving a speech at lunchtime, and it sounds as if it is going to be significant. The ERG represents the 60-odd Tories most committed to a harder Brexit and it has led the opposition to Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Rees-Mogg celebrated the defeat of May’s deal by hosting a champagne reception and ERG members regularly argue that they would be happy to see the UK leave without a deal. But now, according to a briefing from the speech sent out to journalists in advance, Rees-Mogg will say the backstop is the only “absolute obstacle” to a deal (in the past the ERG has highlighted many other objections to it), and he will suggest that he and his fellow Brexiters are in a mood to compromise.Rees-Mogg will say:There are outbreaks of realism all around I see.All along we have been asking merely for the possible, not the impossible. And late in the day as the EU has inevitably left it, I’m sure common sense and practicality will now prevail.The backstop doesn’t work for unionists in the Tory party, or the DUP. The pretence that we might ever swallow it is now over.It’s long past time to get on and just do the feasible deal that has always been there to do.(These words were supposed to be released under embargo, but the press notice sent to journalists did not make this particularly clear, and others have posted them on Twitter, and so I am putting them up now.)Without having read the full speech, it is hard to know quite how real this shift it, but it could be evidence that the prospect of Brexit being blocked by the Commons has made Tory Brexiters more eager to support a deal that makes it happen. Nadine Dorries, another Tory Brexiter, made this argument in a Newsnight interview on Monday.The next big parliamentary vote on Brexit comes next week and last night there was good news for those who want to amend the government motion to force the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit. There are various amendments on the order paper designed to do this, and one of the main ones has been tabled by Labour’s Yvette Cooper. It would create time for MPs to debate her bill (pdf) saying Theresa May would have to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of the year if MPs have not approved a Brexit deal by 26 February. On Newsnight last night John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, all but announced that Labour will support the Cooper amendment. He said it was a “sensible proposal” and that it was “increasingly likely” that Labour would vote for it. Assuming the amendment gets called, given the number of rebel Tories in favour, this means it is highly likely to pass.You can read the Cooper amendment, and all the others, on the order paper (pdf), staring from page 49. My colleague Jessica Elgot has written a good guide to what they all mean here.But would the Cooper amendment actually stop a no-deal Brexit if it were passed? On the Today programme, Liam Fox, the Brexiter international trade secretary, claimed that it would not. He claimed that it was constitutionally improper. But he also claimed it would not work. Asked about it, he said:We have an arrangement in our country where the executive - ie, the government of the day - puts forward legislation, parliament scrutinises it, parliament amends it, parliament can decide to pass it or not pass it. What is being suggested here is the House of Commons both initiates the legislation and scrutinises it, which is a huge change to our constitution. And the danger here is, you change our constitutional conventions for one reason, but it has huge consequences elsewhere. And in effect, in this motion, we are being asked to change it without any real debate about the constitutional significance.(In fact, parliament regularly debates and passes legislation proposed by backbenchers - there is a formal procedure for this - but never mind ...)As the interviewer, Nick Robinson, pointed out, Fox’s argument bluntly contradicted what Philip Hammond, the chancellor, told business leaders in a conference call last week after MPs voted down Theresa May’s deal. Hammond urged them not to worry too much about a no-deal Brexit happening because MPs would block it. “I can simply as a parliamentarian say it is clear to me there is a large majority in the Commons that is opposed to no deal in any circumstances,” Hammond said.In his interview, when it was put to him that even May admits a no-deal Brexit would be very bad for the UK, Fox claimed it would be better than delaying Brexit. He explained:I think there are many who talk about delaying Brexit when what they really mean is not having Brexit at all. And I think the worst outcome in this political process would be for parliament, having given a guarantee to the voters that they would honour the result of the referendum, to turn round and break that contract with the voters ...I think the most dangerous thing for Britain, politically, is for Brexit to be denied to the British people when they were specifically promised it. I think it would open up a gulf of trust between parliament and the people that might be difficult to repair, and with unknowable consequences.Here is the agenda for the day.10am: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee.12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.1pm: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, gives a speech to the Bruges Group.4pm: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit.

And how long I would have to be left for it definitely to work. It wasn’t even like I was really upset about it. I just felt numb.After suffering a panic attack at a friend’s house, Pendleton sought help. She also turned to former British Cycling psychiatrist, Steve Peters, who she telephoned during her darkest moment.“It must have been about 6.30am,” she said. “I had been awake for hours. I remember lying there with tears rolling down the side of my face. Not really crying, but just feeling a sense of hopelessness. I was so low. So helpless.Pendleton moved in with her mother in Hertfordshire for a time and a subsequent holiday in France made her feel she had “turned a corner”, before she embarked on a surfing trip to Costa Rica.“I guess it was a very unconventional thing to do,” she added. “It was against the recommendation of my family and almost everyone else. They were like ‘you’re going to travel by yourself. Be on your own. If you feel bad who is going to be there for you?’In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Inevitable. This is simply how stuff works. I’m only sorry our denuded empire means Nick can’t be given an Indian province or something. Or at least a go on Malaya.The ways Timothy’s latest appointment were inevitable are many and various, and we’ll come to them shortly. But we must begin with a recap of how we got here. Because, of course, Nick wasn’t always the crayonner of red lines, the taxer of dementia, the shitter of the electoral bed. And, in one potential timeline, the parliamentary-maths-destroyer that ends up causing no-deal Brexit.Not really that long ago in the scheme of things, Nick was Theresa May’s special adviser in the home office, where they ran the hostile environment policy that led to the Windrush scandal. In the 2016 EU referendum campaign, he was an avowed leaver. Who knows whether it was his counsel that caused Theresa May to refuse to meaningfully surface to fight for Remain, to the point where frustrated campaign coordinators nicknamed her “Submarine May”. But fortuitously, Nick would soon be in No 10 as her joint chief of staff, where he squandered the height of May’s powers to entrench ision rather than heal it, by writing her 2016 conference Citizens of Nowhere speech.Within months, Article 50 was triggered, apparently without May having a clue what she wanted, let alone the cabinet, followed by Timothy shaping the red lines which have so hamstrung her during the Brexit negotiations. He pushed her to call an election, where his dementia tax turned out to be a six-pointer. For Labour.Having resigned after the majority was lost, Nick’s spell in the political wilderness lasted a full seven weeks, during which he devoted himself to helping the communities his balls-up might reasonably be expected to do over. No, wait – I’ve just checked, and apparently he went on his holibobs instead. On his return, he landed two national newspaper columns: one in the  (initially run under the auto-savaging banner “Ways To Win”), and one in the Sun. Despite these platforms, people began to notice a thing about Nick, which was that he was completely, sensationally, historically unable to acknowledge his role in the political shitstorm that was beginning to engulf the UK.So that’s the potted history. And I think you can see that Nick Timothy was, obviously, absolutely destined to pop up in the blazer class of British sport in due course. When asked about his qualifications, I hope he just looked at the appointments panel and went: “Turn on the rolling news.” And as they stared at the 24-hour Brexit crisis, Nick whooped: “THAT’s my CV, baby!”But the latter is just a fantasy sequence, obviously. We know how government (and sports governance) appointments work. The key question at times like this is: “Now, do we know anyone like us, but who’s from … hang on, where is it again? … Ah yes, ‘Birmingham’” But of course! There’s Nick Timothy. Blah-blah clever guy. Blah-blah could-do-something-interesting.”As for any previous pronouncements on sport Nick may have made, an archive trawl throws up the odd delight, such as: “I am not altogether comfortable with our participation in the Ryder Cup team.” He is at least a genuine Aston Villa fan, unlike David Cameron, who I once saw patronise some electrical apprentices with a suffering-fan joke about his club one day winning “the cup”. “Well, I can dream, can’t I?” he grinned ruefully, clearly unaware that Villa were in the FA Cup semi-finals at the time, and within a fortnight would have gone through to the final.The following year, alas, Villa were relegated, and Nick used that moment to pen his most far-reaching sporting thesis to date. “Their lack of commitment on the pitch has been matched only by their arrogance off it,” he observed. High praise. Nick went on to lambast the Villa players for not “showing contrition for their role in the club’s demise”. If the retrospective irony of that were not already too sledgehammer, he then inquired rhetorically: “So what can this sorry story teach us about politics?”Tell us when you find out, buddy. The real politicssports governance lesson is that both are mostly chumocracies which find jobs for chaps who have repeatedly proved their inadequacies. Like a certain type of manager or useless administrator, Timothy will spend the rest of his career walking into positions that attempt to “harness his talents” or “speak to his skillset”. These sort of characters are somehow judged too big to fail.When I heard the news of Timothy’s Commonwealth Games gig, I immediately began anticipating his 2023 self-exculpatory newspaper columns, in which he explained some notional administration cock-up.

No two-year-old has been given a higher mark since Xaar in 1997.Frankel was joint-top in the ratings eight years ago, alongside Dream Ahead, but Too Darn Hot is 5lb clear of Charlie Appleby’s Quorto, with the Middle Park Stakes winner, Ten Sovereigns, from the Aidan O’Brien stable in Ireland, another pound further back on 120 Michael Bell’s Pretty Pollyanna, on 116, is last season’s top-rated juvenile filly.Too Darn Hot completed an unbeaten four-race season with an authoritative performance in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket, where he beat Advertise (119) and Anthony Van Dyck (118) by two-and-three-quarter lengths and one-and-a-quarter. His victory followed a win in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in which he showed an outstanding turn of foot to make several lengths on his field in the penultimate furlong having become slightly detached from the leaders.Last season’s two-year-olds were seen as an above-average crop at the time and the classification is a triumph for Dubawi, the Darley Stud operation’s leading stallion, who sired both Too Darn Hot and Quorto.Too Darn Hot is only the second champion juvenile of Gosden’s long career, following on from Oasis Dream in 2002. He is a 6-4 chance to win the 2,000 Guineas in May and top-priced at 4-1 for the Derby over a mile-and-a-half in June, despite his trainer expressing doubts about his stamina beyond a mile-and-a-quarter. His backers for the Epsom Classic, though, can point to the performance of his full-sister Lah Ti Dar to finish second in last year’s St Leger over 14 furlongs.“Too Darn Hot confirmed himself an outstanding juvenile in the Dewhurst where he put some strong form lines firmly in the shade,” Graeme Smith, the British Horseracing Authority’s senior handicapper for juveniles, said on Wednesday. “The last three two-year-olds rated at his level went on to win 15 Group 1s between them, and in what promises to be an above-average Classic crop, he already sets a lofty standard with the potential of better still.”Gosden has two entries in the ratings’ top 10, as Calyx, who missed the remainder of the season through injury after winning the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, earned a mark of 115. He is a 12-1 chance for the 2,000 Guineas while Andre Fabre’s Persian King (114), who took the Group Three Autumn Stakes at Newmarket in October, can be backed at 14-1 for the first colts’ Classic.The top 10 juveniles (with their trainers) in the ratings are:Smith also highlighted the fascinating possibility that Chad Brown’s Newspaperofrecord, the brilliant winner of the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies’ Turf at Churchill Downs in November, could cross the Atlantic to race in Britain this season. While she is not in the European classification, Smith suggested his “private” rating for Newspaperofrecord is 123, 7lb clear of Pretty Polyanna. “She’s head and shoulders above what we saw in Europe last season,” Smith said. “If she can translate that form to Britain this season, they could have a hell of a time coping with her.” As for the “dark horses”, which last year included Without Parole, the winner of the 2018 St James’s Palace Stakes, Smith came up with four picks: Dubai Warrior (John Gosden), Skardu (William Haggas), Sucellus (John Gosden) and Dancing Vega (Ralph Beckett). His Irish counterpart, Mark Bird, had three picks: Chablis and Quote, from the O’Brien stable and with just one run at two, and Al Hilalee, who is with Charlie Appleby in Newmarket.The cold weather has made its mark on the cards with Hereford and Catterick both abandoned on Wednesday morning, leaving the all-weather tracks to come to the rescue.At Lingfield, the veteran Swiss Cross (1.00) could have another win in him in the opener, while Kyllukey (4.40) and Toffee Galore (6.15) both have leading chances in handicaps at Kempton Park."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621d8c91201558890030eebeeadc83301e263a06/426_519_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f133fab29ab5e366f68edb78efb6a199","title":"standup comics who date sarah keyworth catherine bohart interview","story":"When you and your partner are both standups, jokes are a competitive business. But are there any limits? Sarah Keyworth and Catherine Bohart reveal all“When something funny happens to us,” says standup Sarah Keyworth, “it’s almost a race to see who can get it on stage first.” But, her girlfriend Catherine Bohart protests: “It’s not a fair race because…” “I cheat,” Keyworth admits.This is what happens when two comedians are in a relationship: a custody battle over amusing anecdotes. Bohart sets out her terms: “I think universal rules of dibs should apply. We dibs it or talk about it, then it’s based on whoever it suits best.” As a case in point they recall a trip to afternoon tea where a problem with the restaurant’s lighting left everybody eating in the dark. “People were literally getting their phone torches out because they couldn’t see their cake,” remembers Keyworth. “Then we went straight to Sarah’s gig and she starts talking about it,” says Bohart, “and it’s like: ‘What the hell?! We didn’t even discuss that as an option.’”“Yeah,” says Keyworth. “But you got the pilates class with the cat with kidney failure.”They may seem like a double act over our coffee at Soho theatre in London, but Bohart and Keyworth are solo standups who were both breakthrough acts at last year’s Edinburgh fringe. They have been rewarded with London runs of their respective debut shows, Immaculate and Dark Horse. Neither, sadly, features the mythical bit about the pilates class of octogenarians that descends into an open forum of broken computers and recently deceased cats.The pair met in 2015 and now live in London with fellow comic Adele Cliff. The day-to-day reality of comedians co-habiting is “disappointingly boring”, insists Nottingham-born Keyworth. (“We cry a lot, and often we just sit at a table and desperately try to think of something funny to say.”) But being a comedian is a strange and emotionally demanding job. That’s when their relationship seems to really kick in.“Being with another comic, at least they understand the isolation of the job,” says Dubliner Bohart. “They understand that you need to go to Northampton to do a free gig on a Sunday when the other person wants to go to a wedding. It must be much harder for comics who are with a partner who isn’t a comic.”Keyworth agrees. “If you’re having a meltdown because you can’t get the right ending for your bit about condensation, but you’re dating someone who works in a hospital, they’re going to be like: ‘Get a grip, there are actually important things happening in the world.’ Whereas we can look at each other and go: ‘I know this is hard for you. There is definitely something funny about cabbage. We can find it together!’”“Although … who’s going to pay the bills? That’s a question,” adds Bohart. They suggest, semi-jokingly, that a wealthy, asexual husband would be a welcome addition to the Kilburn homestead.There’s no shortage of standup couples: Stewart Lee and Bridget Christie, Sarah Millican and Gary Delaney, Isy Suttie and Elis James, Bobby Mair and Harriet Kemsley. But not much domestic tittle tattle makes it on to the stage. Millican is a kitchen-sink comic who has plenty of material on “her fella” and their sex life. Christie refers to Lee as her “fictional onstage husband”, casting him as a raging bigot. Then there’s the break-up show: a gory new trend in which ex-couples do extraordinarily revealing shows about each other, ideally about 500 metres from each other at the Edinburgh fringe (Sara Pascoe and John Robins were at least pretty civil about it in 2017).But Keyworth, 25, and Bohart, 30, don’t talk much about their relationship on stage. Instead, Keyworth’s Dark Horse, which got her a nomination for best newcomer in Edinburgh, is a quietly powerful show in which she describes her job as a nanny and the loss of confidence she has observed in the girl she looks after. Bohart’s Immaculate is similarly personal: her relationship with her father – a Catholic deacon – comes under the spotlight, particularly in relation to her coming out, and she touches on broader issues such as abortion in Ireland and mental health. As a former university debater, she is shaping up to be a comic who’s combative, and eloquent with it.Her dad is yet to see Immaculate, though she is enthusiastic for this to happen (“so long as I didn’t know he was there”), and she did ask his permission before talking about him on stage. Similarly, Keyworth got the green light from the family she nannies for – in fact they encouraged her to be more open than she was, to keep the real names in the show. Keyworth changed them anyway.Bohart says: “Comedy is always complicated when it comes to the people you’re talking about. They’re always going to say, ‘That’s not exactly true’, because what people say isn’t necessarily … funny, plus it’s just your perspective and you have to make that clear. It feels quite obnoxious that they don’t have the right to reply. Like my dad, I talk about him a lot and I want to represent him fairly as I can, it’s not supposed to be an attack on him but I also want him to be three-dimensional.”In person they are not that much different to their stage characters: Bohart is fluent and resolutely rational, Keyworth is economical and deadpan. And they like a good spar: the interview is all but paused while they debate the precise turn of events when they first met outside a comedy show. Bohart says Keyworth was ruthless and unfriendly, Keyworth pleads innocence. What they do agree on is that they flat-out didn’t like each other for the first few months, until the “passive-aggressive flirting” gave way to the inevitable.Sexuality has been a big influence on both comics’ acts. For Keyworth, it’s part of the reason she became a comic at all. She recalls how she made a conscious effort to become funny at school, to take control of the bullying.“Either I could be this weird little androgynous boy-girl thing,” she says, “or I could be the girl who eats paper and slaps herself in the face. I’d rather be the one making people laugh than being laughed at.”For Bohart, it’s more of a stylistic thing. “What queerness has given me is I think more empathy and more open-mindedness. I read a lot of things that I wouldn’t have if I’d been straight, about queer identity, polyamory, trans issues, feminism … I was looking for a place to understand myself, really. And empathy is a good place for comedy because you can put yourself in other people’s shoes and discern what might be funny or not.”So can we expect any relationship material to appear in the future? The answer is a slightly squeamish yes. “If there was something that made one of us uncomfortable we could discuss it,” explains Keyworth. “But we know how hard it is to write anything.” So if one does a routine about the other one and it’s working: “We’ll just laugh along,” she says. “And cry alone later.”• Sarah Keyworth: Dark Horse is at Soho theatre, London, 28 January-2 February.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now.

I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we’re taking a look at a new cohort of influencers determined to use their devices for more than just selfies. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyThey’re often the first thing we look at when we wake up, the last thing we see before we go to bed, and most of us couldn’t go a few hours without thinking about them. No, not our loved ones, but our phones. According to data from Ofcom, people in the UK now check their smartphones – averaged out of a waking day – every 12 minutes. But instead of seeing that as bad, throwing our devices in the sea and going to live in a cave, a new movement suggests that it’s time to re-evaluate our relationship with social media. Instead of seeing it as a time-sucking temptation that turns us into head-down zombies, used in the right way our smartphones might actually be our best tool for enabling memorable real-world moments and making every day more extraordinary.Ironically, it’s social media influencers who are leading the charge for sustainable use of the medium and the beauty of sharing more meaningful content, even if that means sharing less. Author and broadcaster Emma Gannon is the author of Ctrl Alt Delete, which examines the millennial phenomenon of growing up online and balancing the demands of being an influencer with having a private life.“I started to use social media when I was 11 or 12,” she says. “People say the dopamine rush from social media is like having a hug, so we shouldn’t feel bad when someone retweets us 100 times because that feels amazing. But I think it can be a dangerous cycle if that’s the only way to feel good.“I think the more someone is sharing, the more they need validation. As I grow up, I share less because I feel more confident. I don’t need everyone to know what I’m doing all the time because I just feel happy doing it.”Just as the idea of slow living is gaining popularity, so too is slow social media. Fashion journalist Pandora Sykes describes herself as an “accidental influencer” and recently wrote a blog post about conscious sharing. “Call it selfish (I prefer self-protection), but I’ve recently drawn some parameters in the sand,” she writes.Someone who knows only too well the importance of balancing mental health and social media is Katherine Ormerod. With 49.5k followers and a steady income from Instagram posts, her life online looks like an endless stream of sunset selfies and glamorous parties. “I spent years putting on a great show that my life was pretty perfect, and it was exhausting. Then my husband left me when I was 29 and I couldn’t fake it any more,” she says.In her book Why Social Media Is Ruining Your Life, she speaks to influencers who reveal what their lives are really like away from the glossy hair and chia seed smoothies. “At times, I’ve legitimately loved taking pictures, felt creatively challenged and fulfilled, genuinely happy that I’ve finally found somewhere to express myself,” she says. “But I’ve also dealt with the full gamut of emotion that social media can generate. It’s made me want to buy things I can’t afford, made me feel like I’m lazy in comparison to other people and, at times, made me feel very low. It’s also made me feel overweight, unattractive, poor, unstylish, lonely, left out, unpopular and seriously devoid of a sense of humour.”But by realigning our thoughts about our online lives, Ormerod says it is possible to find your digital happy place. “Social media is here to stay, as are our phones, and while ‘off-gridding’ for a certain amount of time is gaining popularity, for most of us it’s really a matter of conscious, mindful consumption,” she says.“We can carve out a new path for a healthy and beneficial relationship, one where we are in the driving seat, controlling our intake and uptake of these digital platforms so they work for us. Instead of wasting any more time ‘comparing despairing’ or zooming in on our saggy knees.”Similarly, Catherine Price, author of How to Break Up With Your Phone, spent 18 months researching mindfulness and neuroplasticity to develop a comprehensive strategy for how to consciously uncouple with her device from time to time. “I still wanted to use social media, but I wanted a new relationship with it – one with better boundaries, and over which I had more control,” she says. “The goal wasn’t to never use my phone again it was to create a sustainable relationship that felt healthy.”Ormerod agrees and says that it’s not just about unfollowing people who make you feel insecure, it’s about seeking out those who educate and illuminate – the people who inspire you to see the everyday world in a different way. “Find content that is going to inspire you and you’re going to have a far, far better experience.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e75ace068a76be2c12679dc5bce942d8956c7c1/697_556_698_419/master/698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e585baefee96e764e01762b4c080e734","title":"power mentors the community activists inspiring young londoners","story":"Anyone’s surroundings can inspire them to change their life – you just have to be willing to see the world with fresh eyes. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we meet a new breed of activists, such as ex-gang member Karl Lokko, who demonstrate just how important this is. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3When Karl Lokko was 12 years old, his life took its first swerve towards danger. He saw someone shot for the first time, on Brixton’s Myatts Field estate, the south London housing block he called home. For years, the estate had earned a reputation as a place where families and children lived in the crossfire of local conflicts. And for a time, it seemed as though Lokko would commit his life to the gang culture that seemed to thrive in his area. Now, though, he considers that estate one of the most meaningful places in his life.“It had a terrible reputation – branded at one point by the press as the ‘Devil’s Den’,” he says. Even then, it was still the backdrop for the childhood games he remembers playing with friends: “Knock down ginger, 4040 home, run outs and park-swing Olympics.” It’s also where Lokko met Pastor Mimi Asher as a young adult – the woman who would eventually turn his life around.And that’s where Lokko’s story leaps from the everyday into the extraordinary. He didn’t follow a route carved out for him, leading away from school and into life on the streets. Instead, the 28-year-old found himself – and a new focus – as close to home as the gangland distractions. He’s grown into one of several inspiring Londoners who’ve used their combination of experience and personal knowledge to turn well-known spaces and activities into life-changing sites of positive change.In Lokko’s case, that came down to how Asher refocused his energy, leading him to a very different life. As in giving TEDx Talks, striking up a friendship with Prince Harry and working as a charity ambassador. By grabbing his life by the lapels and steering it in a new direction, the poet, activist and influencer has matured into someone who’s able to see the mundane in a new light. Lokko credits Pastor Asher for nudging him away from criminality. She would open her flat on the estate to him and other vulnerable young men. And inside, she ran a Christian faith group, which she described to the  as being less about God and scripture and more “about helping to give young men identity, value and something to believe in”.Other innovators similarly use their surroundings as a springboard for community work and making a positive impact. Fellow poet Momtaza Mehri takes inspiration from her London upbringing and Somali heritage to write forceful works that vibrate with the capital’s energy. As this year’s young people’s laureate for London, she tackles everything from gentrification to race, street violence and the living, breathing history of her city. Mehri says her writing is invested in “questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces”.Elsewhere in the city, Tanya Compas and Charlie Dark work in separate disciplines but both help their communities see themselves in newly affirming ways. Compas is a youth worker, who – through workshops, events and education – empowers young women of colour to see their worth. She’s won several awards, and is one of the Evening Standard’s 1,000 most influential Londoners. Dark founded Run Dem Crew, a running group that began to help inspire young men of colour that has now turned into a city-wide phenomenon in London.Finally, groups such as Muslim Girls Fence – using the sport of fencing to break down stereotypes about Muslim women – and the Big House, bringing isolated care leavers into theatre production, show what can happen when collectives help amplify marginalised voices. As Sarah Saaed, a teenage Muslim Girls Fence mentor put it, the programme “gives me power. It makes me feel like I have strength and I am powerful, and I’m strong and resilient.” Both programmes excel at allowing their participants to see themselves anew.As for Lokko, he’s developed his poetry and songwriting around the city since Asher demonstrated how Myatts Field estate and the wider community could provide inspiration rather than stir up fear. Take the underground, for example: specifically, the Victoria line’s southernmost stop. “As a Brixton boy, any commute across the city started from this point. But what became apparent to me after a while is that poetry was always a by-product on these trips,” says Lokko.And so he wrote the majority of his first poetry collection, The Butterfly Effect, zooming along in tube carriages, he says. “The underground was where people made contact but rarely connected.

Sports Direct, criticised for “workhouse” conditions in its warehouse by MPs in the wake of a  investigation, registered the lowest score among major retailers, with just 6.1.Amazon’s fall to fifth place overall puts it just behind the high street fashion chain Next but ahead of Nationwide Building Society, Netflix and Argos.The ICS did not publish the full list of 247 brands included in the survey, meaning it is not possible to identify which brand was given the lowest score for overall customer satisfaction.Its chief executive, Jo Causon, said: “We don’t publish all of them because it’s about helping organisations to get better. It’s not, per se, a league table.”Of the top 50, the fashion firm Primark scored the lowest, but separate sector-specific reports published by the ICS revealed firms that performed even worse.Among non-food retailers, CurrysPC World did the worst out of the top 25 with a score of 73.6 due to a particularly low score for its handling of complaints.RBS was the worst of 15 banks, scoring 73.5, putting it just below TSB, which plummeted to the second-lowest in the table after its IT meltdown last year.The lowest-performing food retailer was Morrisons on 79."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cce673e30312e296798c9e41d674ad77a827339/372_146_2367_1420/master/2367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=158919e6ed16a60abfe32c2fab7ff0cb","title":"how elon musks secretive foundation benefits his own family","story":"Some of the Musk Foundation’s largest grants have been given to his brother’s charity, his children’s school and his fight against LA trafficThe entire website of Elon Musk’s private charitable foundation is shorter than many of the Tesla CEO’s contentious tweets. “Musk Foundation. Grants are made in support of: Renewable energy research and advocacy Human space exploration research and advocacy Pediatric research Science and engineering education,” the site reads.Documents obtained by the  reveal how the foundation has put that vague mission statement into practice. Together, the documents show that many of the organization’s donations have gone far beyond its stated scope. Some have benefited the billionaire’s own family and initiatives, others have tackled his pet peeves – the foundation has given more money to Musk’s own artificial intelligence research than to any of the more traditional charities it says it supports.As with many other of his achievements, Musk has publicly touted his charitable activities, whether during the Flint water crisis or amid international efforts to rescue a young soccer team trapped in a Thai cave. Musk has given personally to multiple causes and organizations, including multi-million dollar donations to the Sierra Club and the XPrize Foundation, and a $1m grant to the Obama Foundation. But the bulk of his charitable giving has been through this private foundation, for which he provides the entirety of its funding.The Musk Foundation has disbursed more than $54m in 15 years of operations, more than a third in direct gifts to 160 charities, according to an Internal Revenue Services analysis of its filings from its incorporation in 2001 to the middle of 2017. Most recorded awards totalled just a few thousand dollars, and many went to environmental, educational, medical, and space advocacy organizations.Others, however, landed closer to home. Recipients have included a school attended by Musk’s own children, a charity managed by his brother, a protest group fighting gridlock on Musk’s commute to SpaceX, and even an art project at Musk’s favorite festival, Burning Man.In 2012, Musk joined billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and Warren Buffett in signing The Giving Pledge, a commitment by some of the world’s richest iniduals to give away the majority of their wealth, either during their lifetimes or upon their deaths. Musk – who controls Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company – is worth an estimated $22bn, although almost all his wealth is tied up in his own companies.Musk had started organizing his charity givings more than a decade earlier.Musk launched his foundation in 2001, together with his younger brother Kimbal, who’d serve as the organization’s secretary and treasurer. Musk’s first big gift to the foundation came the following year, shortly after eBay bought PayPal, the payments company that Musk had an interest in. Musk gave his organization 30,000 eBay shares, worth $2.1m.In those early days, the foundation made small, uncontroversial donations to Musk’s alma maters in South Africa and the US, to other educational charities, space societies, and children’s hospitals such as the Seattle Children’s Hospital and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.Between 2007 and 2014, Musk topped up the foundation’s coffers with a little over $3.1m in cash. The list of its recipients grew longer – and began to feature more organizations with links to Musk’s own family and interests.The foundation funded photovoltaic systems helping communities affected by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 and the Fukushima earthquake in 2011. Musk’s solar power company Solar City (now part of Tesla) participated in both installations.Also in 2010, the foundation spent $183,000 to help launch Kitchen Community, a Colorado-based charity headed by Kimbal that used “learning gardens” in underserved areas to help children grow and prepare fresh food. Kitchen Community, now called Big Green, would receive a total of nearly half a million dollars over the next four years – one of the foundation’s largest direct awards. As executive director and chairman of the project, Kimbal received nearly $85,000 in payments by Big Green between 2010 and 2016.Between 2011 and 2013, the foundation also made two $50,000 donations to the Mirman School for gifted children in Los Angeles, a school that Elon Musk’s sons were attending at the time. Musk later started his own not-for-profit school, Ad Astra, located within SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, which his children now attend.In 2012, the year Musk signed the giving pledge, the foundation expanded its horizons and donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Los Angeles Police Foundation, and a non-profit organization for professional women in New York’s film, television and digital media industries.It also made three $25,000 payments to a tiny pressure group called Angelenos Against Gridlock. The group was lobbying for improvements to the famously congested Interstate 405 highway that Musk uses regularly to commute from his Bel-Air home to SpaceX. Angelenos Against Gridlock is now defunct, and Musk has turned his attention to building tunnels to whisk Tesla electric cars swiftly beneath the city’s traffic instead.The high point of 2012 was possibly a $10,000 donation to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), a nonprofit that is developing medical therapies using marijuana and MDMA. That donation helped fund the Temple of Whollyness, a large wooden art structure that went up in smoke at the climax of 2013’s Burning Man festival in Nevada.By mid 2015, the Musk Foundation was down to its last $60,000. The following May, Musk donated 1.2 million shares of Tesla Motors, valued at nearly $255m at the time.Musk has long worried about the possibilities of superhuman, malevolent artificial intelligence, likening it to “summoning the demon”. In 2015, he had pledged $1bn to a set up a research company called OpenAI that would develop safer AI in a “way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole”.“Elon’s charitable giving has kick-started AI safety research, transforming it into what is now a vibrant and respectable research area,” said Max Tegmark, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who personally received $9m from Musk for research at the Future of Life Institute.But OpenAI’s non-profit status was still being reviewed by the IRS in 2016, making it impossible for the organization to receive charitable donations. Instead, the Musk Foundation gave $10m to another young charity, YC.org. The charity lacks a website or social media presence but its stated aim is “making grants to other 501(c)3 initiatives and activities that are trying to solve the world’s problems”.Filings show the organization is run by Sam Altman, a director of OpenAI and the president of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley accelerator that has helped to launch hundreds of technology start-ups, including Airbnb, Cruise Automation and Dropbox. Altman is also a director of OpenAI.The Musk Foundation’s grant accounted for the majority of YC.org’s revenue, and almost all of its own funding, when it passed along $10m to OpenAI later that year. Open AI’s tax filings show its top researcher alone was paid $1.9m in 2016. Though that’s not out of line with what some top AI researchers make, it’s more than the Musk Foundation handed out to all other charitable causes during its first eight years of operation.Also in 2016, the Musk Foundation made its largest disbursement to date, giving $37.8m to Vanguard Charitable. It’s a donor-advised fund – a tax-efficient giving vehicle that holds money on behalf of multiple clients and distributes it over time. This type of structure makes it difficult for the public to tell which client is making which awards, a benefit for the publicity-shy.While secrecy was not Musk’s motivation for using donor-advised funds, he does believe that true philanthropy is done for the most part anonymously, a spokesperson for the foundation told the .There are some hints that the foundation could be returning to grassroots giving. Last summer, Musk tweeted that he would help address the public health crisis in Flint, Michigan. The foundation said that it has donated more than $1m worth of water filtration equipment and laptops to causes in the city. But, if Musk continues to use Vanguard, it would make his already secretive foundation even less transparent in future years.Neither Elon nor Kimbal have ever accepted any compensation for their work with the foundation, nor are there any other salaried staff at the organization, filings indicate.None of Musk’s charitable decisions are particularly uncommon for a billionaire’s private foundation, said Harvey Dale, director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law at New York University. Many wealthy iniduals fund their children’s schools, and support their own charities and initiatives, he explained.Even the foundation giving money to Big Green, which in turn paid Kimbal, may not be problematic. Big Green did not respond to requests for comment, but the Musk Foundation noted that Elon Musk has no involvement in Big Green and was unaware of any payments to Kimbal. It also said that those payments have now stopped.On Wednesday, the foundation added aline to its website, stating its support for the “development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56cc53832ed811feed045b3b732daefa8f55e56c/613_104_3387_2033/master/3387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df0fa430f3fc1064d3ff99d790f4ef98","title":"abu bakar bashir must renounce radicalism before release says indonesia","story":"President changes tack after agreeing to release alleged mastermind behind Bali bombings on humanitarian groundsIndonesia’s president says the alleged mastermind behind the Bali bombings won’t be released from prison unless he renounces radicalism, backing down from plans to free him without conditions.President Joko Widodo said on Tuesday that Abu Bakar Bashir must fulfil conditions such as loyalty to the state and the national ideology to be eligible for release.Bashir is considered the spiritual leader of Islamist group Jemaah Islamiah, which was implicated in the 2002 Bali bombings, in which more than 200 people were killed, 88 of whom were Australian.The radical Muslim cleric was convicted of terrorism charges in 2010 over links to militant training camps in Aceh province and jailed for 15 years.The 80-year-old insists he is answerable only to God and that Indonesia should be governed by Islamic rather than civil law.Widodo said: “There are legal mechanisms that we must go through. This is parole, not pure release, but conditional release, so the conditions must be fulfilled first.”Widodo on Friday said he had agreed to Bashir’s release on humanitarian grounds.On Monday, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, voiced his concerns, saying: “Australians died horrifically on that night, and I think Australians everywhere would be expecting that this matter was treated with the utmost seriousness by our government, which it is.“But also that the Indonesian government would show great respect for Australia in how they manage this issue.”Bashir’s family had requested his release since 2017 because of his age and deteriorating health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe16ae84d46259b70da00e240b4d867ef4cc178/0_0_1798_1079/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f301360de15681658bfe895898c78028","title":"woman indian temple family sabarimala kerala","story":"Kanakadurga, 39, allegedly beaten and ousted from home for entering Sabarimala shrineA woman who defied violent protests to worship at a centuries-old south Indian shrine that banned females of “menstruating age” has been spurned by her family, attacked by relatives and locked out of her home.On New Year’s Day, Kanakadurga, 39, along with Bindu Ammini, became the first women to enter the inner sanctum of Kerala state’s Sabarimala temple, one of the country’s holiest Hindu sites.The supreme court had in September declared unconstitutional a customary ban on women aged between 10 and 50 from entering the temple, a hill shrine located at the end of a three-mile trek through dense mountainous forest.Kanakadurga, Ammini and hundreds of other women had attempted to reach Sabarimala once it reopened after September’s verdict but were turned away by sometimes violent protesters, mostly men, who see the court’s decision as inappropriate state intervention in a religious matter.The pair – Kanakadurga, a government employee, and Ammini, a 40-year old law lecturer – entered the temple to pray with police protection in the early hours of 1 January. The same day, hundreds of thousands of women in Kerala formed a 380-mile human chain across the length of the state in support of gender equality.“A lot of people tried to dissuade us and make us turn back – police officers, our friends … because they knew we were facing a lot of backlash,” Kanakadurga, who like many Indians uses one name, told Reuters after the climb.The pair went into hiding after entering the temple and have been granted 24-hour police protection. Kanakadurga was admitted to hospital last week after a female relative allegedly beat her with a plank of wood minutes after she returned home.On Tuesday, Kanakadurga, a mother of two, slept in a government-run shelter after she returned home to find her husband had locked the doors and gone into hiding.Police tried to mediate with her husband’s family but were told she would not be accepted back until she “atones for her sins”, Ammini told the Hindustan Times. “I talked to her this morning also. She is in high spirits. Some forces are pressurising her family but they won’t succeed.”Kanakadurga’s brother told a group of Ayyappa devotees on Sunday that his family had also distanced themselves from her.A third woman, aged 46, has reached the temple since the two women’s entry, the office of the chief minister of Kerala said on 4 January. Dozens more, including some in men’s clothing, have been turned back by demonstrators, backed by the temple’s administrators.Lord Ayyappa, the deity who is worshipped at the shrine by up to 50 million people each year, was traditionally celibate, and many devotees fear the presence of women would contravene his explicit wishes and “pollute” the sacredness of the site.Pilgrims preparing to visit Sabarimala traditionally abstain from alcohol, meat and eggs and take a vow to be celibate for 40 days before their visit.Lifting the ban on women has been opposed by the Bharatiya Janata party, the Hindu nationalist party that controls India’s central government, as well as its traditional opponent the Congress party. Kerala’s ruling Communist party government supports the verdict.The prime minister has been careful not to criticise the supreme court but instead focused his ire on the Kerala state government that is enforcing the decision.“We knew that the communists do not respect Indian history, culture and spirituality but nobody imagined they will have such hatred,” Narendra Modi said at a rally in the state last week."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3767233.1548190793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it tralee overstaffed and has significant money issues report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFile image of IT TraleeAn independent review of finances at Institute of Technology Tralee has concluded that the institution is overstaffed, losing money and experiencing significant cashflow difficulties.The  has learned that the Higher Education Authority (HEA) commissioned a review into IT Tralee last year amid concerns over its financial position. The institute currently has 3,500 full- and part-time students, employs about 350 staff and operates on two campuses in Tralee, Co Kerry.The review, carried out by Deloitte and finalised in recent months, is understood to express concern about the growing deficit at the college, which it forecasts could rise to €4 million in the coming years, and also raises questions over IT Tralee’s future funding projections.It says the institute will need to find €3 million to fully complete the Kerry Sports Academy, a centre of excellence on campus which will be used by students and county GAA teams.The concerns come at a sensitive time, given plans to merge IT Tralee with Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) to create a technological university for the Munster area. The scale of financial challenges at IT Tralee has raised alarm within some circles at CIT on the basis that the Cork institute would likely face absorbing these deficits.IT Tralee declined to comment, except to say its audited accounts to August 31st, 2017, will be a matter of public record by the end of next month.“The institute will not be providing additional information on its financial status at this time,” a spokeswoman said.In a statement, the HEA acknowledged that for some time IT Tralee has been in a “challenging financial position”. “The HEA continues to monitor this situation and work with ITT as it seeks to stabilise its finances,” it said.Sources familiar with the report’s findings say the institute’s funding difficulties are partly linked to a sharp decline in full-time student numbers, which fell by more than 15 per cent between 201415 and 201718.Based on its own accounts, the institute projects it will not generate a surplus until 202122, with improvements driven mainly by a rise of more than 20 per cent in student numbers over the next five years.However, the report says third-level student numbers nationally are only projected to rise by just 7 per cent in the same period, according to sources.In addition, census figures for the Kerry area show a slight decrease in the college-going population over this timeframe.Sources also say the report says the institute appears to be overstaffed relative to its student numbers.One recommendation is that the Government set up a voluntary redundancy or early retirement programme, though sources say this would only be an option if it was available across the third-level sector in general."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3767766.1548240371!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prospect of border checks in france and netherlands downplayed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar is to meet all party leaders in the Dáil on a fortnightly basis to maintain political consensus on the approach to Brexit. File photograph: Tom HonanSources at Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s briefing of Opposition leaders on Tuesday night downplayed the prospect of border checks in France and the Netherlands that could affect Irish trade in the case of a no deal Brexit. While Mr Varadkar did mention the prospect of such checks, a number of those present said it was a remark made in passing. It was not, said one source, as if Mr Varadkar referenced checks in Calais and the Rotterdam as a concrete plan being proposed by the European Commission. The general mood of of the meeting, it was added, was a “strong consensus” that the “deal on the backstop should be pursued” and that the Government should “give no ground” on the backstop. Mr Varadkar is to meet all party leaders in the Dáil on a fortnightly basis to maintain political consensus on the approach to Brexit. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald confirmed Mr Varadkar did not suggest an EU single market border could be in France or the Netherlands rather than Ireland.Asked on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland if such a proposition was “a runner”, Ms McDonald said: “This is absolutely not a runner, I have to say that was not forwarded as a proposition by Leo Varadkar or by anybody else as the objective here.”Asked if Mr Varadkar had not set up the notion of a border in Calais or Rotterdam as “a proposition or a desirable outcome”, Ms McDonald said: “He didn’t set that up as a proposition or a desirable outcome.“I have emphasised to the Taoiseach time out of number that the task now for him and his government is to hold their nerve.“We need very steady heads, whatever pressure, whatever overtures that comes from London or anywhere else, the backstop has been negotiated. It’s not perfect. “Brexit is still bad news and I say that as somebody who is very critical of the European Union, but let me tell you whatever criticism of the European project, Brexit for this country was never the answer.”Ms McDonald told Morning Ireland that European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas was right when he said there would need to be a hard border in Ireland in the event of a no deal Brexit.That was why the backstop was so important, as it mitigated the effect of Brexit in the event of the UK “crashing out” with no agreement, she said.The Government has the responsibility to start preparing for that eventuality, she said.The first job is to look for “breathing room” for Irish businesses, for society in general and for peace structures.Later, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said the Government is not countenancing a border infrastructure on the island of Ireland, “in any shape or form”, in the context of Brexit preparations.He said that any reimposition of checks and border infrastructure would run the “high risk” of leading the country back into a situation where we would revisit the troubles.Meanwhile, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a temporary safeguard to avoid erecting a physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit would serve no purpose.In an interview published in the newspapers Le Monde, Rzeczpospolita and Luxemburger Wort on Wednesday, Mr Barnier said the current backstop proposal over the border was the only option on the table. “The question of limiting the backstop in time has already been discussed twice by European leaders. This is the only possible option because an insurance is of no use if it is time limited,” Mr Barnier said.European Union Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday the risk of a no deal Brexit had increased in last few weeks and it was up to the British to tell the EU what they wanted.With Britain due to leave the bloc on March 29th, Mr Moscovici told Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the EU was ready and waiting, and nobody wanted a no deal outcome. - Additional reporting Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3767243.1548191963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government rejects idea hard border needed in no deal scenario","story":"Responding to questions at the daily press briefing, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas confirmed that  a no-deal Brexit would mean a hard border. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas.  A commission source was adamant that Mr Schinas’s comments merely expressed a “statement of the obvious”. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe Government strongly rejected suggestions from the European Commission on Tuesday that a hard border would be necessary if the UK leaves the EU without a Brexit deal.However, senior figures privately admitted to being taken aback by the intervention in Brussels by the commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas, who said “you will have a hard border” when asked at a daily press briefing about the effect of a no-deal scenario on Ireland.Tánaiste Simon Coveney quickly sought to rebuff the assertion by insisting the Government would not accept the “re-emergence of border infrastructure on this island”.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar later told the Dáil that if there was a no-deal outcome, the British and Irish governments and the EU “would have to negotiate an agreement on customs and regulations that would mean full alignment so there would be no hard border”.“We are not going to be putting up border infrastructure,” a spokesman for the Taoiseach said, adding that the Government was not notified in advance of Tuesday’s comment by his counterpart in the commission.Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney said that in a no-deal scenario the Government would have to protect the EU single market and customs union.The Government also issued a statement pointing out that commission president Jean Claude Juncker had told the Dáil last year that there would be no hard border after Brexit.The backstop, an insurance policy agreed between the EU and UK to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland after Brexit, has proven to be a major sticking point in attempts to move the withdrawal agreement through Westminster ahead of the March 29th deadline.MPs could vote next week on an amendment calling for UK prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal to be approved on condition that a time limit is added to the Northern Ireland backstop.Government sources played down the suggestion that the commission was seeking to put pressure on Ireland to ease its position on the backstop. Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney both stressed that the backstop would not be changing.A commission source was adamant that Mr Schinas’s comments merely expressed a “statement of the obvious”, and did not represent a new approach or a hardening of its position.Recently, he said, Mr Schinas had addressed the same issue more obliquely by observing that in the event of a no-deal UK departure Ireland would need to uphold its obligations to defend the integrity of the single market, a clear reference to the need to install border controls.To date, however, the commission has refused to be drawn on the issue despite repeated questions from journalists, and appeared content to let the Government dismiss the problem by insisting it would not be planning for border controls.Privately, however, commission officials have been deeply sceptical that would be possible, and diplomats from several member states have also said they believe that Ireland would come under pressure from European capitals to protect the single market.The Taoiseach on Tuesday night met the other party leaders to brief them on Brexit and a forthcoming package of legislation to deal with the possible consequences of a no-deal in two months’ time.Sources at the meeting said the party leaders expressed unanimous support for the Government’s position on the backstop.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

The real problem is that we have too many families who cannot cook. So the easiest thing is to buy takeaways or ready meals and sit around the television and eat.“Families should make an effort to have the TV off around meal time and have a conversation while eating. It slows the speed of eating and means you wolf down fewer calories.”Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said:  “There is some evidence to suggest that watching screens can distract children from feeling full. What’s more, we know that children are often exposed to adverts for unhealthy food and drink whilst watching their favourite TV shows, which in turn can lead to higher calorie intake.Our screen time guidance recommends that parents and their children build screen time around positive family activities – such as sharing meals together. But with one in three children leaving primary school overweight or obese, it is clear that action is needed at a national level to tackle the childhood obesity problem. That’s why we want to see Government publish their consultation on restricting junk food marketing before the 9pm watershed on TV, with similar restrictions online, without delay, he said. The chief medical officer said she had embraced the label of “chief nanny” after years of being described as such.“It\u0027s good to be the chief nanny if it has an impact,” Dame Sally told the event, reiterating calls for extra taxes on sugary and salty snacks.“I am wearing my label with pride,” she said. However, she questioned whether a male chief medical officer would have attracted the same nickname, saying the issue “raised questions” about sexism.Advice or admonition | Dame Sally\u0026#039s previous warnings“We won\u0027t go there,” she continued. “Just make the changes and chief nanny will be happy.”And she urged politicians to listen to her calls to extend the sugar levy, extending taxes so they were placed on chocolates, sweets, and cakes as well as on milky drinks.“We need political will. If you look at outcomes think how many lives were saved by seat belts,” she said.“Think how many lives were saved by the smoking ban in public places. Think how many lives  could be saved by extending the sugar levy. Politicians do need to listen to me - and I keep telling them this,” she said.Children as young as five should be offered \u0026#39smartphone therapy\u0026#39Brexit latest news: Brussels ready to entirely \u0026#39rework\u0026#39 future relationship as Theresa May faces grilling at PMQsHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winYoung woman killed by police car responding to 999 call in WalthamstowAustralian-Chinese dissident writer \u0026#39detained\u0026#39 on return to ChinaWhy extending Article 50 looks inevitable, how it could happen and the consequences of delaying BrexitLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowChinese model in ‘racist’ Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana controversy says ad campaign ruined her careerBurns Night 2019: How Scottish favourite haggis could have English rootsNicolas Maduro accuses Mike Pence of trying to force a coup as Venezuela braces for massive rival protestsUK weather: Ice warnings as snow falls and temperatures expected to drop furtherWho might replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

Mr Yang worked for China’s foreign ministry before taking Australian citizenship and growing more outspoken on a spate of issues relating to the Chinese government. He was previously detained by Chinese authorities in 2011.“Dr Yang is not only brilliant but extraordinarily popular among the Chinese speaking world,” tweeted John Garnaut, a China expert and friend of Mr Yang, describing him as a “courageous and committed democrat”.“This will reverberate globally, if authorities do not quickly find an off-ramp,” Mr Garnaut wrote.Christopher Pyne, Australia\u0026#39s defence minister, is due to visit Beijing as fears grow over an Australian citizen reported missingDetails of Mr Yang’s case emerged just before Christopher Pyne, Australia’s defence minister, was due to arrive in Beijing for talks on Thursday.It also comes at at time of heightened tension between China and Western countries, which have escalated after Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, a top Chinese telecoms executive, in Vancouver on a US extradition request over an Iran sanctions violation.Beijing has issued threats against both Canada and the US in response, even detaining at least 13 Canadians in a move that critics say is in retaliation over the Meng arrest. Australia has also expressed concern over China’s behaviour.China denied having any knowledge of Mr Yang’s case on Wednesday.I am not aware of the situation about this Mr Yang and I can’t tell you whether it will be a topic of discussion between the two sides, said Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, when asked at a regular press briefing whether the issue would be discussed during Mr Pyne’s visit to China.A consular agreement between Australia and China requires either government to inform the other within three calendar days if one of their citizens is detained, and diplomats are also entitled to communicate with that person.Please review our commenting policyChildren as young as five should be offered \u0026#39smartphone therapy\u0026#39Brexit latest news: Brussels ready to entirely \u0026#39rework\u0026#39 future relationship as Theresa May faces grilling at PMQsHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winYoung woman killed by police car responding to 999 call in WalthamstowWhy extending Article 50 looks inevitable, how it could happen and the consequences of delaying BrexitLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowChinese model in ‘racist’ Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana controversy says ad campaign ruined her careerBurns Night 2019: How Scottish favourite haggis could have English rootsNicolas Maduro accuses Mike Pence of trying to force a coup as Venezuela braces for massive rival protestsUK weather: Ice warnings as snow falls and temperatures expected to drop furtherWho might replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

We are with you.Maduro responded by accusing the US, through Pence, of trying to engineer a coup.Venezuela\u0027s government ominously predicted there would be violence against opposition protesters, although claiming it would be self-inflicted in a bid to portray the regime as brutal.Venezuela\u0027s Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez even said Monday\u0027s mutiny, in which soldiers took over a command post in the north of Caracas and called on the public to head to the streets in repudiation of Maduro, was merely a ruse to steal weapons.US Senator Marco Rubio warned of manipulation by Venezuela\u0027s intelligence service, urging them to reconsider the plan they have for tomorrow before it\u0027s too late.Monday\u0027s mutiny was quickly put down. Twenty-seven soldiers were arrested and Rodriguez claimed they confessed to handing out weapons to opposition activists so they can carry out acts of violence, (cause) injuries and deaths during the protest.An anti-government demonstrator throws a Molotov cocktail during clashes with police and troops in the surroundings of a National Guard command post in CotizaThe mutiny sparked at least 30 small protests in different parts of Caracas, according to a non-governmental organization monitoring social conflict. Police used tear gas against some of the demonstrators.We leave the violence to others, Guaido said.Tomorrow is about reuniting as a people to tell the world about the steps we\u0027re going to take to end the usurpation, to achieve a transitional government and a free election.Although Guaido insists he has the backing of the constitution in his bid to overthrow Maduro, the National Assembly has been impotent since 2017 when the Supreme Court, dominated by regime loyalists, stripped it of all its powers.Guaido has acknowledged as much. He says he needs the help of the people and the military to achieve his aims. Juan Guaido speaks before a crowd of opposition supporters during an open meeting at the Central University of CaracasAnalysts say the opposition is not united and faces huge challenges. The scale of its public support will be seen on Wednesday, symbolic because on that day in 1958 the military dictatorship of Marcos Perez Jimenez fell.In calling on government supporters to take part in a counter-rally, Maduro\u0027s right-hand man Diosdado Cabello suggested the regime would hold fast. The only transition is to socialism, he said.These will be the first mass street rallies since 125 people died during protests between April and July, 2017.The biggest stumbling block to potential opposition success is the military high command\u0027s loyalty to Maduro.Guaido has tried to break that bond by offering an amnesty to any personnel in the 365,000-strong military who disavow the president. There are also 1.6 million civilian militiamen.Monday\u0027s mutiny gave a hint that there are isions in the armed forces, and the Citizen Control non-governmental organization says around 180 soldiers were arrested in 2018 for conspiring against the government, while 4,000 more deserted the National Guard.Public discord was provoked by Venezuela\u0027s worsening economic crisis. Poverty has been on the increase as people face shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicine.About 2.3 million people have fled the crisis since 2015, according to the United Nations, while those left behind face failing public services including water, electricity and transport.A crash in the price of crude in 2014 was the catalyst for Venezuela\u0027s meltdown, and oil production has declined to barely a third of the level a decade ago.At the same time, inflation has soared, and the International Monetary Fund predicts it will reach 10 million percent this year.Brexit latest news: Brussels ready to entirely \u0026#39rework\u0026#39 future relationship as Theresa May faces grilling at PMQsHow a second Brexit referendum could work: the question, when it will happen and who would winYoung woman killed by police car responding to 999 call in WalthamstowAustralian-Chinese dissident writer \u0026#39detained\u0026#39 on return to ChinaWhy extending Article 50 looks inevitable, how it could happen and the consequences of delaying BrexitLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowChinese model in ‘racist’ Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana controversy says ad campaign ruined her careerBurns Night 2019: How Scottish favourite haggis could have English rootsUK weather: Ice warnings as snow falls and temperatures expected to drop furtherWho might replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

But repeated rumours have suggested that Apple was in fact working to get AirPower out much earlier, but that technical issues had got in the way of making it available to the public.Those reports chime with similar claims earlier this month that AirPower was on its way and was making its way through Apple\u0027s supply chain. The beginning of production comes after Apple solved the technical issues – thought to be problems with overheating and other challenges – according to numerous reports.When Apple revealed AirPower in September 2017, promising it would be available soon, it showed a rounded charging mat that would allow people to charge phones and Apple Watches alongside AirPods in a special new case. But there has been no sign of the new product – with major events like the release of the iPhone XS and XR passing without a mention.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the UK matched German spending levels it would imply almost another £20bn a year of industrial support.Labour’s commitment to a permanent customs union and acceptance of the Northern Ireland backstop also implies continuing to follow\u0026nbspEU state aid guidelines, even if the UK followed through with Brexit, since this would be the required price of both.Legal analysis backs up the IPPR’s conclusion.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How grave are the potential problems they face? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentLittle is black and white when it comes to BrexitBrexit is a potential headache for every sector, not least Northern Irish agriculture, which does a large amount of cross-border business with the republic.One issue on the minds of those working in the farming\u0026nbspsector is: what will happen to UK agricultural produce sent for processing outside the country after Brexit?Will it still be possible for, say, farmers in Northern Ireland to export milk to the Republic of Ireland, for it to be processed there into milk powder, and then exported again to China with a “produce EU” quality stamp as it is at present?Or will a no-deal Brexit, in which the UK (including\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland) leaves the single market and customs union, upset that arrangement and potentially damage this\u0026nbspparticular industry?On balance, have we benefited from being in the EU?Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory says this is likely to be an issue of domestic labelling regulations, both in the EU and China.It hinges on what the regulations are on “produce EU” certification and whether UK milk dried in Ireland would qualify.Assuming no tariffs then UK milk from Northern Ireland will continue to be exported to the republic. However, depending on the rules agreed, UK exporters will face some trade facilitation costs, for example... to prove that indeed the milk is from the UKEU food labelling regulations\u0026nbspas laid out on the European Commission’s website state that indication of the country or place of provenance shall be mandatory “where failure to indicate this might mislead the consumer as to the true country of origin or place of provenance of the food”.EU regulations also state that a non-EU\u0026nbspcountry of origin, which would be the UK after a no-deal Brexit, “must be\u0026nbspauthorised for introduction\u0026nbspof milk and milk products into the EU”.There’s a related issue known as “rules of origin” in trade.What would happen if a second referendum delivered another Leave vote?This is a requirement under various trade agreements that a certain minimum share of manufactured exports must be made up of local parts to qualify for zero tariffs.Yet Winters says agricultural produce rules of origin will not be the same as those that cover manufactured goods.His advice\u0026nbspfor all suppliers and exporters is to check with local customs and the relevant regulatory authorities rather than making any assumptions.Dr Carmen Hubbard, research leader for The UK in a Changing Europe group, says that another problem potentially facing Northern Irish milk exporters could be new border bureaucracy, even if we ultimately negotiate a free trade deal with the EU.“Assuming no tariffs then UK milk from Northern Ireland will continue to be exported to the republic. However, depending on the rules agreed, UK exporters will face some trade facilitation costs, for example\u0026nbsppaperwork at the border, administrative and compliance costs which will be required to prove that indeed the milk is from the UK,” she says.The future of the agri-food sector certainly matters to many livelihoods on both sides of the Irish border.Employment in the republic is estimated by InterTradeIreland to be around 230,000, with a figure of 26,000 given for Northern Ireland.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The behaviour of big companies shows they think otherwiseClick to followThe IndependentLiam Fox: The Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, has been issuing warnings about the danger of delaying Brexit on the BBC again\u0026nbspwhen he’s actually supposed to be in Davos banging the drum for trade deals that have proved something of a challenge to get moving.\u0026nbspPart of the reason for his making a noise is perhaps because the timing of the trip could hardly have been worse. It came a day after arch Brexiteer Sir James Dyson unveiled plans to ship the gizmo maker’s corporate HQ to Singapore. The company claimed this had nothing to do with Brexit. That was approached with some scepticism.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, P\u0026ampO replaced the British flag with that of Cyprus for its ships’ registration bringing an end to nearly two centuries of history, Sony confirmed plans to move its European HQ from London to Amsterdam, Pets at Home and Dixons Carphone outlined stockpiling measures to protect them from the kicking Mr Fox and his chums seem bent on delivering. \u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialLiam Fox claims no-deal Brexit would not be \u0027national suicide\u0027Chance of Brexit down to ‘50-50’ if MPs vote down PM\u0027s deal, says FoxThe trade generalissimo’s Davos press notice nonetheless contained some fancy figures about the UK’s past attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment, from Deloitte and the UN.\u0026nbspOf course, the UK was in the EU when those investments were made. And these sort of figures are very dependent on the methodology used by which organisation is putting them together. A report from the OECD on the same subject revealed FDI fell sharply between 2016 and 2017. The release didn’t mention that. But as one Tory MP told the Independent of Fox: “He has never been very good at detail.Still, that didn’t stop him from stamping his little feet. Parliament’s attempt to take control of Brexit,\u0026nbsp and the possible delay as a result, would be a worse than no deal, he declared.\u0026nbspCorporate Britain has been saying otherwise for some time now, and lately it has started voting with its feet.As yet, the moves are mostly technical, although it’s notable that drugs group AstraZeneca has suspended investment and none of our big car makers seem minded to put any new money in given the threat no deal poses to their supply chains.\u0026nbspThere have already been some Brexit job losses, and Fox bears a share of the responsibility for them. But they have rather resembled the trailers you see before big Hollywood disaster movies.When the main feature starts, Fox will presumably bluster some more. That will come as slim comfort for those affected, but expecting anything better from this ministerial code breaker (that should be repeated every time he opens his mouth with the thinly veiled Brexit threats he’s been making) is probably a bit too much to ask for.\u0026nbspLet’s face it, this is the man who claimed doing a deal with the EU would be the “easiest thing in human history” during the EU\u0026nbspreferendum campaign.\u0026nbspHe also promised that the government would agree 40 free trade deals with other non-EU countries\u0026nbspthe minute Britain left the EU too.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

If the UK matched German spending levels it would imply almost another £20bn a year of industrial support.Labour’s commitment to a permanent customs union and acceptance of the Northern Ireland backstop also implies continuing to follow\u0026nbspEU state aid guidelines, even if the UK followed through with Brexit, since this would be the required price of both.Legal analysis backs up the IPPR’s conclusion.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And as evidenced by their dominance of the market these contracts clearly represent a convenient method of paying for a car, even for households who are otherwise adding to savings. Their growth is not evidence that people are outspending their income in aggregate.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student debt: are you on top of what you owe?

Further, he noted that interest rates were not expected to rise sharply to pre-crisis levels.“This makes it slightly puzzling to read (as one often does) that household debt is ‘unsustainably’ high. This view is ubiquitous. My suspicion is that, at least in some cases, people come to it because they have in the back of their minds an alternative and rather attractive world in which we all have fewer debts but the same assets,” he said.Mr Broadbent also pointed to analysis suggesting that historically the growth of household debt is more important than the level when it comes to creating the conditions for a crisis.“That doesn’t mean the level of debt doesn’t matter. But it may matter only relative to some sustainable threshold, one that’s not directly observable and that can vary,” he said.“The precise terms, and therefore the riskiness of a given quantity of debt, are not exactly the same in every country.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon’s.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And as evidenced by their dominance of the market these contracts clearly represent a convenient method of paying for a car, even for households who are otherwise adding to savings. Their growth is not evidence that people are outspending their income in aggregate.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student debt: are you on top of what you owe?

Further, he noted that interest rates were not expected to rise sharply to pre-crisis levels.“This makes it slightly puzzling to read (as one often does) that household debt is ‘unsustainably’ high. This view is ubiquitous. My suspicion is that, at least in some cases, people come to it because they have in the back of their minds an alternative and rather attractive world in which we all have fewer debts but the same assets,” he said.Mr Broadbent also pointed to analysis suggesting that historically the growth of household debt is more important than the level when it comes to creating the conditions for a crisis.“That doesn’t mean the level of debt doesn’t matter. But it may matter only relative to some sustainable threshold, one that’s not directly observable and that can vary,” he said.“The precise terms, and therefore the riskiness of a given quantity of debt, are not exactly the same in every country.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new models expected to be released in September of this year are likely to keep much the same design as the current models, and so the LCD display is likely to stick around.Apple\u0027s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveLCD displays have largely fallen out of favour in recent years because they use up more battery than rival OLED technology, which also allows for richer blacks. OLED displays can also be arranged into more unusual shapes, allowing for more radical changes in the phones\u0027 design.The new rumour came from a Wall Street Journal report detailing the concerns at Japan Display, which is being hit not only by the dropping of LCD screens but also the relative lack of demand for the new iPhone XR, which uses its screens.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayThe EU intervention enabled Thanington – which I previously featured in the first instalment of this series – to lose its nickname of “Little Beirut”, but its residents complain that they have lacked public investment ever since, and that this is beginning to show. The 2,794 people who live there work mostly in low-wage jobs, often as cleaners or in supermarkets in and around Canterbury, or they are on benefits. Educational standards are low, illiteracy is high, and many single-parent families are headed by women. Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is why a stodgy literary biopic like The Life of Emile Zola somehow won the main award at the 1937 Oscars. It’s a solid and worthy piece of work, with a grandstanding performance from Paul Muni (under a lot of whiskers) as the campaigning French novelist. The idea, though, that it is one of the “few truly great pictures of all time”, as its own publicity suggested, is clearly idiotic.It may seem churlish to go after an underdog like Rocky but this was an undeserving Best Picture winner. The Academy voters in 1976 acted as if they were punch drunk and had spent too long in the ring with Apollo Creed. The problem with its victory wasn’t so much the film itself but with the other nominees that were spurned in its favour. Taxi Driver, All the President’s Men and Network all surely had a better claim to that year’s statuette.310 8. Around the World in 80 DaysThis was a perfectly amiable big-budget travelogue but you can’t help but suspect its Best Picture Oscar was more to do with the marketing and hustling skills of its producer, Mike Todd, than with any brilliance in the filmmaking. It was directed by the Englishman Michael Anderson, previously best known for The Dam Busters, and featured David Niven as the intrepid traveller, Phileas Fogg, who bets he can travel all the way round the world in a little over two months.Paul Haggis’s Crash is a decent and well-meaning study of the consequences of racism and violence in contemporary LA. It was independently made and had a large ensemble cast, all giving heartfelt performances. However, Robert Altman had covered similar territory better in Short Cuts and the feeling persisted that it had won the Best Picture award because some Academy voters were determined not to give the Oscar to the gay-themed contemporary western Brokeback Mountain.You rarely win an Oscar without a strong marketing campaign. The now disgraced distributorproducer Harvey Weinstein knew the secrets of getting Academy voters on his side better than anyone else in the business. Whether it was the Blitz-like approach to advertising in the trade press, or the timing of the awards screenings, or the way he kept the film’s stars in front of the media or his relentless courtship of the Academy members, he was arguably as important to the Oscar success of the so-so musical Chicago as any of the creative talent behind it.It’s not bad. It’s a love story that touches on mental illness and mathematics (neither usually subjects that Hollywood embraces). Russell Crowe gives a fine performance as John Nash, the Nobel prize-winning boffin with the beautiful but unstable mind. Nonetheless, Ron Howard’s biopic isn’t any kind of classic. It won its Best Picture Oscar in an unusually thin year.Marty, the 1955 winner, isn’t even the best version of its own subject matter. This story, scripted by the great Paddy Chayevsky, about an emotionally repressed Italian American butcher from the Bronx looking for love, had already been made as a live TV drama the year before. In the small-screen version, Rod Steiger gave a superlative performance in the lead role. Ernest Borgnine in the film version can’t help but seem like second best to anyone who saw Steiger in the same part. Whereas the puggish Borgnine makes Marty a figure of pity, Steiger turned him into a full blown tragic hero.810 3. Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.110 10.

End of Sentence.Created with Sketch.The most shocking film twists of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine.

A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel.

The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer.

The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze.

All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The 91st Academy Awards ceremony will take place at the Dolby Theatre on 24 February.There will be\u0026nbspno host\u0026nbspand will instead have a selection of guests introducing special segments throughout the evening.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So it’s something of a miracle that The Favourite has received no less than 10 nominations, including nods for Best Picture, Best Director, Supporting Actress (times two) and Lead Actress. And it looks likely that Olivia Colman, at least, will take home a golden statue for her starring role as Queen Anne.\u0026nbspAlexandra PollardCreated with Sketch.

Annie Hall offers the New York based comedian’s familiar angst and also has a superlative performance from Diane Keaton as the free spirited, preppy heroine he falls in love with.210 9. The Best Years of our LivesWilliam Wyler’s film about three veterans coming home at the end of the war still has a huge emotional kick. They’re from different classes and backgrounds but struggle terribly to readjust to civilian life. Some accuse the film of being pious and self-righteous but it deals frankly and very movingly with both the soldiers’ problems and those of their families and friends in understanding them. It won its best picture Oscar in the year in which It’s a Wonderful Life was also nominated.310 8. An American in ParisThe best MGM musicals showed extraordinary artistry. This is one of the greatest. It’s not just the choreography or Gene Kelly’s wildly energetic performance as the aspiring artist in postwar Paris but the use of colour and sound. The ballet sequence at the end of the film stands alongside that in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s The Red Shoes as a perfect example of filmmaking in which every element balances perfectly.Producer Hal Wallis at Warner Bros had a knack for overseeing films that were both mainstream and had a social conscience. Not only did Casablanca have Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains, but it also dealt with refugees, betrayal and wartime politics. The script by Julius and Philip G Epstein provided lines of dialogue about gin joints, rounding up the usual suspects and playing “As Time Goes By” that are still quoted today. Few other best picture winners are as engrained in the public consciousness as Casablanca.510 6. On the WaterfrontElia Kazan’s On the Waterfront can be read as the director’s attempt at justifying his own craven behaviour, naming names in front of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities, during the communist witch hunts. Its politics are complicated and contradictory. It is also magnificently acted. Marlon Brando gives arguably his greatest performance of all as Terry Molloy, the dockworker and pigeon fancier who could have been a contender in life and in the boxing ring if only his brother had stood by him when he needed him most.610 5. Lawrence of ArabiaEasy to dismiss as a jingoistic widescreen epic, David Lean’s film about TE Lawrence makes astonishing viewing seen in 70mm. It also offers a probing and subtle portrayal of Lawrence (Peter O’Toole), the masochist who is both the quintessential English hero and the quintessential English outsider.Joseph L Mankiewicz’s drama about a young actress on the make and the established star whose career she wants to usurp boasts some of the most caustic dialogue in any Hollywood best picture winner. The brilliance of Bette Davis as the star and of Anne Baxter as the seemingly ingenuous but utterly ruthless young pretender is matched by George Sanders’ wonderfully acidic performance as the theatre critic, Addison DeWitt.Still the greatest sequel in Hollywood history, this film emulated its predecessor The Godfather, in winning the best picture Oscar and out-stripped it in the brilliance of its craftsmanship and performances. Everything here, from Gordon Willis’s cinematography to the parallel stories of Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone as the crime family boss in the late Fifties and Robert De Niro as his father Vito many years before, works near perfectly. The rival Best Picture nominees in 1974 included Lenny, Chinatown and The Conversation (also directed by Francis Ford Coppola). All would have been worthy winners in other years.The western was considered an anachronism and so was Clint Eastwood himself when Eastwood made his blood soaked masterpiece. Eastwood played Will Munny, first encountered as a farmer and family man. Gradually, we learn about his past as a gunman.  “I\u0027ve killed women and children. I\u0027ve killed just about everything that walks or crawled at one time or another, and I\u0027m here to kill you, Little Bill,” he tells old rival Gene Hackman. This brutal and elegiac film was always a shoo-in for its Oscar.Only Billy Wilder could have made a romantic comedy based around infidelity, drudgery and office politics and turned it into a film as delightful as this. Academy voters are sometimes accused of self-righteousness and prudery, but thankfully that didn’t stop them giving the best picture Oscar to The Apartment.These days, it sometimes seems heretical to admit to an admiration for Woody Allen but his best films stand up as well as ever.

Outside of the rare exception, including Greta Gerwig’s nomination for Lady Bird last year, female directors almost never get a look-in when it comes to the main the categories. This year is no different. The Best Director category featured all-male nominees, with the Best Picture category also failing to nominate a single film directed by a woman, despite the expanded list of eight different films. It feels particularly egregious this year, when there were several high-profile and critically acclaimed works directed by women that seem primed for awards season, including Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, Chloé Zhao’s The Rider, and Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace. To see Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me? nominated in several other categories, including Best Adapted Screenplay, makes the exclusion even more glaring.Furthermore, the Academy also failed to nominate a single female cinematographer, editor, or composer. Although these exclusions also reflect that fact women in the industry are rarely granted the kind of high-profile jobs that land you an Oscar nomination, the Academy also has the responsibility to help elevate this female talent, even if their work is lesser-known, so as to put them in the spotlight, get them further work, and finally help break this cycle.\u0026nbspClarisse LoughreyBlack Panther is the first superhero film nominated for Best PictureBlack Panther, Ryan Cooler’s fearless, exhilarating Marvel Comics adaptation, has become the first ever superhero movie to be nominated for Best Picture. In the past, films such as this have been confined mainly to the Sound and Visual Effects categories even Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed Batman trilogy never managed a Best Picture nod. If anything deserved to break that pattern, though, it was Black Panther. Wakanda Forever.\u0026nbspAlexandra PollardJames Bulger’s mother ‘disgusted’ at Oscar nod for film about son Oscar nominations 2019 list in fullOlivia Colman among British actors nominated for OscarsSam Elliott, Marina de Tavira and Yalitza Aparicio score surprise acting nods – but Timothée Chalamet gets snubbedSam Elliott landed a nomination in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role category for his role as Bobby Maine, Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper)’s manager and half-brother in A Star is Born. This is Elliott’s first Academy Award nomination, and the most high-profile accolade he has earned for the part so far. Marina de Tavira, meanwhile, is nominated in the Actress in a Supporting Role category for her performance as mother Sofia in Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, which propelled her to mainstream acclaim. Yalitza Aparicio – who had never acted before she auditioned for Roma – also scored a nomination in the Actress in a Leading Role category, for her role as Cleodegaria “Cleo” Gutiérrez.Notably, Timothée Chalamet’s performance as drug addict Nicholas “Nic” Sheff in Beautiful Boy failed to earn him a nod, despite being overall praised by critics. The film itself isn’t part of this year’s crop of nominees, in what has already been decried as a major snub.\u0026nbspClémence Michallon\u0026nbspForeign language films break out of their categoryOne of the most refreshing things about this year’s nominations is seeing films not in the English language actually represented outside of one single category. It’s a positive move in breaking down the concept that filmmaking is an entirely Hollywood-centric production (with a few UK productions thrown into the mix), hopefully meaning that, in the future, we’ll see the traditional notions of an Oscar-worthy film break down and a greater ersity of cinema actually rewarded. Roma has tied with The Favourite, an English language production, albeit by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, for the most awards with 10 nominations. What’s particularly surprising is to see two performances from the film, Marina de Tavira and Yalitza Aparicio, nominated in the acting categories, especially because it puts Roma in a strong position to win. If it does, it would be the first film not in the English language to win Best Picture. Furthermore, Cold War, by Polish director Paweł Pawlikowski, was also nominated in several categories, including (crucially) Best Director and Best Cinematography.\u0026nbspClarisse LoughreyThe Brits continue to dominate“We want the finest wines available to humanity. And we want them here, and we want them now!”It’s 31 years since the Academy overlooked Richard E Grant’s indelible performance as a hard-drinking thesp in Withnail and\u0026nbspI, that endlessly quotable – and sad – ode to British nihilism. So it’s wonderful news that’s he’s finally been nominated for an Oscar, for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, a comedy-drama in which he dials the exuberance up at every turn. Fellow Brits Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz are both nominated, as expected, for The Favourite, while Christian Bale is up for best actor for his portrayal of Dick Cheney – a role for which he said he was inspired by “satan”.\u0026nbspPatrick SmithPeter Farrelly’s comedy-drama may have scored five nominations, including two acting nods for Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali (in the Actor in a Leading Role and Actor in a Supporting Role categories respectively), but it failed to land a nod in the Directing category – a notable setback in the film’s successful award season thus far. In addition to the two acting nods, Green Book is nominated in the Film Editing and Writing (Original Screenplay) categories, as well as Best Picture – meaning it could still end up being the talk of the night.\u0026nbspClémence MichallonThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art.

Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

Others are planning how to pave the way for a fresh referendum.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHere are the main amendments\u0026nbspthat are likely to be put to a vote\u0026nbspand could determine the course of Brexit.The Labour\u0026nbspleadership\u0027s amendment is significant\u0026nbspbecause it marks\u0026nbspa clear, albeit\u0026nbspsmall, step towards the party backing a fresh referendum.Its motion says the government must allow the Commons to vote on different options to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspLabour moves closer to backing second referendumThese options should, it says, include\u0026nbspa softer Brexit, in line with Labour\u0027s policy of seeking a customs union with the EU and a close relationship with the single market, and a fresh referendum.It means that, for the first time, Labour is calling for MPs to hold a vote on whether to give the public the final say on Brexit.\u0026nbspHowever, the mon says that any such referendum\u0026nbspshould be on\u0026nbspa deal or a proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons - in other words, a public vote should only be held once MPs have\u0026nbspreached a consensus, and voters should not be asked to break the deadlock in parliament.The amendment appears\u0026nbspunlikely to pass. Tory supporters of a Final Say vote are not expected\u0026nbspto support it because they believe\u0026nbspthe Labour motion would complicate matters. They will instead throw their weight behind amendments explicitly designed to lead to another referendum.Even if Labour\u0027s motion passes, it would merely lead to a Commons vote on whether or not to hold\u0026nbspanother public vote. Labour says it would not necessarily order its MPs to back another referendum in such a vote.The\u0026nbspchair of the Commons Brexit committee has tabled a motion asking the government to give MPs a series of indicative votes on the various options for leaving the EU. These are designed to show which plan would be most likely to command a Commons majority.\u0026nbspThe outcomes to be voted on would be those laid out by Mr Benn\u0027s committee in a recent report. They are: another vote on Ms May\u0027s deal\u0026nbspleaving the EU without an agreement on 29 March\u0026nbsprenegotiating the Brexit deal to either make changes to the backstop arrangements, pivot to a Canada-style free trade deal or pursue a softer Brexit via a Norway-style agreement or calling\u0026nbspanother referendum.The idea of holding indicative votes has\u0026nbspbeen backed by several cabinet ministers, including Damian Hinds, the education secretary, Greg Clark, the business secretary and Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThe aim of Ms Cooper\u0027s amendment is very clear: it is designed to stop the UK leaving the EU in March without a deal. The motion tabled by the Commons home affairs committee chair would take away the government\u0027s power to determine the Commons agenda and\u0026nbspwould instead prioritise a debate on her\u0026nbspEuropean Withdrawal No. 3 Bill.\u0026nbspThis bill says that, if no Brexit deal has been agreed by\u0026nbspparliament by 26 February, Ms May must hold a Commons vote on a motion instructing her to delay\u0026nbspBrexit until the end of the year.\u0026nbspIf the vote is passed, she would have to ask the EU to extend Article 50 until 31 December 2019.The plan is the latest version of a proposal devised by a cross-party group of MPs. An earlier version would have handed control of Brexit to the powerful Commons Liasion Committee if the government was unable to secure support for its deal. That was dropped after members of the committee, which is made up of the chairs of all the other Commons committees, voiced concerns.\u0026nbspThe latest amendment is backed by senior parliamentarians from across the Commons and is expected\u0026nbspto secure Labour\u0027s support, meaning it is likely to pass.The main motion being backed by supporters of another Brexit referendum, this\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbsptabled by\u0026nbspformer attorney general Dominic Grieve would\u0026nbspfreeze the centuries-old rule that says the government has the power to decide what MPs debate.Instead, it would allow time for\u0026nbspsix\u0026nbspdebates on Brexit, to take place on 12 February, 26 February, 5 March, 12 March, 19 March and 26 March. These would be on a motion simply saying that the Commons has considered the United Kingdom’s departure from, and future relationship with, the European Union”.Crucially, these motions\u0026nbspwould be amendable, giving MPs the chance to table amendments\u0026nbspproposing a range of outcomes. Mr Grieve is likely to use the opportunity to pursue\u0026nbspa fresh referendum, and has already tabled parliamentary bills that would trigger another public vote.No-deal Brexit to hurt economy of every UK region, CBI predictsMPs and business leaders protest at identical Brexit ‘plan B’40 ministers could resign over no-deal Brexit vote, May warnedAirline meals being stockpiled as travel industry braces for BrexitOther MPs are likely to table amendments calling for a range of outcomes, ranging from a softer Brexit to a no-deal withdrawal. These\u0026nbspwould then be voted on by the Commons. In\u0026nbspthis sense, the\u0026nbspamendment would trigger indicative votes similar to the motion tabled by Mr Benn.Unlike Mr Benn\u0027s plan, however, Mr Grieve\u0027s would ensure\u0026nbspthat the series of votes takes place, rather than simply asking the government to hold them.\u0026nbspIt also leaves open the number of different outcomes that could be voted on, whereas Mr Benn wants only four to be considered.Mr Grieve\u0027s motion has been backed by other supporters of a fresh referendum from the Conservatives, Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than that figure have already voted previously against no-deal.Two other amendments to thwart a no-deal Brexit could also be put to a vote next Tuesday.

In line with our conference policy...our priority is to secure a deal\u0026nbspbut obviously all options need to remain on the table and that includes a public vote.She added: There\u0027s no\u0026nbspguarantee that it will pass even if our amendment passed\u0026nbspand certainly right across the Conservative Party\u0026nbspand in the Labour Party there\u0027s ided opinion as to whether a second referendum should be a preferred option at this stage.Ms Long-Bailey\u0026nbspsuggested that, even if its amendment passes, Labour would not necessarily instruct its MPs to vote for another referendum, saying: That\u0027s something that the party would need to decide at the time.\u0026nbspWith parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, former Conservative leader William Hague said a fresh public vote was now quite likely.Writing in the Daily , he said: It will probably produce only a narrow victory for either side despite a long struggle, and leave a wounded country to limp on afterwards.But it\u0027s coming, unless some extraordinary turn of events prevents it. It\u0027s coming by a process of elimination, not because it\u0027s a good idea in itself.MPs will vote on 29 January on amendments to Ms May\u0027s proposed plan.Commons home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper has tabled a motion that would delay Brexit until the end of the year if no deal is in place by the end of February. With significant cross-party support, the motion is likely to pass if Labour agrees to support it.Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit commitee, has put down a separate amendment calling for MPs to hold a series of indicative votes on various Brexit outcomes.And Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is expected to propose giving parliament to right to seize\u0026nbspcontrol of Brexit if the government cannot pass its deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

May hits back saying: Why doesn\u0027t he just come and talk about it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn says leaving with no deal would be a hammer blow to industries.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe asks whether the government rules out a customs union with the European Union. She refuses to answer the question, instead focusing on Labour\u0027s own Brexit policy.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAsked again, May says her deal allows us to have an independent trade deals after Brexit - something a customs union does not allow.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May is now on her feet at prime minister\u0027s questions - in answer to one well placed question from a Conservative MP, she says the SNP are out of touch with the people of Scotland in demands for a fresh vote on independence.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn says after the overwhelming defeat of the Brexit deal, will the PM listen to her cabinet ministers and take no-deal off the table.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut she says the way to prevent a no deal is by voting for her deal. May says Corbyn has been allowed to sit down with Hamas and IRA but no with her over Brexit.\u0026nbspThis is from the Press Association on Geoffrey Cox\u0027s appearance at the justice committee this morning.\u0026nbspThe release of legal advice to Cabinet on the Brexit deal last month should not be seen as a precedent for future guidance from Government law officers to be made public, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has warned.Mr Cox warned that the prospect of their advice being picked over by TV news channels would impact on the way law officers deliver their opinions on sensitive legal points to the Prime Minister.The Government agreed to publish Mr Cox\u0027s confidential advice on the controversial Brexit backstop after MPs found ministers in contempt of Parliament on December 4 for failing to comply with an earlier instruction to release it.The Attorney General told the Commons Justice Committee the move was an exceptional departure from the principle that law officers\u0027 advice is never revealed by the Government.Asked whether it should be seen as a precedent for future attempts by MPs to obtain confidential advice, he replied: No, I would argue not, because the principle is so vital to the conduct of good government, even more acutely so in circumstances of great public interest and controversy.Mr Cox warned: If every time the Attorney General now has to consider whether or not his advice is going to be put up on a 24-hour rolling news programme and pulled apart in a 45-second analysis - without the nuance, without the context, without the bits that weren\u0027t in bold, and only those bits in bold accentuated - he is going to have to consider how does he express himself in future.The Attorney General\u0027s advice, published on December 5, was seized on by Brexiteers because it confirmed the backstop arrangements required by the EU to keep the Irish border open could be indefinite.He told the cross-party committee: I published my advice on this occasion because of the very exceptional circumstances at that time.I took the view that it was vital that Parliament at this particular time should not go on feeling - as a majority plainly did - that it was being denied a useful assistance and that it was important we should be able to work with Parliament.I have the greatest respect for the House\u0027s judgments. It was a situation of acute regret for me personally that the House should have come to the conclusion that the Government was in contempt.I took the view that there was a public interest in the House\u0027s standing being upheld that, having reached a judgment that the Government was in contempt, in those circumstances the Government should comply.Mr Cox told the committee the convention that law officers\u0027 advice remains private is a crucial constitutional principle.In an interview with the Luxembourg Times, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, has been asked about the prospect of delaying Brexit by seeking an extension to Article 50.\u0026nbspHe says: If Britain asks for an extension, it has to be approved by EU leaders. They will only agree if three questions are answered: first and second, why and how long? And third, will not that be a problem for holding the EU elections in May? I have no clear legal answer to the third question yet. It is important that the EU\u0027s democratic processes are not disturbed by this, however.\u0026nbspThe first two questions are complex and interconnected: it needs a stable majority in London for all laws related to Brexit that need to be adopted. This will need time.\u0026nbspDashing the hopes of Theresa May and prominent Brexiteers he says: We cannot tie the backstop to a time limit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn news unrelated to Brexit, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is being questioned at parliament\u0027s justice committee.\u0026nbspHe says there have been significant cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and he believes the institution will not be able to sustain\u0026nbspits current service, if further budget cuts are made. He says the government has no intention to do so.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon’s.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They used their guard dogs to bite us too.Yannick worked every day for three years.“They provided no food or water. I’d go home and my body would ache all over, he adds.The physical abuse was hard to take. It was dficult to work not knowingyou were the next person to get hit. Luckily no one was killed at the mine where I worked.”Yannick was paid ,or ,Congolese francs a day – depending on what he found – and what the mine owners wanted to pay.He says he used some of his money to buy food such as doughnuts and mangoes.But some days I didn’t earn anything or couldn’t afford to feed myself - the costs were massively inflated.They even tried to sell us alcohol, marijuana and cigarettes. I did buy them – they gave me a  courage to go on.Yet Yannick was one of the lucky ones. Thanks to local charity The Good Shepherd  he has received medical care, food, and therapy to come to terms with his time in the mines. Today he is training to be a mechanic.“I hope that the children can escape or be helped to lead a new le. I would ask the large companies using the cobalt to help them get out of the work and be able to go to school.“I’m lucky I escaped and have got a good le ahead.Children such as Grace - who was fostered a few years ago and is now training to be a nurse - and Yannick risked inhaling toxic mineral dust every time they took a breath while working in the mines.Sister Pascaline Mukebo, the Assistant Manager for the Good Shepherd Programme in Kolwezi who works with the children, tells Sun Online:It isn’t unusual to see children with blood running from their noses from it.Jean Lenge, manager of the child protection at the Good Shepherd Programme in Kolwezi, South DRC, explains: “The children give the cobalt they find to negotiators from the companies who decide how much they get paid.But from what weve heard from the children and the communities, it’s our opinion that the negotiators take advantage of the children, and there is no system to protect them.There are official guards hired by companies to patrol.“The exploitation of children working in the mines is shocking. There are soldiers who hit them and those who demand money from them just to enter the mine, adds Jeane.The cobalt mined by the children is refined in other parts of the world before being exported to China, where its sold to electronic companies worldwide.The hard grey metal is used in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries for mobile phones, laptop computers, power tools and electric cars.Amnesty International published a  report, finding that one of the largest companies at the centre of the trade is Congo Dongfang Mining International.This a  per cent owned subsidiary of China-based Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company - which supplies Apple Inc., Dell, HP Inc, Huawei, Microsoft Corporation, Samsung, Sony and Vodafone.Amnesty International researcher Lauren Armistead has visited the DRC on several occasions.The charity followed up their  report a year later, looking at the progress companies were making to address conditions for workers.“While we discovered that there is more transparency regarding the supply chain, there is limited progress, says Lauren.The  Report Time To Recharge concluded that few companies have identied the origin of their cobalt.“The best performer was Apple, whereas the poorest performers included Huawei and Microsoft.Lauren says that none of the companies are taking all the necessary measures to know their cobalt supply chain.“It’s boom time for cobalt. Work in the mines will increase with the future demand for cobalt for electric cars - but children need to be re-integrated into school and workers need to get a fair wage.“We’re not calling for boycotts, no one product is better than the other. But none of the companies are being transparent about what they’re doing to look for and address issues in their supply chains.Jean Lenge adds: Those global tech companies know perfectly well that it is children who are sent looking for the mineral. I am fairly certain they know that children are dying as a result of being exploited.”Samsung said: At Samsung, we take our role seriously to source ethically and responsibly throughout our supply chain, including the minerals used in our products.Samsung is a member of the RMIwhich is working to establish industry –wide governance standards for responsible minerals including cobalt. As part of this initiative, Samsung is in the process of mapping our supply chain related to Cobalt sourcing and expanding the scope of the company’s mineral policy.Over the past several years, we have taken steps to improve our supply chain and provide support to local communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we will continue those efforts in   and beyond. More information about our efforts can be found in our  Sustainability Report.While Apple said: Apples Supplier  Responsibility report confirms they have mapped their supply chain from manufacturing to the smelter level for tin, tantalum, tungsten, and goldin  and cobalt by  - the first company to do so.In , they began work with Pact, a nonprofit organization that works to help mining communities in the DRC organise, and protect miners, mining communities, and their children.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What a powerful statement.This school’s success is rooted in a couple of factors. It has a dedicated “study centre” open from am until pm.The centre was opened after the school realised that some of their students who live in busy or chaotic households don’t have access to a quiet study space.Role models are emphasised within the school, which has created a “university access team” featuring five full-time members of staff who are all Oxbridge graduates.Quite apart from the academic challenges — the privilege and elitism surrounding the world of Oxbridge is so intimidating that even the brightest kids coming from ordinary households could easily conclude that they wouldn’t belong.So the university access team also help them to see Oxbridge as an achievable goalThey take students to museums and find other ways to get them excited about study.Their sole aim is to support potential candidates, from  upwards, to get into good universities. I often say you can’t help where you start but you can decide where you end up.And this is a brilliant example.This kind of success comes down largely to self-belief.These children have been encouraged to visualise a very bright future for themselves, and to believe that they are worthy of it. And with that powering you, the sky really is the limit.Which is why the story about a young woman called Liv Conlon, from Bothwell near Glasgow, also caught my eye.Liv set up her first business at , importing goods from China and selling them online.She used the money she made from that to start another company, called The Property Stagers, which furnishes empty homes and, after years of bullying, decided to leave school at  to run it full time.Liv is now . The company furnishes more than  properties a year, and she’s hired a team of ten people – including her mother and brother.She’s also bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat — all without the help from the Bank of Mum and Dad.She believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her set on being a success.“It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that just put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better.”An outstanding attitude and what a role model Liv is.Nothing is more powerful than feeling irrepressible and the desire to cock a snook at the people who don’t want you to achieve.Both these stories prove the same point: If you believe in yourself – and you are prepared to work hard – there is no limit to what you can do.Yes, you need a bit of luck. But in my experience the harder you work, the luckier you get.DJ Sara Cox said this week she has to “work at friendship” as she gets older, words that really resonated for me.When you are young friendships are the backbone of your le and feel effortless.But things change.Andyou aren’t careful you get boring.I’m shocked at how easy it can be to reach a point where you don’t want to go out or do anything in your spare time.But you know what  It’s so important to force yourself off the sofa every so often and have a laugh with your girlfriends. I just need to get Dry January out of the way first.No wonder some envious people have been making mean comments.Meghan has glided through the past few months with real dignity, while also looking a milllion dollars.She is positively glowing. . .  something I never quite managed during pregnancy, despite all the promises.MY heart went out this week to Andy Murray, and the despair he so clearly feels that his body is letting him down and ending his career.It’s a reminder that the toughest part of the job for sports stars is the end. And the higher you’ve flown, the bigger the fall.I had a glimpse of how it feels ten years ago when I sold my business and had a bit of a . . . lull, before the next thing happened.During that time, I’d phone people up and when the receptionist asked me where I was calling from, my answer was, “Um, my living room.”For the first time in my le I wasn’t being defined by my business or my job title.The same will surely be true for Andy when he can no longer say that he is an international tennis player.The dficulty for professional sportspeople on retiring is that, suddenly, everything you have been geared up towards and focusing on is not there any more. There is nothing so harsh as the realisation that you are no longer relevant.I’ve seen this happen to a lot of footballers.One day you are a revered player for a Premier League club where everything is done for you. The next you are on your own, trying to make your way in a not-always-friendly world.In my view, people who cope are those who look forward not back. They look at what is happening in the next chapter, rather than who they once were.Take John McEnroe who is a hugely successful TV pundit and author. He has capitalised on his success – and shared it. And I have a feeling that, when the pain subsides, Andy Murray will do the same.HAS anyone  noticed how many news stories at the moment seem to be about people carrying and using a machete Why on earth would anyone need to carry a machete in England  We don’t live in a jungle, although it might feel like it at times.The only way to stop this epidemic is to pass a law prohibiting the ownership of this type of weapon.Anyone selling them on the internet for dispatch to this country needs to be issued with a UK arrest warrant and prosecuted.NOT quite sure what is motivating everyone to take part in the so-called “Ten-Year Challenge” – where you upload a photo of yourself from ten years ago to social media, together with a recent one, we’ve mocked one up for Adele.The only possible reason to do this, as far as I can see, is to say: “Haven’t I aged well ”I like a challenge . . . but this one’s not for me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If only he took such an uncompromising stance towards terrorists and despots. In reality, Jeremy Corbyn has no idea what Labour’s policy on Brexit would be.The path ahead is set in law. The UK will leave the EU in  days’ time — preferably with a deal,not on World Trade Organisation terms.  If Labour wants to reverse that legislation, it will require government backing — and the PM has made clear she won’t support it.The EU has asked to hear what alternatives the UK would accept. So this is a moment of truth, a test for the EU. Are they serious about a deal The Government must seek two essential changes. First, a mechanism so we can exit from the backstop — an interim regime of rules.Otherwise we risk being stuck in an indefinite limbo of laws, with no UK say over them.Second, we want a future relationship based on a free trade agreement so we are free to strike deals with other countries, from Latin America to Asia, to create jobs and cut prices in UK shops.If the EU won’t budge, we should keep our pledge to leave on WTO terms. That way, we can mitigate the risks of some short-term disruption.Dissident MPs are firing blanks. The Norway option means more concessions, including giving up UK control over immigration.A second referendum would create more uncertainty, the last thing business wants, and trigger a backlash from the majority who would feel cheated by the rejection of the  result. Pushing back the exit date would just prolong the anguish of this tortuous haggle with Brussels.None look capable of ­mustering support from a majority of MPs. I am struck by how many Remain voters — let alone Leavers — now just want to see Brexit done.It’s time for politicians to re-focus on boosting jobs, easing the cost of living and ensuring high-quality schools and NHS services. But the British people won’t move on from Brexit until their ­politicians keep their promises on Brexit.We’ve argued long enough. It’s time for some national self-belief.  People heard the risks and, yes, we need to manage them. But voters also expect their politicians to offer a more optimistic vision of post-Brexit Britain and grasp the opportunities.We will control our laws and our immigration policy. We will continue to trade in Europe, but broaden our global horizons — which is good for creating jobs, boosting wages, and offering UK consumers cheaper goods and wider choice.We should put rocket boosters up the economy by cutting business taxes and raise the threshold of National Insurance employee contributions to save workers more than £ each year.While we’re at it, a more robust pro-competition policy at home would give small businesses the opportunity to break into markets, end consumer rip-offs and offer customers better deals.Enough wrangling.

The Borough of Culture is about inspiring people who might not have considered a career in the arts and unlocking their potential.“The Borough of Culture also forms part of the Mayor’s work to tackle the root causes of violent crime, as it will create cultural activities specically designed to be easily accessible to disadvantaged young Londoners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463397365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sob stories ruined sas who dares wins","story":"A political decision that was clearly designed to distract voters and get an easy round of applause.Two things that were never going to stop Channel  enforcing the same rules at its own brilliant version of selection, SAS: Who Dares Wins, evenit was the last show on television that needed any fixing.Its three series have been close to works of art, in fact, largely thanks to their breathtaking settings and four instructors, Ant Middleton, Jason Fox, Matthew Ollerton and Mark Billingham, who gave it such an air of authenticity you could suspend disbelief and imagine you were watching the real thing.As the show’s introduction would have it, though, everything’s changed and they’re a band of brothers no more.The fourth run has  female recruits including a mole called Petra who’s served, for nine years, with Swedish Special forces, on their “front line”.A place which — full ignorant disclosure — I didn’t think extended much beyond the first day of Ikea’s January sales when it all kicks off on Malmo High Street, but actually involved several tours of Afghanistan.Her job here was to spy on all the contestants, and Petra’s certainly done a better job than the production team, because I’ve been watching it for three weeks and can only name three men.First to show, in Chile, was a Muslim called Qash, who voluntarily withdrew after discovering he’d have to share bathroom facilities with the women .  There’s also been no avoiding mentally fragile Nathaniel, or Milo, who’s so camp he makes Alan Carr sound like Lee Marvin.The rest of the  blokes, though, have just become anonymous blips on the horizon while the camera fixates on the women.Among their favourites have been: Saranya, who became the first candidate ever to shout “WHEEEEEEEEEE!” during the ft abseil, tattooed Tracey, blunt Aberdonian Lou, with the voice that goes through you like a rusty bayonet, and television natural Louise, who was the only woman bold enough to challenge a man in the boxing round, and suffered an uncomfortable beating for her troubles.Standards y, but the brutal, straight-down-the-line approach of the four instructors rarely wavers on screen, no matter the gender or how much noise they make.“You having a baby ”“No staff.”“Then shut the f*** up.”This is why you’d probably trust Ant Middleton and the other three with your lives.Politicians and TV people, on the other hand, I trust about as far as I could piggy-back them up the Andes.Almost no encouragement is needed, butyou give them any they will try to reduce every show on TV to one long procession of box-ticking contestants with a crowd-pleasing, right-on ­conclusion.That’s why the most over-worked recruit on this series is the pianist on sob story duties.It may always have had an element of this, of course, but the point when the scales really fell from my eyes was Sunday’s voluntary withdrawal of Nathaniel, who left a letter for the other weeping recruits announcing: “This is just the start of my journey.”You wish him well, obviously, but use of the dreaded J-word wasn’t just the moment I could no longer suspend disbelief, it was also the moment I started to think television was turning SAS selection into Bootcamp on The X Factor.Andthat’s the case, Channel  can have my badge. I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals. Gentlemen, it transpires, no longer prefer blondes.They can’t  stand them, in fact.QUIZ show doughballs of the week. The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The Burger And The King is a documentary about which singer’s eating habits ”Gianluca: “Billie Jean King.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “If I meow, what animal am I ”Poppy: “A goat.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an  poem, what season of the year does Keats describe as ‘the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Joe Lycett: “The fictional Champion the Wonder Horse is actually a what ”Ben: “A zebra.”. THIS Morning handover of the week. Holly Willoughby: “Love against the odds is the subject of the phone-in today. Vanessa Feltz, what kind of calls are you hoping for today ”“We’re looking for calls from people who think their love is against the odds.”And that’s why it’s about to win a National Television Award for the ninth year in a row. ANOTHER week brings another incompatible pair of reality TV gimps, with an E title that also sounds suspiciously like their viewing figures.Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, about Matthews and Williams of that ilk, which is based  on the classic misapprehension of every first-time parent: The world is simply full of people who give the slightest toss about their newborn.It’s not. Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV. BBC’s Revolution In Ruins: The Hugo Chavez Story detailing exactly how socialism, with Jeremy Corbyn’s connivance, destroyed Venezuela, the most oil-rich country in South America.Sky Atlantic repeating series one of The Sopranos.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its true purpose is to buy time to kill Brexit.Mrs May is still set on the one sensible course: to persuade the EU to tweak the deal and try for a Commons majority.If Remainers defeat it we are in  dangerous waters, as the PM has a duty to point out.ALL along, our negotiations have been let down by defeatism and naivety.Theresa May’s Remainer envoy Olly Robbins was outsmarted at every turn.Even now, as the PM suggests ing to Brussels to amend the backstop, Robbins texts another Eeyore — Philip Hammond — to say it isn’t worth it.Which is why replacing him immediately with hard-bitten Kiwi trade negotiator Crawford Falconer makes sense.Put a pro in charge.NOW Brussels admits it WILL build a hard border in Irelandthe deal is defeated.Marvel at their folly, and Irish PM Leo Varadkar’s. Their solution to avoid the border was so  tough on Britain that they could end up with one much faster.The answer is obvious. Time-limit the backstop to win over the Commons.Then focus every effort on technology to solve the problem before that deadline.CHAOS aside, our economy surges ahead.More in work than ever. The lowest unemployment in  years. Pay up . per cent, inflation at just . per cent.It makes mugs of those who forecast  immediate meltdownwe voted Leave.

If the man the Toyota driver hit hadnt have been an ex-racing driver, I think it could have been much worse.I noticed him in a split-second in the rear-view mirror, then the next thing I know hes in front of me. He was so quick. He came flying out of nowhere.It looks like he was trying to fly past them, but the guy in the red car had pulled into the lane he was in.The driver was an ex-race car driver, but the guy was going so fast so he didnt see him properly until he was there.He probably checked the mirror, seen nothing in and pulled out.Instead of just slamming on his brakes, the Toyota tried to cut in front of him again.As Aston approached the scene, he saw Len and his we were luckily uninjured, however the passenger door was so damaged she wasnt able to get out.Aston said: The couple he hit must have been in their sixties and luckily they were physically unharmed - just shaken up.The wheel arch was smashed up, there was damage to the passenger door which couldnt be open to get his we out.It was still drivable though because we followed the guy and tried to find him. He sped off.I was surprised that the guy managed to control the car and not end up in a ditch on the side of the road.[Len] did really well to control the car and not tip it over. He didnt actually hit the other car - I dont know how. He must have just skimmed it.The driver of that other car on the left chased him down with us because he was so angry he nearly hit him too.After ensuring the couple were safe, Aston and the driver of another vehicle that was narrowly missed followed the Toyota, finding the owner hiding at a nearby car wash.According to Aston, the reckless driver tried to blame the older couple for the collision and refused to admit fault.Aston said: He got away from us, but we knew the direction he went and saw his car hidden at a car wash.I got out my car and luckily he wasnt aggressive, but he was blaming Len in the red car.He said you see him hit me  you see him hit me I couldnt believe that hed driven like that then tried to blame the elderly couple. He wasnt sorry at all for it.He could have killed him and not known because hed sped ahead.Aston spoke to the Ford Fiesta driver after the crash to send him footage of the incident and claims he was told the police were not investigating as no-one was injured or killed.However Kent Police have now come back to confirm officers are looking into the crash.Aston said: The police are looking into it but they werent interested in first place because no-one was injured or killed.Theres been a few crashes on that bridge - its quite a steep cross-over. A quite famous one was a -car pile-up five years ago.They have an average speed camera but I think a lot of people assume theyre not turned on or working because Ive seen loads of people speeding.That whole stretch people drive really fast.A spokesperson for Kent Police said: Kent Police is investigating a collision which is reported to have taken place on the Sheppey Crossing on the afternoon on Monday  January .The incident is reported to have involved three vehicles and no injuries were reported.Officers are conducting ongoing enquiries to establish the full circumstances."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463730147.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"funny photos lifes most annoying moments","story":"As this excruciating gallery shows, whats annoying will only make you stronger.

They are concerned that Brexit may not happen at all because of the machinations of hardcore Remainers that has focused minds.”Mr Wilson’s comments mark a softening of the DUP’s position on the backstop after previously demanding it be removed from the Withdrawal altogether.The unionist party has opposed the backstop because it would mean Northern Ireland is treated dferently than the rest of the UK - effectively putting a border down the Irish Sea.And it signals a split with the hardline Brexiteer ERG group of around  Tory MPs, who last night said that inserting an end date in the Withdrawal Agreement would still not be enough to win over their support.Spelling out the changes needed to win the DUP’s support, Mr Wilson told The Sun: “If the Government says ‘we have got the Withdrawal Agreement changed, we now have a time-limit, that time limit is a legal guarantee which when we reach December  - or whenever it happens to be - the backstop will no longer apply and nobody can change that, it won’t require anybody ’s consent to be applied, then yes - that would be something that we would certainly be prepared to look at.”But ERG chief Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “I don’t think a time limit would be enough.

putting the ball in Brussels court.CORBYN - MORE FUDGELast night Jeremy Corbyn and his frontbench allies tabled an amendment laying out Labours policy.The non-binding motion would see Britain seek to reopen the withdrawal agreement - something the EU insists is impossible.It also suggests that the Government should allow MPs to vote on whether or not to back a second referendum.BENN - NONSTOP VOTESSenior backbencher Hilary Benn wants ministers to stage a series of indicative votes on what to do next.That would allow MPs to have their say on their preferred outcome -

It is hard-nosed realism.Signicantly, it bears the ­signature of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as Germany’s next Chancellor.Her appeal can be seen as a rebuke to Mrs Merkel, who rejected David Cameron’s plea for help to curb immigration, tipping ­Britain towards Brexit.Brits might have chosen dferentlyshe had responded to voters’ dismay not just in Britain but across the EU.She later signed her own political death warrant by flinging open Europe’s borders to a million Syrian migrants.But voters’ resentment towards arrogant EU leaders — recorded by their own Eurostat polling system — long predates immigration.Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron recently admitted he had dared not offer his voters a “Frexit”  ­referendum — because they would leave in a flash.Weeks later, his fears were confirmed as “yellow-vest” anarchists set Paris ablaze.French observers believe the gilets jaunes riots have their origins in another referendum crisis.In , France voted overwhelmingly against the European Constitution — only to see it renamed the Lisbon Treaty and slyly introduced against their express wishes.The European Constitution, like the disastrous euro, was a crucial but unpopular step towards a federal European superstate.Ireland and ­Denmark have also voted down EU moves to ever-closer union.They were told to vote again until they said Yes.Brussels’ arrogant contempt for ordinary voters — dismissed by one French president as “scum” — is what politicians blithely describe as the “democratic deficit”.It sowed the seeds for Brexit. Immigration simply brought it to a head.Germany’s letter to The Times reads like a plea from a deserted lover.“Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today — a community defined by freedom and ­prosperity,” writes Germany’s next Chancellor.“Should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe.”This is precisely what British voters hoped for as they ­teetered on the brink of Remain but opted to Leave.They wanted a civilised orce between economic and diplomatic allies.This is still possiblethe border issue can be resolved.If we can persuade the IRA to decommission deadly weapons, surely we can decommission a backstop that nobody wants Theresa May’s rejected deal is not a total failure. Without this problem it could still fly.Germany holds the key.If Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer means what she said about friendship, now is the time to prove it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Neil Basu warned officers have been working very hard to ensure there is not a far-right drt into extreme right-wing terrorism. The Met Police Assistant Commissioner said of  terror plots foiled in Britain since ,  were Islamist but four were far-right. He told the BBC: We saw a spike in hate crime after the referendum, thats never really receded. So theres always a possibility people are being radicalised by the kind of febrile atmosphere weve got at the moment.   We want people to report anything that we think is going to lead to violent confrontation. People need to calm down and understand that we are paying very close attention to that and we will stop it wherever we see it. It comes after Mr Basu said yesterday he finds the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on March  incredibly concerning. The senior officer said losing access to shared data and intelligence systems would put the UK and Europe in a very bad place. He said yesterday: For counter-terrorism we have a lot of bilateral relationships, it is a devolved power for countries, it is not an EU power, so we are confident that my counterparts in those  countries want to exchange information with us and we are working very hard to make sure we put that in place.   But nevertheless, to leave without ... being able to exchange data or biometrics on people who might be criminals or terrorists would be a very bad place for this country, and for Europe, to be. Mr Basu said there was a central team working on contingency plans, while counter-terrorism police liaison officers were embedded in embassies and agencies in Europe. He said: They are working very hard with their counterparts to understand how we copethere is a no-deal Brexit, but as I said, a no-deal Brexit for operational security would be a very bad thing. Mr Basu said there was no intelligence pointing to an increased level of attacks after Brexit, but he was concerned about a potential rise in hate crime. He said: Whats most concerning me about Brexit is its potential to ide communities and set communities against each other. So what we saw after the referendumwas a rise in hate crime, and a rise in far-right rhetoric, and we have seen the growth of organisations like National Action, and what I want to make absolutely clear is that we are concentrating very heavily on making sure that doesnt get a foothold in this country.  Im really proud to be a UK citizen in a country that is largely tolerant, and we havent seen an explosion in that threat. What Im concerned about is the creeping rise of that threat, andwe arent clear that we are combating that threat then thats my concern. Mr Basu was speaking yesterday at the launch of a major cinema advert campaign to increase awareness of suspicious activity and encourage people to report it to police. The -second film shows a series of scenarios, such as a man stockpiling hazardous material and another buying weapons, before rewinding and zooming in on the danger. In  and , around a fth of the information passed to police from the public had a signicant role in thwarting attacks, he said. Four far-right extremist plots and  Islamist terror plots were foiled in the last two years.

Butit isnt, the ardent pro-Remain millionaire said, there would be dire consequences. The gun is held to the British economy’s head, he told the BBC.   Russian roulette is a game which obviously you should never play, in which there’s a one-in-six chance that the bullet goes into your head.

After becoming a newspaper editor, he sparked fury by telling pals he wouldnt rest until Theresa May was chopped up in bags in my freezer. Mr Osborne spoke as Labour looked set to back a Parliamentary move that could delay Brexit and block No Deal. He added: I think at the moment delay looks like the most likely option because at least that gives some space to explore whether theres an alternative deal on the table. I doubt there is, but thats worth exploring, or whether we need to resolve this through a referendum.

A Tory former minister fired the broadside at his Conservative colleague amid mounting anger at the military manpower shortage. A poundmillion privatisation deal signed in  with outsourcing giant Capita - dubbed “Cra*ita” at the CommonsDefenceCommittee - has fuelled a , troop shortfall.  Mr Williamson was also tackled over the Mirror’s revelations a third of RAF planes are not available for frontline operations, having been sent into the air force’s sustainment fleet. Confronting the Cabinet Minister over Army recruitment, ex-Armed Forces Minister Mark Francois claimed the crisis was “clearly going north not south”. He told Mr Williamson: “You are quite decisive as Secretary of State. “What the committee can’t understand is why on this particular issue you’re like a rabbit in the headlights. “It keeps getting worse and worse and worse, you keep threatening to do something about it but you don’t.”  Mr Williamson said he was “increasingly confident” Army recruitment targets would be hit in the next financial year. But he warned: “We have started to see a turnaround in the number of recruits. “If it doesn’t continue in that direction ... they will have to be relieved of their contract and we will have to look at other ways in order to deliver it.” A Capita spokesman previously said both the firm and the Army under-estimated the complexity of the project.  “Our focus is now on working with the Army to deliver a recruitment process fit for the st Century,” he said. “We have overhauled governance on the contract and are already seeing improvements, with applications at a five-year high and a reduction in the amount of time it takes candidates to join the Army. “We are absolutely committed to getting this partnership right.” Mr Williamson was also grilled about the Mirror’s story about scores of RAF planes mothballed or in long-term maintenance. Labour MP Phil Wilson told him: “You can understand people’s concerns that a third of the fleet have been mothballed or are not ready to fly.”  TheDefenceSecretary hit back: “All planes go in for routine maintenance. But the availability of resource is not something we have seen degraded.” Deputy Chief ofDefenceStaff Air Marshal Richard Knighton insisted: “Complex fighter aircraft require routine maintenance in order to ensure that you prevent any problems with them, and to continue to make sure they are updated. “At any moment we will have a number of aircraft in maintenance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"martin lewis hurls papers air","story":"NewsMartin Lewis hurls his papers in the air in furious Brexit clash with top ToryA Brexit question  Not being answered  By a Tory minister  Truly, Martin Lewis frustration spoke for a nationShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video martin-lewis-throws-papers-air-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTruly Martin Lewis spoke for a nation.Fed up with a minister not answering a question on Brexit , the money saving expert hurled his papers in the air on live TV.The unfortunate Tory meeting the popular TV gurus wrath was Universities Minister Chris Skidmore.

It is one strand of the Governments multi-pronged national counter-terrorism programme, which is known as Contest and dates back to , and provides support at an early stage to ert at-risk iniduals away fromterrorism.Labour said the review came after a long-running campaign by the party.Nick Thomas-Symonds, Shadow Minister for Security, said: This review is surely an acceptance that many have lost faith in Prevent.   Various communities, academics and senior officials have all criticised the government for its poor implementation of the strategy. “The aims of safeguarding, gathering information, and community cohesion have not always sat easily together. Nor can we expect local services, continually cut back by Tory austerity, to deliver the welfare community facilities we need without appropriate funding. It is now crucial that this review is wide-ranging and robust.” Security minister Ben Wallace said: I have decided that the time is now right to initiate a review ofPrevent. Communities across the country have got behind the policy and are contributing to it because they want, as we do, their own young people to be protected from grooming and exploitation byterrorists.  Over the last two years the Home Office has built on the solid work ofPreventby releasing annual statistics. They clearly show thatPreventis not about singling out any particular group or ideology but is similar to other forms of safeguarding, carried out every day by social workers, teachers and police. The Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the review, with secretary general Harun Khan saying: For far too long, thePreventstrategy has affected the lives of innocent families, been criticised for mainstreaming discrimination and lost the trust of communities around the UK.

Frances Road in Erdington, Birmingham, sees drugs being handed out like sweets while one victim was left bleeding after being attacked with a crowbar. Locals living in some of the  properties on the road say their living in constant fear and pictures and videos show the scale of the problem. The street is blighted by late-night fights and residents are extremely concerned about the level of drugs in the area. Footage even shows a man breathing and swallowing fire on the blighted street.   Erdington MP Jack Dromey admitted Frances Road has been plagued by issues and said residents shouldnt be fearful of leaving their homes at night.Speaking to Birmingham Live, he said: Ive met with residents of Frances Road and we are now planning to revisit the concerns, which have been ongoing for the last two years.Theres real concern and bitterness. For example, a woman purchased her great-grandfathers house which her family had lived in for many years. Its a glorious tall building but now, due to problems outside her front door, shes too frightened to go out at night and even live in it.   She shouldnt be feeling like this. Another example was when I spoke to a mum. Her daughter has to get the bus on Slade Road and shes too scared to walk down the street and says: Mum, can you come with me and walk me to the bus stop . Residents once living in a fine area say its changing beyond recognition and its partly down to the rapid growth of HMOs. Theres proof of bad landlords operating here, packing vulnerable tenants into squalid conditions to make money and, as a result, theres been a rapid growth of anti-social behaviour and crime. The police and the council need to be given the priority to tackle bad landlords head-on and punish those who are bringing down this fine community.  I will ensure no stone is left unturned. Bad landlords need to be named and shamed. The area has a number of HMOs- properties transformed by private landlords into six or seven-bedroom homes used to house strangers. Housing charities operate on Frances Road too and provide social housing for the most vulnerable. One resident says he witnesses drugs being given out like sweets on a daily basis and wants police officers to take the area more seriously. Wanting to remain anonymous, he said: [Frances Road] has been like this for years. Drugs are done openly in the middle of the day, people come down the road and give them out like sweets. The amount of drunks here as well is unbelievable. Theres road signs tied to lampposts warning of fines but people are just lying there passed out. You want to see the place in the summer.  Its just the sheer lack of police, theyre not physically coming out and looking at the problems. I understand the cutbacks but its frightening around here. House prices are cheap and landlords are buying the big houses, transforming them into seven-bedroom flats. These HMOs are gold mines and theyre becoming out of control. Its full of p*** heads and druggies but nothing ever gets done and were the ones having to live with it, day in day out. Stockland Green councillor Josh Jones said a public meeting was held with residents on Frances Road in August , with another taking place to discuss issues highlighted at the Highcroft Community Centre on September . [Frances Road] is a big problem, Coun Jones admitted. The cuts to police budgets isnt helping matters. For example, when I became councillor a few years ago there was double the people power in terms of police numbers. Landlords are just taking money, both in terms of registered providers and those who own the properties.  Housing in Stockland Green is cheap, hence HMOs are cropping up. Theres a real issue with drugs and drug dealing in particular. Its leading to petty crime and these people should be getting the support they need. The vulnerable victims are easy prey for dealers, its that simple. We need to stamp it out completely and Im working alongside my colleague councillor Penny Holbrook and Jack Dromey. Police are struggling. Those linked to drugs are stashing drugs where and people arent forthcoming to give out information because they feel scared.  Addressing the issue of HMOs in Birmingham Jim Crawshaw, head of private sector housing, said those seeking to transform properties into a house for multiple occupation now need a proper licence - and standards must always be met. He said: In October last year, the law changed which meant that an estimated additional , landlords in Birmingham now need an HMO licence. We are working with landlords to ensure that all properties that are renting property in this way, meet the standards and regulations expected of them. Where these standards are not met, enforcement action will be used.

The Cha Cloisters building in west London has even been described as the ten floors of whores by people allegedly turning a blind eye to sex workers inside. Owned by millionaire Tory donor Christopher Moran, the building is said to house mainly Eastern European sex workers, according to an investigation by The Sun.The girls are reportedly now so comfortable with their set-up, they go for lunch in groups wearing pyjamas and stock up on sex supplies from nearby shops. The building hit headlines last year after it was revealed a police officer and his we were flying in prostitutes to work out of the flats. Ivett Szuda, , and her British husband Karl Ring, , were found guilty of trafficking and sexual exploitation. They used the Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air to fly women into London from Budapest as they made more than pound, from the vice trade.   During the investigation into the ongoing sex scandal, a reporter posing as a punter finds booking a girl inside the Cloisters building is quick and simple. He reports how a man answered with a greeting of: Always Escorts, how can I help  before arranging a meet-up. Inside the building, long hallways stretch into the distance, lined with apartments. After finding his room, he is greeted by a woman before the two discuss the agreed price of pound cash. She lies on the bed and is shocked to learn that he only wants to talk, before the undercover reporter goes on to ask questions about the sex operation inside the building. The Romanian woman, dressed in black lingerie, explains a booking agency takes a cut of all her fees, while she is still left to pay pound, a month in rent for her tiny studio. But, despite this, the woman claims she enjoys her lt inside the Cloisters building, telling the reporter: It is like a hotel, you know, so it is normal you pay more. Justyou rent a house it would be pound, per week in London. If you go outside of London it is very dferent.   The woman explains how she has been working as a sex worker in the building for two years after first coming to London and working as a waitress before being convinced by a friend to try prostitution. She says the Cloisters has a friendly atmosphere and that the girls all get on. The woman goes on to stress how she is not forced to work and that she does not have a pimp, but prefers to work with an agency because its more protected and the people who come are more nice. Despite the reported sordid activity that goes inside the Cloisters, normal families also share the building - living along prostitutes in neighbouring apartments. One woman told The Suns reporter how a man had knocked her door mistaking her home for a brothel. She said residents in the building see the ladies all the time and they are often dressed to kill and heavily made-up as they are spotted taking clients to their apartments in lts or getting into taxis for home calls. Property tycoon and owner of the building Moran reportedly makes a staggering poundmillion a year in revenue from rents and shyservice charges from the building. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, he is worth poundmillion. Moran has also given more than pound, to the Tory party.

Speaking during a visit to charity Family Action, in Lewisham, South London, Kate said: Its so hard. You get a lot of support as a mother particularly in the early days, but after the age of one it falls away. After that there isnt a huge amount - lots of books to read. Everybody experiences the same struggle. The Duchess of Cambridge was at the charity to officially launch FamilyLine - a new telephone, text and email service which allows parents and carers to access support when they need help. Kate previously spoke about the huge challenges of motherhood while delivering a speech at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists last year, reports the Mail.She said: Personally, becoming a mother has been such a rewarding and wonderful experience. However, at times it has also been a huge challenge - even for me who has support at home that most mothers do not. During yesterdays visit to the charity, Kate witnessed a role-playing training session for volunteers and staff. Sagari Sarkar, a volunteer who played a mum in need of support, said: I think it makes her human. It makes her in touch. She is a parent, a very active parent, and I think thats what people like about her.   The new charity helpline has been on a pilot trial for  months, before being launched nationwide. During her visit, the Duchess also met young people who are juggling school with caring for somebody at home. Praising them for their work, she said: You do an amazing job, I dont know how you do it.Yesterday, fashion fans were impressed by her sophisticated outfit choice, believed to be a modied version of a pound dress by Beulah London.As well as being a style hit, there is also a very important story behind the brand - and it is obvious why the Duchess has chosen to promote the company. It was set up by Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs and Lavinia Brennan after they took part in a volunteer mission in Delhi in .   They met women who had been trafficked into the sex trade and saw first hand how their lives had been torn apart. So they decided to combine their love of fashion with their new passion for the cause, and set up their own luxury womenswear brand with a social conscience. Their website states: In  we embarked on a volunteer mission in Delhi, helping transform the lives of vulnerable women who had been trafficked into the sex trade against their will. It proved to be a mission that would transform our lives too.

Twitter user Elizabeth Cotignola said: We need to talk about Meghan Markles new press secretary, sparking dozens of comments about the former government press officer.   Gigi wrote on Twitter: Press secretary is cute, while P Zapata wrote: What a hottie.

He previously worked in a number of roles for the British government, including Chief Press Officer for the Treasury between -, reports news.au.   He is also understood to have worked as a speech writer for the Department of Exiting the European Union. His appointment comes after a number of staff working for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were reportedly quitting their roles. Most recently, the -year-old Duchess was said to be gutted at losing her chief protection officer. The Scotland Yard inspector’s departure marked the third resignation among her senior aides in less than a year - signalling a worrying trend. Reports emerged last month that Meghan had been nicknamed Duchess Dficult’ by staff inside the palace walls, because of how demanding she can allegedly be. Meghan’s personal assistant, Melissa Touabti, walked-away from Kensington Palace last year after managing just six months in the position.   And private secretary, Samantha Cohen, is also rumoured to be leaving the Sussex’s workforce after more than  years of working for the Royal Family. According to The Sunday Times, there is nothing to suggest a personality clash between Meghan and the protection officer, but a source told the paper Markle’s desire to be seen as “one of the people” offers a number of challenges to her team. The female bodyguard has not been named publicly.

Though her next child Violet, , was born toothless, her last two babies, Scarlett, eight, and Logan, one, amazingly both had two bottom gnashers. Vicky, of Newbridge, south Wales, has still managed to breastfeed all of her brood. An expert says the phenomenon, known as natal teeth, happens to just one in  babies.  The stay-at-home mum, who is married to -year-old manufacturing supervisor Leigh, said: “I was actually born with teeth myself, but I can’t for the le of me work out why three of my four children had them too. “Violet will ask me, ‘Mum, why didn’t I have teeth ’ but I honestly don’t know. I don’t remember saying or doing anything dferently when I was pregnant with her. “When they were little, before the rest of their teeth came through, we’d get strangers stopping us to ask all the time.” When her eldest Demi-Leigh was first born back in August , Vicky did not initially realise she had two teeth. She continued: “I cuddled her, and put her on me for a feed, then screamed out as I felt a pain. “I said to the midwe, ‘I swear she’s just bitten me.’ “They told me that couldn’t be right, but once they checked her over, it was – she had two teeth.” Keen to carry on breastfeeding, as she saw it as a way of bonding with her newborn, Vicky persevered as best she could. But after around three months, she felt too sore, and so had to stop.   Then, two years later, in December  little Violet was born, this time with no teeth. So when Vicky fell pregnant once again in , she didn’t expect to welcome another toothy tot. But when her third child Scarlett was born that May, it was a dferent story. “She had two teeth, just like Demi-Leigh, but this time, they were on the bottom,” laughed Vicky. “This time, doctors said that they were a choking hazard and would need to be removed. “That was quite dficult to see, as she was only a few weeks old when it happened, and was crying away. Her mouth was bleeding for about an hour afterwards, too. “The dentist actually rang us again afterwards to make sure she was okay, as apparently she was the youngest baby he’d ever done a procedure on.” And, when Vicky gave birth to Logan in January , it was an all-too-familiar scene, as midwives crowded round once he’d arrived to look at his mouth – specically, the two prominent teeth in his bottom gum. This time, her newborn was allowed to keep his natal teeth as they did not pose a choking threat. As Vicky is not planning to have any more children, she vowed to breastfeed him for as long as possible, despite the pain it caused - and has only just stopped after a year.  “I don’t think I’ll have any other kids, so I wanted to enjoy him and give him all that motherly goodness and bonding for as long as I could,” she explained. “Breastfeeding a baby who has teeth is painful, especially when the teeth catch, but I have just learnt to push through and toughen up. I use a lanolin cream to soothe my skin too.” Adding that Logan’s unusual grin has seen him attract a lot of attention when he is out and about, she continued: “People see him smiling and stop us to say, ‘Does that baby have teeth ’ “He thinks it’s fun to bite down when he’s playing, too. I’ll see a little twinkle in his eye, then he’ll chomp away.“He used to do it on my nipple when I was breastfeeding.” Vicky also has a theory that, as three of the children already had gnashers, they found the teething process easier than other babies. She said: “They didn’t cry or fuss much at all. Violet did cry a little bit more, but she was still a calm baby.Weve been really lucky with them all.” Reflecting on her remarkable brood, Vicky added: I wonderit is something in our genes. Leigh was really shocked, as nobody on his side had seen a baby with teeth before.“I take photos all the time of Logan, and when I post them to Facebook, people are amazed.I never took any with the others, as it was the days before good camera phones, but now I wish I had.“I wondermy grandchildren will carry on the tradition and have teeth too.” Dr Guy Barwell, cofounder of The Implant Centre, said “It is very unusual for babies to be born with teeth, but it is a recognised form of tooth that is aptly named ‘the natal tooth’.“They are usually poorly formed, tiny and often have roots that are very limited so are quite loose in the gum. “The main issue is obviously with breastfeeding, and how much this would be affected.“They don’t replace the deciduous teeth that should still come through, but are an additional set.“The statistics suggest  in  babies may be formed with natal teeth.“In this case, there is a very obvious genetic linkmum and all three children all had the same surprise.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum pregnant twins one rule","story":"NewsMum pregnant with twins has one rule for babies birth - but not everyone agreesThe woman took to blog Mumsnet to ask for advice, but the opinions she received were idedShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe mum reached out to people on a blog\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mother who is pregnant with twins has a simple rule for after the birth - but her request has ided opinions.The woman, writing on blog Mumsnet, said shes having twin girls after sadly losing a baby girl last January.Her babies are due next month, but she doesnt want any visitors for a whole month.She wants it to just be her, her husband, her two boys, and the twins together for the first four weeks.But the mum asked for peoples opinions as to whether it was fair to exclude extended family and friends.Some felt it was her choice to have whoever she wanted - or didnt want - present, but others disagreed.

Another agreed, saying: Its an exciting time, expecting your twins so soon. I can well understand you dont want visitors for a time.I didnt like having them very much, I wanted peace!But not everyone agreed, and some thought that it was unfair to exclude other family members who would want to be part of the birth. A user called cantchooseyourfamily said: Sorry to hear about your loss. I do think its unfair to extended family who I assume are excited about the arrival Could you not just be a bit stricter with times when you are free for visitors My children are still very young but I know I would be very upset to be banned from meeting future grandchildren for a month after their birth.

Her parents had tried to get in contact with the estate agent over the weekend and Shannon said she was told a plumber would finally be round on Monday. As a result of having no heating or hot water, the mother said she was forced to go round to her parents house in order to wash her sons, two-year-old Azaan and nine-month old Sahil.   She also said she was forced to sleep three in a bed for four nights, while using an electric blanket in order to stay warm, because every room in the house was freezing. Shannon said: On Friday the boiler in my house started leaking and producing a strange burning smell, before it stopped working. I immediately rang Ashton Estates to ask them to come round and fix the boiler, as I have two very young sons who I cannot keep in a freezing house, and they told me that a plumber would be round to fix it. Come pm nobody had arrived, so I began to ring the emergency number. I tried numerous times to get through but was unable and eventually the phone itself was turned off.   Over the weekend I tried to ring them again, and so did my parents, with us leaving a lot of voicemails asking them to come and fix the boiler. However nobody got back to us at all. We were then told that a plumber would be round on Monday, but still nobody showed up. Because of this I was forced to look after my children in a freezing house, and the only source of heat that we had was a broken radiator that probably isnt safe and an electric blanket. It takes the radiator about five hours to heat a room and both items use a lot of electricity. My children had to wash at my parents house. I just wanted someone to come round and fix our boiler, I have two infant sons and they shouldnt have to live like this.   A spokesperson from Ashton Estates said a plumber visited the property on Tuesday and managed to get the boiler working again but said the reason it had not been working was due to no gas being on the meter, a claim refuted by Shannon. Ashton Estates said: Our plumbers are very busy but managed to get round earlier today and the gas is now back on. We found the issue to be that there was no gas on the meter, although the plumber did not actually look at the meter itself. They have said that a notication on the boiler indicated to them that there was no gas. Shannon said she did have gas in the meter for the whole weekend, and that the plumber had told her that there was an issue with steam in the boiler and that was what caused it to break.

So we all know we should be avoiding all unnecessary travel during snow fall and taking extra care while out and about. But here some tips you might not know according to the Liverpool Echo .  DO NOT pour boiling water on your car windscreen Pouring hot water on your windscreen may seem like the quickest way to defrost it, especially in that early morning rush. But the rapid expansion and contraction of the ice as a result of the hot water could cause the screen to crack. Instead, turn on the engine and allow the air-conditioning to circulate around the car.  DO NOT leave your car unattended Owners who leave their engines running while they run inside to grab something they’ve forgotten are a car thief’s dream - and also breaking the law. Drivers have to be ‘in control’ of their vehicle at all times. If you need to go back into the house you should turn off the engine, lock the car and head in. Car insurers rarely pay outthe keys are left in the car.  DO NOT drive to normal road conditions Driving in snow and ice should not be taken for granted, no matter how little your area might have received. Black ice in particular has caused many accidents on roads where people thought they were clear to drive as normal. Leave plenty of time for all journeys and take extra time to get from A to B. Don’t forget to maintain safe stopping distances and use your fog lights accordingly.

Keep your hands and face warm -they get cold they can trigger a rise in blood pressure which puts you at increased risk of a heart attack. . Remember that several thin layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thick layer, as the layers trap warm air. . Wear warm clothes in bed.

Kaylah Merritt, who is just one year old, was hospitalised for four days last month after a relative kissed her on the lips while they had a cold sore. She soon developed an awful purple rash all over her body and was left crying in pain. Her parents Brogan Thomas and Connor Merritt, both , rushed her to Darlington Memorial Hospital for emergency treatment.  Kaylah, from Staindrop, Darlington, County Durham, was diagnosed with Eczema Herpeticum, a viral infection caused by the herpes virus, and needed two rounds of antibiotics and several dferent creams to soothe her skin.Her parents are now urging adults to be aware of the risks kissing a baby on the mouth can bring after doctors said the tots experience could have been fatal.Stay-at-home mum-of-one Brogan said: Kaylah was crying so hard, I knew it could only mean she was in pain. We were at home and I was about to put her in the bath when I suddenly saw all the marks on her legs.It was an awful nightmare, there were purple rashes everywhere and Kaylah was sobbing her heart out.Eczema herpeticum is an infection usually caused by the herpes simplex  virus, which is usually responsible for the appearance of cold sores on the mouth or other parts of the body.People with atopic dermatitis and other skin diseases are more prone to getting infected, and the condition is more common among infants and young children.Symptoms include blisters, high fever and swollen lymph glands and can be proven deadly in some cases.   I was terried, my first thought was it had something to do with meningitis because she had it before.My fiance was petried, but he kept me calm and made sure Kaylah was calm too.I instantly knew we had to take her to the hospital.The doctors told us that someone with a cold sore must have kissed her on the lips and because babies immune systems are not strong enough, she developed the rash.When the doctors told me how dangerous it was I cried and cried thinking how I could have lost her due to a silly kiss.Connor was shocked and couldnt believe all this was down to a kiss too.If we hadnt gone to the hospital quickly, it could have been very dangerous, we could have lost her.I was so relieved when Kaylah was out of danger.Kaylah previously survived meningitis and needed a lumbar puncture to survive.This time, doctors told her parents the Eczema Herpeticum could have been very dangerous so it was lucky she was brought into hospital when she was.Kaylah was able to go back home after four days on a ward but her parents said she still hasnt fully recovered. Even a month later, she still needs to take daily medication until the virus is gone and must attend doctors appointments on a weekly basis.Brogan said: I am over the moon Kaylahs home now and enjoying herself with her toys and extra cuddles.I just want other parents to know, you dont have to be a physically ill to harm a baby - you can just be a carrier of the virus and still affect them."},{"url":null,"title":"woman allergic cold wears face","story":"NewsWoman allergic to cold wears face mask in case temperature drop kills herEvenMax Fisher, , of Nottingham drinks a cool drink she comes out in red, itchy hives and her throat closes upShareCommentsByLaura ForsythArun Lal:,  JAN NewsShe also wants to raise awareness after she suffered abuse in the street due to wearing a mask \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who is allergic to cold needs to wear a face mask outdoors in case a drop in temperature sparks a deadly reaction. Max Fisher, , says she has been diagnosed cold-induced urticaria which can kill sufferers in extreme cases. Those who suffer an allergic reaction will go into anaphylactic shock - much likethey were to suffer a bee sting or eat peanuts. And it isnt just winter temperatures that could set Max off. From inhaling cold air or sipping a cool drink she comes out in red, itchy hives and her throat closes up. The pharmacology graduate is raising awareness about the condition ahead of the expected cold snap. Max, of Sherwood, Nottingham, said: “Im allergic to the cold so Im basically allergic to winter.   “I was diagnosed with a conditional called urticaria in . “I wear a face mask outdoors to prevent a reaction. “The symptoms are mostly an urticarial rash, big swollen, hot and very itchy. “If I breathe in cold air, I get wheezy, so when I put the mask on it’s coming through slightly warmed material. “That mixes with the warm air that I have just breathed out – so it takes the edge of any cold that is out there.  “I was quite an outdoorsy person before I was diagnosed with the condition. “I used to go to car shows with my dad all the time. “I would just do typical kid stuff like running around and climbing trees. “I would love itmore people were aware of urticaria. “People wear masks for all sorts of reasons. “When I wear the mask people stare and I get abuse in the street sometimes.   “Sometimes I don’t want to deal with that just to go to the shops and get a bag of crisps from the shop. “I live with chronic pain and sometimes I use a walking stick or a wheelchair. “Trying to find work is just such a struggle. “It’s so frustrating – I’ve worked really hard – I have a Master’s degree in pharmacology. “I’ve done all of this hard-work and put myself out there and employers are just ‘ah wheelchair’.  “I was really nervous at first, to be like I can get out of the wheelchair, I can walk a little bit. “So I don’t have to be in a box of can’t or can walk. “Disabled people exist and some of us wear masks, some of us use wheelchairs, some of us use walking sticks. “I definitely want people with disabilities to just be accepted.” Cold-induced urticaria is an auto-immune disease, which causes her to break out in hives which burn and itch, and can spread across her entire body, ying in size.   But it’s not as simple as moving to a warm country, as in the summer ice in her drink causes her fingers to swell, opening a fridge or freezer, jumping into a pool or a breeze can chill her, causing a reaction. Max first experienced a breakout when she was , when she developed breathing dficulties after sitting on wet grass in the summer. But her symptoms were mistaken for a pollen allergy for the several weeks, and she claims even now some medical professionals don’t understand her condition. She said: “It was a summer’s day and I just sat down on the wet grass and suddenly started wheezing and struggling to breathe.  “I got an itchy red rash all over my arms and I had no idea what was going on. “Initially doctors thought it was a pollen allergy but further tests revealed it was urticaria. “Apparently the wet grass on my skin cooled it so much that it triggered the reaction. “It’s scary when it happens because I don’t knowmy throat will close up completely but now I take antihistamines every day just in case I suffer another reaction. “The summer is just as bad as the winter and I’ve come out in hives after walking into an air-conditioned room before. “As long as I’m of a constant, medium temperature with no sudden drops in the temperature I’m ok but it is a daily battle.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman live streamed herself crying","story":"NewsWoman live-streamed herself crying for help during club dancefloor sex assaultThe clubber uploaded several videos to Facebook of the alleged sexual assault in Opera nightclub, AtlantaShareCommentsByToby Meyjes:,  JAN NewsFive videos were uploaded to Facebook in total \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman live-streamed herself screaming for help as she was allegedly sexually assaulted on a nightclub dance floor.

Carolyn Kerr runs a takeaway called The Battered We and defended the name after she faced complaints from around the world and boycott threats. Ms Kerr insisted that her shop raised awareness about family violence - but critics called her a clown and said the name was making a joke of violence against women. The former police officer decided to close her shop in Innisfail, Australia, claiming a campaign against her saw people fabricate complaints to government agencies and threaten to toss bricks through the window.   According to Ms Kerr, who said she had been a victim of domestic violence, the final straw was a planned audit of staff wages after anonymous complaints to Australias Department of Fair Work. She said her insurance doesnt cover it and she cannot afford to cover the cost on her own. In a video posted on Face, Ms Kerr announced that she was selling her shop, adding: As many of you know Ive been the subject of an abusive witch hunt by a not-for-profit organisation who are anti-abuse.  However, theyve threatened to throw bricks through my window, theyve complained to ASIC [Australian Securities and Investments Commission] to have my business name revoked.Then they complained to Industrial Relations and Child Protective Services ... saying that I was employing kids and I was participating in child exploitation. Someone later launched a GoFundMe page to try to help Ms Kerr keep her shop open, raising , Australian dollarsso far. Amid the controversy last year, Ms Kerr said of the name: I batter fish, Im married to my business and I want to make a dference.  The Red Heart Campaign, meanwhile, has denied harassing Ms Kerr and her shop, and denied allegations it reported her to government agencies or encouraged people to abuse her. In October last year, the anti-violence group criticised The Battered We, writing on Facebook: We would like to send a huge f*** you to The Battered We Fish  Chip shop in Innisfail, Queensland. In a year where we have lost  women and  kids to murder and manslaughter, and while hundreds of thousands of women are being battered by their partners across the country, these clowns thought it appropriate to make a joke out of domestic violence.  There is nothing funny about domestic violence or violence against women. Please boycott this business - it does not deserve your money. Amid the uproar, those who were angry over the shops name described it as totally insensitive and very inappropriate. Group founder Sherele Moody wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday: The Red Heart Campaign is in no way responsible for the closure of the Battered We Fish and Chip Shop.  She said other groups and Australian MPs also criticised the shops name, and there was already opposition to it before her group condemned the name. Ms Moody said she had received thousands of threats and abusive messages after The Battered We announced it was closing, and claimed people tried to hack her social media accounts and set up fake profiles. In a follow-up post, Ms Kerr posted screen grabs of previous posts by the Red Heart Campaign, writing: Sherele this is abuse! Ms Kerr also thanked her supporters and urged people not to socially abuse the Red Heart Campaign, adding it just keeps this horrible cycle going. The Battered We, which opened in , will close next Monday, Ms Kerr said.

The eerie development of  faux-gothic villas in northern Turkey was built in an attempt to attract Arab buyers. But only  of the homes were sold, and after Turkey’s economy collapsed, the place was abandoned. It’s not the only abandoned place which is as fascinating as it is spooky.From the crumbling buildings that once served as a Soviet-era spa resort to the abandoned and overground theme park in Japan which was once expected to rival Disneyland, Mirror takes a look at some of the best.  Haunting photos revealed a once-thriving spa town famous for is thermal springs abandoned and in ruins.The waters of immortality bubbling up from the ground in Tskaltubo, in west-central Georgia, were believed to possess healing properties for more than a thousand years. One bathing house in the town was even built exclusively for Joseph Stalin. But after the USSR collapsed in the early s, the stream of socialist visitors started to dry up and the once grand buildings were left to be reclaimed by time and nature.  Eerie images taken by photographer Roman Robroek show deserted arcades with columns topped by crumbling turquoise arches - that open onto balconies with views of the woods beyond.And wide stone staircases spiral down to the now empty bathing pools, where the ceramic tiles barely cling to the walls. Nara Dreamland, Japan Fascinating images recently captured the inside of an abandoned and overground theme park in Japan which was once expected to rival Disneyland. Nara Dreamland was built in , complete with fairytale castles, rollercoasters and other attractions. But the park struggled to compete when both Disney and Universal Studios opened up their own parts in nearby Osaka and Tokyo. The park was eventually closed in the summer of , but its attractions were left in place for over  years to rust and decay.  Photos revealed eerily quiet walkways, rollercoaster tracks choked by wild overgrowth, paint peeling off shabby attractions and twisted, rust metal where majestic water fountains once stood. After it closed it became a popular place for ‘haikyoists’ - a Japanese word meaning urban explorers, particularly those interested in ruined structures and landscapes. Houtouwan, China  Built on the steep hills of Shengshan Island, , fishermen once plied their trade in the village of Houtouwan in China. But thousands of inhabitants moved from the island, one of  islands on the Shengsi archipelago, in the early s, seeking better education, jobs and healthcare. They left only a small handful of residents still living there, and today even that group has dwindled to almost nobody.  Last year stunning pictures emerged from the village showing how it is being reclaimed by nature. Empty homes and other buildings in the once bustling community are now covered in green with some almost disappearing into the hills.

Fteen primary schools, a large hospital complex,  stores,  gyms, along with parks, cinemas, factories, pool, amusement park, and other marks of a thriving community. And it was all abandoned in just three hours when residents were told to leave.  Over three decades later, the ghost town is a freeze-frame of the Soviet Union in . Communist propaganda still hangs on walls, the hammer and sickle decorate lampposts awaiting May Day celebrations that never took place, and residents’ personal belongings litter the streets and abandoned buildings.

But after the Soviet Union fell in  the bunkers were sealed shut or demolished.One near Dundee, however, was preserved exactly how it was when it was last entered at least  years ago.  Explorers who recently entered the secret site for the first time found old pots and pans, mugs, and washing up liquid alongside official Cold War communications technology. The bunker, built ft under the ground, and housed two people when it was operational, still has the original desk, cabinets and bunk beds that would have been used by volunteers. Blankets were filmed rotting on the bunk bed exactly where they had been left decades ago, and there is even a candle holder with the remains of a burned-out candle stuck in the base.

Pavel Shapovalov, , demanded that the Moscow-bound Aeroflot plane was erted to Afghanistan. The forester - who ly boasted he had studied at Hard - was detained by special forces officers at Khanty-Mansiysk airport in Russia. He has been formally charged with hijacking. Initial reports had said the loner sought to storm the cockpit and was “armed” and “drunk” on a Boeing  flight from Surgut in Russia when he demanded the plane should reroute. Today it emerged he had no explosives or weapons, was entirely sober and - according to flight crew and passengers - made no attempt to reach the flight deck.   He sat quietly in his economy class seat a, summoning a stewardess to say he had an unidentied weapon and thathis orders were not obeyed “it will be bad for everybody”. The flight crew followed pre-set instructions and did not seek to overpower him amid fears he really was armed. On the Tarmac, the alleged hijacker even “fell asleep” as the crew waited for special forces to storm the aircraft. Senior stewardess Eva Kraichek said: “His speech was logical. There was no smell of alcohol.It looked like there was no drug intoxication either. This is why we took his words seriously.”   She said: “After landing, all that time were waiting for the special forces, he was looking out of the window. “We also told him that we would be refuelling so we had enough to fly to Afghanistan. “That is why he calmed down. He did not talk to anybody, just looked out of the window and fell asleep. During the flight he did not sleep, he claimed he has weapon, andwe did not fulfil his demands, he would use it and it will be bad for everybody - those were his words. “He did not show the weapon.” The captain had relayed a message to him that in order to refuel for the flight to Afghanistan, he would land at oil boomtown Khanty-Mansiysk. There was no panic among passengers who only discovered they had been “hijacked” from media reports when they turned on their smartphones after landing in the Siberian outpost.  When he was overpowered by special forces he made no attempt to resist, said the crew. None of the other  passengers and crew were hurt and they continued to Moscow on another aircraft sent by the airline. The man has no known terrorist connections and in his interrogation he was unable to explain why he had demanded the plane should fly to Afghanistan. “It seems to me, it is not as easy...as it seems at first sight,” he told his interrogator. Asked to confirm he had demanded the Russian plane flew to Afghanistan he replied: Yes. But honestly I did not need to fly there… Questioned on why he made the request, he was unable to answer. Tests showed no alcohol or drugs in his blood.  A medical examination showed traces of neither drugs nor psychotropic substances nor alcohol in Shapovalov’s blood, said Svetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative Committee. At the same time, given his inadequate behaviour on the flight and the gravity of the crime he committed, he will have to undergo a mental examination.” One former workmate called him a “loser” who often behaved strangely, while other said he found it hard to make friends. He was also called a fantasist. Shapovalov recently lost his job as a forestry worker in a nature reserve after ly claiming to be off work through sickness. He tried to sue the reserve for wrongful dismissal but lost when it was proved he was lying about a hospital stay. He frequently got into arguments with work colleagues, they say.  The man had been married and has a child, but lived with his mother for most of his le. A former colleague said: “I was shocked to hear that he hijacked the plane. “I did suspect that he was not all there - for example, he used to say he was educated at Hard. “But I did not think it was as bad as this.

The hardcore athletes are part of a special group of globe-trotting athletes who road-test the world’s toughest adventure races before they’re launched to the general public. In his day job Darren Grigas, , is a property investor from Peterborough while Allie Bailey is a -year-old freelance project manager from north London. But in their spare time they are hardcore race explorers. In the space of just three weeks late last year they completed a series of back-to-back ultra-marathons in locations that would put Bear Grylls to shame - while also bagging two world firsts in the process.   Their incredible excursions saw them making the first ever foot crossing of an uninhabited stretch of the Namib Desert, covering  miles in four days and ascending half the height of Everest. Just days later, they made they weer the first runners to take on the Panama Canal, trekking  miles in just a day and narrowly avoiding  ft long man-eating crocodiles. And they also found time to complete a ‘three peaks’ mountain challenge in South Africa while also spending a week dodging deadly snakes and spiders in the jungles of Central America. Darren and Allie are official ‘test pilots’ for UK firm Rat Race Adventure Sports.   Having pioneered these new routes, the races can now be launched as official events for paying punters. Darren - a dad-of-two who covered more than  miles on foot and ascended , ft in height in just  days - said: “Each of these inidual events are pretty epic on their own. “But doing them all back-to-back is something . “Typically, you’ll do one of these challenges, go home, and sleep for a week and eat as much as you can while feeling knackered.   “Instead we got on a  hour flight and did the same thing in a dferent location! “Being a Rat Race test pilot requires a certain amount of stamina, and it’s not for the faint hearted. But to go out to these locations and be the first to complete these routes is very, very special.” Allie took up running just a few years ago as a way to improve her mental health. Last year she became the first woman to run across the -mile long Khoumlvsgoumll Nuur frozen lake in Mongolia - braving temperatures as low as minus - ordmc - as part of her job as a Rat Race ambassador.  She said: “Completing these routes in Namibia, Panama and Mongolia really pushed us to the limits. “The jungles of Panama in particular were a real test of endurance for me. “But it’s part and parcel of being an adventure race test pilot. We’ve got to make sure these events are ‘doable’ before the general public is let loose on them. “And that often means running the gauntlet of dangerous animals, unassailable pathways and heat exhaustion.” On November , Darren and Allie - as well as Rat Race founder Jim Mee - set-off on a new -mile long journey into Namibia’s inhospitable Namib desert.  After four-and-a-half days negotiating ordmC heat and the world’s biggest sand dunes they racked-up , ft of ascent before arriving on the famous Skeleton Coast. This route will now become ‘Race to the Wreck’, with the first event taking place in November this year. Darren said: “The easiest way to describe what it’s like to climb these enormous sand dunes is to imagine going up an escalator the wrong way, in a heatwave, with tired legs.” Allie adds: “On the first day we set out at .am and it was already  degrees. Upon packing up camp we found two yellow scorpions had crawled under our groundsheets. We’d lucked out - they are very, very poisonous!”  On November  the team arrived in Cape Town to complete a ‘three peaks’ challenge, covering  miles and ,ft of ascent as Darren and Allie scaled Table Mountain, Signal Hill and Lions Head. Darren added: “It was a light run compared with what we’d just done in Namibia.” International flights then took Darren and the team to Panama, where on November th they embarked on a one day, full traverse of the famous Panama Canal on foot and via kayak - the first time such a trip has ever been done. It was on this -mile day-long journey they encountered massive crocodiles in the warm waters.  Darren said: “The most worrying part was seeing a ft long croc at the precise location where we had to get out of the kayaks and wade through shallow water to the start of the jungle. “I heard a snap - and it was a big one. We were in their prime hunting spot. The vegetation was just as nasty, too, covered in needles three inches long.” Just two days later the Rat Race test pilots then embarked on a km coast-to-coast crossing of western Panama, travelling from the Pacic shores in the south to the Caribbean in the north. They passed through pristine rainforest, which is home to jaguar, puma and howler monkey.  This mission was a real test for the group as they ascended , ft over six days and made their way over a dormant volcano. Darren was bitten by a mysterious spider and made what he called a “schoolboy error” of standing barefoot on his machete, running his heel down the blade on the very first day, suffering a deep wound to his foot which caused him pain from that moment on. They also had to dodge deadly snakes, including the fearsome The Fer-De-Lance, as well as coral snakes and tree vipers. Allie said: “All that separated us from the wildle was a thin net. One night it rained so hard my hammock slipped and I woke up on the floor, but I was just too exhausted to get up and re-erect it. I made a few new bug friends on the jungle floor that night” Darren added: “I’d never gone from event to event to event like this before, and I was really feeling it. We all were. “And we were out in the jungle on our own, where the only help we had was each other.” One member of the team suffered such extreme heat exhaustion as they neared the finish line he collapsed, just  metres from the exit point, sparking a medical emergency. Rat Race leader Jim, who was joined by partner Danielle Brodie in Namibia, said: “We’d ascended and descended the height of Everest, in extreme heat and really tricky conditions, while carrying heavy packs.  “One of the guys battled through everything that the jungle threw at him but simply collapsed on the last day. His body shut down, he couldn’t see properly and he lost the feeling in his legs. “We laid him down in a river and got him cooled down. It was pretty serious for a while, but we all work together to ensure the team can respond when someone needs help. “This whole trip was the toughest thing any of us had done.” If that sounds like enough adventure to last a letime, the Rat Race test pilots will soon be making their way to other far-flung locations to pioneer new ‘Bucket List’ events.

It’s too early at this stage to say who they are but they will be playing at Slessor Gardens some time between May and September.”It is the third year in a row the Liz Hobbs Group has been involved in organising gigs in Dundee, with plans for at least two more years’ worth of live music after this summer.But Liz said she would be happy to carry on beyond that, should the demand still be there.She said: “For us as a business it’s hugely expensive to develop a new venue and so at the outset at LHG we agreed to make a business commitment to the development of music in Dundee of five years.“We are now on year three and we’re delighted with the progress so far. I hope to bring further concerts to Dundee in the future.“In the early days no one could predict whether it would succeed, but there’s a buzz in the city.“Word is spreading among agents and acts and we are getting more and more interest from artists who would like to play here.”Liz added: “We are getting local people involved in other aspects by providing employment in areas such as security and being involved on the day.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c46e541c54979.47898500.jpg ","title":"dundee suited her and she suited it tributes to mcmanus registrar sally mcintosh 47","story":"Tributes have been paid to popular McManus galleries and museum registrar Sally McIntosh, who has died following a short illness aged .Sally had worked at the museum since , having first come to the city as a student in the s.Paying tribute, her brother-in-law Paul Thomson said: “She was extremely funny and had a very dry sense of humour.“She was really into music, particularly American indie bands.

It wasn’t good when we lost.“That feeling is one you don’t want again and results like that one just show you can’t take anything for granted.“Teams in Scotland in all the leagues have good players and,you don’t have the proper approach, you will have problems.”And Stanton expects Montrose to battle tooth and nail to cause a shock tomorrow but believes United will be ready to cope with that.“These are dficult games because you know one team is giving everything they can to beat you because they have that nothing-to-lose mentality about them.“I’ve been there myself in those cup-ties when I was with Dumbarton, where you play teams who are bigger than your club and you don’t normally play against.“It excites you and it’s a chance for you to show how good you are. It’s why,you’re the bigger team, you can never take these games for granted.”He believes the key to avoiding a shock is treating the opposition with the respect they deserve and working towards the tie asit was a big game.“We have prepared for this one like we do every other game and that makes sure you have the right attitude.“The manager has had his videos of Montrose and been telling us about their strengths and weaknesses.“That way you make sure you are going into the game with the right mentality.”And,promotion from the Championship this term is by far the No  goal, Stanton admits he would love to go as far as possible in the cup.“A cup run is always important for the supporters and we know that.“For the players as well, it’s nice to do well and, as a football club, it is always important that we go as far as we can in the cup.“It’s another game we want to win and,you can string some wins together in the league and add a cup run to that as well, it’s always a help.”Stanton is also well aware that a side story tomorrow will be Tangerines legend Sean Dillon coming up against them for the first time since he ended a -year stay at Tannadice in .He expects the man who won the cup with United in  to get a rousing welcome from Arabs but, once that is out of the way and the game kicks off, it will be business as usual.“Sean left before I arrived at United but I know what a good player he was for the club.“He was here a long time and I’m sure he will get a good reception from our fans who travel up there.“For us, it’s about making sure he’s not the one getting clapped off the pitch after the game has finished.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c45bd0ec386d0.62163534.jpg ","title":"jim mcintyre relieved as dundee remain in scottish cup","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre was relieved to still be in the Scottish Cup after his side scraped a draw with Queen of the South at Dens Park.Saturday’s fourth-round clash saw the Doonhamers deservedly move ahead through veteran striker Stephen Dobbie’s rd goal of the campaign.Although Jesse Curran struck a fine equaliser at the end of the first half, it was to prove the Dark Blues only shot on target over the  minutes.It was down to the heroics of debut keeper Seny Dieng, on loan from QPR for the rest of the season, that McIntyre’s men can look forward to a replay at Palmerston next week.And Jim conceded they were outplayed for much of the  minutes by the visitors.However, on a day of shock results that saw Motherwell and Ayr United go down to lower level opposition, Aberdeen held at home by Stenhousemuir and St Mirren having to battle back from two goals down against Alloa to edge through, being in the hat for the fth-round draw was a consolation.It will see Dundee face the Dons or Stenny away –they can come through the second game.“I thought Queen of the South were better than us. We didn’t start the game well,” said Jim.“These cup games are always dficult. Just look at the results around the other clubs and there’s been a few shocks.“I’m just glad that we’re still in the cup and we have another chance to recty that performance. We all know it was short of what we’re looking for.”If he was unhappy with his team’s work, the manager did stress the quality Queens showed did not surprise him.“You’ve got to credit Queen of the South. Give them a bit of credit, they played well.“You know what it’s like when a Championship or lower team comes to a Premiership club. You know they are going to be right up for the game and you know you are going to be in a fight.“They beat Ross County - last week which was a fabulous result against a team who’ve just knocked Motherwell out.”On top of getting another chance, Jim was pleased with the debuts he handed to Dieng, Craig Curran and second-half subs Andy Dales and Andrew Nelson.“The positives for me were the introduction of the newer players who all contributed and there will be better days ahead for us.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c42106f2ca675.54965825-e1547845700567.jpg ","title":"jim mclean saddened by the waygoing of tannadice legends","story":"It’s always sad when a football legend moves on from a club.However, that is the nature of the game, and spaces have to be freed up for new talent brought in or coming through.I can remember a couple of Dundee United-supporting friends being upset when Andy Rolland left the club.They felt, at that time, he could still do a good job for the team.Signed from Cowdenbeath in , Rolland, nicknamed “The Galloping Major”, would stay for  years at Tannadice.United wanted him to stay on but the player had an offer from American club Fort Lauderdale Strikers.Given his tremendous service in playing well over  games for the Terrors, the club immediately granted him a free transfer in September .He said at the time: “This offer has come right out of the blue.“Fort Lauderdale phoned me on Thursday, wanted me to travel on Saturday, and then play my first game for them on Sunday.“But that was too rushed for me.“I expect to go sometime next week.”He continued: “It’s a great offer, and I had to accept.“However, it’s a wrench leaving United after all these years.“Fort Lauderdale have offered me a -month all-year contract, but I’d rather come home when the main season finishes.”Tannadice manager Jim McLean was sorry to see his full-back go.“We will miss him – off the field as well as on it,” he said.“Since I’ve come into Tannadice, we have now lost three great long-serving players – Dennis Gillespie and Doug Smith being the others.“All of them were outstanding club men, and great examples for our young players.”The Dundee United directors also showed their appreciation of his loyalty by making a special payment to him in lieu of a benefit.On ing from America, where he also turned out for Los Angeles Aztecs, Rolland spent two years with Harry Melrose’s Dunfermline, before ending his playing career back at Cowdenbeath.He also managed the Central Park side for a spell."},{"url":null,"title":"no excuses from nathan ralph for dundees poor cup display","story":"If excuses were his thing, full-back Nathan Ralph wouldn’t be short of a few to explain Dundee’s below-par display as they were held at home by second-tier Queen of the South in the Scottish Cup on Saturday.After the three-week winter break, the Dark Blues were not alone in looking rusty as they faced up to the Doonhamers at Dens Park.Elsewhere, as other Premiership outfits got back to competitive action for the first time since the turn of the year, the fourth round saw Motherwell crash out at home to Ross County and Aberdeen held by minnows Stenhousemuir.Dundee were also facing a team that has been in fine form of late and who, in veteran Stephen Dobbie, can boast one of the best strikers in the country, not just the Championship.That they came to Dens and turned in a high level of performance should have come as no surprise.Last, and certainly not least, what turned out to be the first leg of this tricky tie saw Dundee hand debuts to no fewer than four players in the shape of goalkeeper Seny Dieng and attackers Craig Curran, Andy Dales and Andrew Nelson.With so many new faces involved, it was perhaps understandable the home team’s play at times lacked cohesion, though ironically at the weekend it was generally speaking the new players who were the pick of the bunch.That’s all the get-outs listed and Ralph isn’t too interested in any of them. For him, the bottom line is Dundee should have been better than this.“It was very frustrating on Saturday. I think our performance first half, we should be thankful we are still in the cup really,” he said.“It wasn’t good enough. They’ve got the goal to go ahead and then Jesse has done brilliantly just before half-time to get it back and have us level.“It was a good time for us to score and then we did definitely play better in the second half. On the whole, though, it was not good enough.“I suppose it does happen in the cup, we saw that with some of the other results, and the big thing is we are still in there and have a replay where we can make it into the next round.“So we maybe shouldn’t be too hard on ourselves over it but we’re still not happy with the performance.”Like most players after a bad game, now the -year-old just wants to get out on a pitch again and try to put things right.That’s why he breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday when Hearts’ televised clash with Livingston produced a result.Had the Jambos not edged past the Lions, a replay would have been tonight and Dundee’s Premiership visit to Tynecastle would have been postponed.“We have another game right away and that’s good. The one thing we didn’t want was no game this week because Hearts had drawn their cup-tie.“The thing you want to do after the winter break is get back into playing regularly again right away and you don’t want to be missing games because of things like that. You want to get points on the board as soon as possible.”Turning to the subject of the new arrivals, Ralph believes they will signicantly boost the chances of top-flight survival.So far, he’s been impressed by what he’s seen.He added: “I thought the new lads looked sharp and direct. They definitely want to get on the ball, create and make things happen.“I think them coming in this month will be good for the squad and they are going to help us going forward.”"},{"url":null,"title":"readers panel tell us what you think of the tele and you can win 50","story":"The Eveningwants to know what YOU think – and you could even receive a cash reward.Join the Tele’s Reader Panel – a sounding board of trusted readers – to let us know, through short and simple online surveys, what you think of our content.All the answers are vital to us, helping us to provide the kind of paper you want to read.What’s more, for each survey you complete you will be entered into a free monthly prize draw, with three lucky lists each winning £.It really is that simple.Tele editor Dave Lord said he wanted to hear from readers, however they consume the news – be it a copy of the newspaper or online through your mobile or tablet.“This is the perfect opportunity for you, as a reader of the Tele, to tell us what you think and have your say on our future,” he continued.“Please be assured that input from readers is crucial in shaping our content, from news and sport to features.

I’ve enjoyed it, the lads, the training, everything about it has been good,” said the man who is teaming up again with boss Jim McIntyre after their time together at Ross County.“The fitness levels are really good and the lads are at it. You can see they are up for the fight and there is some really good quality here, there’s no doubt about that, so it’s looking promising.”And the Liverpudlian believes three weeks off has given Dundee the chance to recharge their batteries.“I think the break has been a good thing, mentally in particular. I’ve been in this position and sometimes when you are in that rut when you are finding it dficult to pick up points it’s nice to have that break.“Mentally and physically you get away from it and then you come back in like it’s almost a new season, so I think it has been welcome.“And the mood here has been good but I don’t think I’ve been surprised by that because the lads know there is enough here and we are adding a few more bodies, so we know we have what’s needed.“We are up for a fight and you can see that looking round.”Curran believes that willingness, starting with tomorrow’s cup-tie, to do whatever it takes to get wins will be vital in the coming weeks.“There are times when it’s not going to be pretty because of where we’re at. There is going to be that sense of anxiousness going into games but we have that hunger and drive to overcome that.“There might be games that are ugly but these are ones we need to make sure we go on and win.“Whether we scrap it out - or -, we have to win and, once we do, we can then go and play a bit like I know we are capable of.”If, on paper, Dundee have been handed the perfect opportunity to report back with a win by being paired with a side from the second tier, Curran knows they’ll have to perform to make the next round.His time at Tannadice taught him there are decent outfits in that ision and, after facing them twice, he puts Queens in that category.“This is not going to be an easy game, just because they are in the Championship, no one can think that.“They have boys who are good players – Stephen Dobbie is on fire right now with his goals.“So, the mentality is the one thing we have to make sure is right and that’s not something I think we have an issue with. We have to make sure we come out on top, that’s our aim.”Curran also took the opportunity to stress he left United on good terms and thanked Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson for allowing him to move early in the January window.“I had a good relationship with Robbie and I only have good things to say about him.“The style he wanted was to play with one striker and Pavol Safranko has been the best player at United by a margin, I feel.“I understood that and he understood what an opportunity this move was for me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c46e69d052713.02246838.jpg ","title":"tom duthie time has come for dundee united to finally show their true title credentials","story":"From the low of a shock end-of-year defeat at Alloa leading to fears the goal for the rest of the regular season would be to secure a play-off spot, things are suddenly looking up for Dundee United.The arrival in person of new owner Mark Ogren came with a pledge to give manager Robbie Neilson the funds he needs to get promotion.And perhaps, just as importantly, the promise this is a long-term project andit doesn’t happen this term, money will be ploughed in to make sure it does next. It gave everyone with a liking for the Tangerines a lt.So, too, did a dramatic shrinking of the seven-point gap at the top of the Championship courtesy of Neilson’s team taking four points from consecutive home games, while top two Ross County and Ayr United each lost two in a row.That means, for a few hours at least, United can join leaders County on the -point markthey win the second tier’s game of the weekend at Ayr on Friday night.They would, of course, still trail the Staggies, who have a vastly superior goal dference, but just being up there would be another boost.A win would also cancel out the game in hand Ayr hold over United, though they too have a better goal dference. And whatever happens at Somerset Park, Ian McCall’s team will be above themthey beat Inverness next midweek.Perhaps, though, the biggest benefit to United this weekend can be the type of performance that, whatever the points, makes a statement that they’re the ones to beat. That, unfortunately, is something they’ve largely failed to do in three seasons down in the Championship.Past glories, some of them recent, mean United start every campaign as favourites for promotion.And any team walking into Tannadice on a Saturday sees a club geared for football in the Premiership.Too often, however, any edge that’s given United has disappeared because of performances.Even when they’ve lost, in the last two-and-a-half years sides have come out of games against them feeling reputation and expectation have not matched the sum of the parts of the team they’ve faced.Results like two defeats away to Dumbarton the season before last, a - loss at Falkirk last term and two five-goal home losses in this campaign, have led to opposition throughout the ision believing they always have a chance when facing United.In truth, even the draw with Partick Thistle this month and the win over Dunfermline that closed the gap at the top to those three points, were not as convincing as was expected.That’s repeatedly been the case during the two failed attempts to get up. In the big games, too often United have come up short.They did beat Hibs at Tannadice near the end of  but lost heavily to them soon after and quickly dropped off the pace at the top.Andthey won twice at Tannadice against last season’s table toppers St Mirren, the first time came before the Buddies were regarded as their main rivals and the second after Jack Ross’s team were out of sight at the top.This time round, the best so far came up in Dingwall in November when County were beaten -.Without taking anything away from that success, after Paul Watson’s early goal put them ahead, the three points were secured via a gritty rearguard action.Yes, it was the kind of performance that is needed at times in a successful league campaign.So, too, do emphatic victories that tell the rest of the league you are a team to be feared.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"new south ayrshire headteacher bagged","story":"NewsNew South Ayrshire headteacher has bagged dream jobGaenor Hardy,, has assumed control at Heathfield in Ayr, complete with its  pupil roll and  child nursery.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsGaenor Hardy \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new boss of South Ayrshire’s biggest primary school has bagged her “dream job”.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-a-play-a-pie-and-a-pint-15-years-and-500-plays","story":"Chamberlain is auditioning later on, and she has  plays to cast. The first of those, a bite-size version of Liz Lochheadrsquos rambunctious Scots version of Molierersquos comedy, Tartuffe, opens in early February.

As well as it being the initiativersquos fteenth year of operation over thirty seasons, this year will also feature the th play to be produced by A Play, A Pie and A Pint.To celebrate, while the focus of PPP remains on showcasing brand new bite-size dramas, twelve of the forthcoming seasonrsquos productions will form what amounts to a greatest hits set. This shows the range of material which has made its way onto Oran Morrsquos stage in a low-budget, low-risk way light-years away from a prevailing corporate philosophy of big-budget event-based shows.This includes revisiting the debut plays by David Ireland and Denise Mina, as well as favourite shows about comedian Chic Murray, Dusty Springfield and Fe-born darts player, Jocky Wilson. Irelandrsquos play, What The Animals Say, heralded a career which has seen one of his most recent plays, Cyprus Avenue, win numerous awards, while his Traverse Theatre hit, Ulster American, is about to tour to Australia and Ireland. Also revived is Aye, Elvis, Morna Youngrsquos comedy about a female Elvis Presley impersonator.ldquoAfter  years it seems like the right moment to look back, and to celebrate, says Chamberlain.As Fullarton points out, it is also an opportunity to revisit pieces which have all but disappeared from view.ldquoOne of the things about the shows at A Play, A Pie and A Pint is that theyrsquore only on for a week, she says, ldquoso unless the writers and directors can get producers and other theatres interested, they disappear, and there are some cracking plays which deserve the chance of a wider audience, or to be expanded.

Lest there be any accusations of nepotism, the choice of what plays should be seen again was put to a vote involving Oran Mor regulars, with Casablanca coming out on top.Read More: David MacLennan on his lunchtime dreamldquoWersquore being guided quite a lot by the regular PPP audience, says Chamberlain, ldquoand one of the things wersquove tried to do since we started here is to widen the pool of writers involved.

Both come with swathes of experience in theatre and television, with Fullarton combining both in the early s with a TV version of her stage production of Dario Forsquos play, Mistero Buffo, which starred Robbie Coltrane. Chamberlain, meanwhile, co-founded production company The Comedy Unit, responsible for numerous much-loved TV sit-coms.While things have become more streamlined in terms of the day to day running of the company since the early days of PPP, all those involved since have nevertheless retained the sense of low-risk immediacy which MacLennan championed, and despite receiving Creative Scotland funding in a way it might have previously steered clear of, remains a small operation.ldquoOne of the great joys of A Play, A Pie and A Pint for the writers, says Fullarton, ldquois that your play can be on in three months, and it doesnrsquot have to hang around for a year waiting for lots of executive producers to make decisions.

Competition for jobs, and housing was used to fuel the race riot of  and has been repeated throughout the century.\"They add: \"Just as the very same institutions ided the white workers and the black workers in , it allows for the oppressed to be pitched against each other without challenging the engine that drives the oppression.\"Lessons from the Glasgow Race Riots: -Zandra Yeaman and Lou Dear, Coalition for Racial Equality and RightsA hundred years ago today, on the rd January , in the yard of the mercantile marine office in James Watt Street, a race riot erupted in Glasgow. While waiting to be hired, Black and white sailors clashed and a pitched battle broke out. As the Black sailors ran down the Broomielaw, they were pursued by a white mob which swelled to hundreds. Rioters used guns, knives, batons and makesht weapons including stones and bricks picked from the street. Three people were seriously injured during the riot.There will be no events to mark this anniversary. There will be no exhibitions or displays in our museums to commemorate this event. There will be no front page news, nor will schools tell our children about this aspect of our history.The centenary that will be commemorated is the Battle of George Square. The story of the  demonstration organised by the Clyde Workers Committee to support the  hour week movement.The Battle of George Square is inscribed in Glasgowrsquos left wing, trade union history and on display at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. The mythology of the Red Clydeside and its leaders and the mobilisation of ninety thousand workers shows the true nature of Glasgowrsquos radicalism.It shows ordinary Glaswegians fighting the oppression of the establishment fighting for the rights of workers and veterans of the First World War. After all, itrsquos what they fought for.However, perpetuating this narrative without exploring some of the issues that led up to this point leads to a society that does not think critically about Empire a society that fails to acknowledge white privilege and racism.Just eight days before the Battle of George Square, African and Asian workers, also veterans of the First World War and frequently also patriots of the British Empire, were targeted. Until the British Nationality Act of  came into effect, a Black sailor from Sierra Leone was just as British as a white sailor from Glasgow. Everyone was a subject of the British Empire.This was noted in a  letter to the press by the African Races Association of Glasgow:lsquoDid not some of these men fight on the same battlefields with white men to defeat the enemy and make secure the British Empire  Why cant they work now in the same factories with white men  [hellip] Is the treatment meted out to them now compatible with the British teaching of justice and equity, or is it an exhibition of British gratitude rsquoIn her book, Black , Jacqueline Jenkinson points out that the legend of Glasgowrsquos radicalism, whispers of Bolshevism, troops and tanks in George Square, and the brief window of opportunity for revolution on these islands has wilfully obscured the importance of the race riots in this phase of history.More sinister than this is the role that prominent, and memorialised, trade unionists played in inciting the race riots. Emanuel Shinwell Labour Party MP in  for Linlithgow, West Lothian and Willie Gallacherplayed prominent roles in the  hour week strike campaign, which culminated in the Battle for George Square. Jenkinson argues that the race riots and the George square demonstration lsquowere explicitly inter-connectedrsquo.Shinwell and Gallacher, far left, on trial for the Battle of George Square riotShinwell and Gallacher played a part in inciting the race riot by deploying isive arguments about overseas labour as unfair competition for white workers. Indeed, Shinwell addressed a meeting of over  sailors at the mercantile marine yard a few hours before the harbour riot broke out.There was some resistance to this line of mobilisation from within the socialist movement at the time. The Workers Dreadnought published responses to the race riots: lsquoThe fight for work is a product of capitalism: under socialism race rivalry disappears.rsquoBut despite this philosophy some trade unions did not campaign for the rights of all sailors in British ships to be paid the same rate. Instead, they campaigned for a lsquocolour barrsquo to prevent Black sailors being members of the trade union. They also demanded an end to the employment of African and Asian sailors.In , racial hostility continues to be closely tied to employment and continues to be used as a isive tool. Ninety years after Shinwellrsquos speech we had a repeat of the sentiment, lsquoBritish jobs for British workersrsquo, as workers engaged in wildcat strikes in the construction industry.The recent book lsquoNo Problem Here - Understanding Racism in Scotlandrsquo provides the evidence that people from Black minority ethnic backgrounds continue to suffer disadvantage in the labour market in Scotland. Some of this is due to structural racism and some to direct racial discrimination.During the  Glasgow race riot, police removed  Black sailors from their boarding house and into lsquoprotective custodyrsquo. All were subsequently charged with riot and weapons offences. None of the large crowd of white rioters was arrested.Two white sailors were hurt - Duncan Cowan was shot and Thomas Carlin was stabbed. Tom Johnson, a sailor from Sierra Leone was also stabbed. Cowan and Carlin were taken directly to hospital.Johnson, despite his wounds, was taken directly to the magistrates. Mr. Cook, the defence lawyer for the Black sailors in the race riot case, argued that it was lsquopeculiarrsquo that no white person had been arrested for playing a part in the rioting. Cook also exposed the lsquofragility of police evidencersquo during the trial.The case of the race riots in  illustrates race discrimination within the criminal justice system. These injustices are not relegated to this past in modern Scotland, from Simon San to Sheku Bayou, serious on-going questions over the issue of race in Scotlandrsquos criminal justice system should give pause for thought one hundred years after the  race riot.The media in  were concerned about the unlimited pool of Black labour presented by Empire in , they are concerned about immigration. The use of race as a means to scapegoat iniduals caught up in structural economic injustice remains from -. Competition for jobs and housing was used to fuel the race riot of  and has been repeated throughout the century.While the media, political, cultural and education institutions continue to dismiss and ignore these important events in Scotlandrsquos history, racecontinues to be used as a tool to ide our society. Just as our institutions ided the white workers and the Black workers in , silence on racism allows people to be pitched against each other without challenging the engine that drives the oppression."},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-half-of-rail-commuters-struggle-to-pay-full-fare","story":"Passenger anger has soared over recent years as rush hour services rise in cost but fall in quality and reliability.Now a survey has found  per cent of regular travellers say they find it hard to pay peak fares - and  per cent claim they struggle to find seats on trains at the most expensive and busiest times.The poll, of more than  people for CensuswideScotland, also found  per cent of passengers agreed or strongly agreed that peak hours were the worst time to travel.The new research comes after national operator ScotRail suffered a torrid winter spell of cancellations and delays.It also follows a January hike in fares of . per cent on average but . per cent on the anytime full fares and season tickets used by regular commuters working the old standard - day.Fares are rising less quickly than in England - where they remain  per cent higher - but this proved little consolation to commuters.Only one in  Scots travel by train daily but they make up a huge proportion of all journeys and are most likely to pay either full fare or buy season tickets.Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie, of Scottish Labour, said: \"As the poll clearly demonstrates commuters are fed up ndash they donrsquot think they are getting value for money and on current performance they are right.\"Commuters across Scotland have seen their transport fares sky rocket while the quality of their transport service has plummeted.\"In my constituency, the train service has been particularly poor for months, and characterised by delays and cancellations.\"When trains do show up, there are only three carriages instead of six, so commuters are crammed in like sardines on peak hour services.\"Ms Baillie, who is a regular traveller, urged Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to freeze fares and push for better performance.Full fares are applied on the busiest \"peak\" services - in the morning almost everywhere and in the evenings on flagship routes like Glasgow-Edinburgh.They are designed to encourage passengers to travel at less busy times and take the strain off core commuter services.

The  information broadcast by the Brexiters was by no means a one-off occurrence.In  we were told that we were joining a trading group called the EEC and to a greater extent that is exactly what it was. Unfortunately, those in power in the UK whether blue or red did not see Europe as a positive. It became common policy to blame any unpopular action they took on the European Union. In this they were aided and abetted by the red tops and Little Englander press which enthusiastically printed their nonsense and made up their own as well . This swelled the ranks of voters who blindly blamed Europe for any perceived disadvantage they experienced. The logical result of this was the rise of racism and anti-Semitism.Westminster had no interest in working to mould the EU and was seen as a disruptive element standing on the outside throwing insults. The constant bitching about how much our contribution was masked the real net amount which our membership actually cost. The thing Westminster politicians hated was that money paid was ed as grants not to the south-east of England but to rural and regional areas, in which as we all know Westminster has very little interest.The cynical use of misinformation continued through the  Independence referendum and on to the European referendum. It continues today with Theresa May and Liam Fox making absurd statements about the ease of trade deals, nf which obviously Mr Mowbray has also been duped.

As he waited quietly, I could just about discern him counting out the seconds in his head. Without turning round to watch what was going on in these final moments of world-class culinary creation, he simply knew who was doing what and when. Everything came together when it should. The rhythm and harmony of Fairliersquos kitchen ndash the beating heart of Scotlandrsquos only two-Michelin starred restaurant within the Gleneagles Hotel ndash was palpable, and to witness Scotlandrsquos most celebrated chef at the very top of his game was a privilege Irsquoll never forget. I am grateful to him for this and the many subsequent memorable experiences he allowed me to share. Remembering him sitting youthfully cross-legged atop the scrubbed wooden kitchen table of his Glasgow flat, grinning widely with his hair boyishly tousled, for a photographer just after he got his first Michelin star for One Devonshire Gardens in , is particularly poignant.It was Andrewrsquos quiet demeanour and waspish sense of humour that endeared him to so many, not only within the Scottish, UK and international hospitality industries, but also in the fields of art, design and, most recently, horticulture. He was a great collaborator and mentor, and he certainly had a huge personal impact on many journalists, myself included.From my numerous accompanied visits to the Victorian walled kitchen garden in Perthshire he acquired in  after an unsuccessful second course of chemotherapy, it was abundantly clear that he adored it and regarded it as his ldquosalvation, both professional and personal. He loved the quiet energy of the many specimens being cultivated by head gardener Jo Campbell exclusively for his restaurant. ldquoItrsquos so dferent from the crazy energy of the kitchen, he said. ldquoThe garden is a very calming influence and I am sure it has had a beneficial effect. Despite the chemotherapy he never lost his sense of taste and the fresh produce had a galvanising effect on his menus, with dishes headlining the greenery in line with global culinary trends. He loved that diners would travel for miles to sample his take on the fruits of the Scottish terroir, and spent many happy hours with Jo and her team. When I got my allotment last August, I laughed out loud when he cautioned me wryly against letting it take up too much of my time. God knows I know now what he meant.I like to think his humility, which endured even after joining the international culinary elite as one of only a handful of Grands Chefs du Monde, was down to his upbringing in a modest council house in Letham, Perth, and leaving school at  with no qualications. More than once he told me that he felt he was very lucky in le. Marrying his beautul, loving long-term partner Kate White last November was, he told me, the ldquoicing on the cake.At the Michelin Star awards ceremony in London last October, he was using a walking stick with some dficulty but looked deliriously happy as, surrounded by Kate and his closest chef friends, Restaurant Andrew Fairlie retained its second star for the th consecutive year. He had words of encouragement for those Scots restaurant chefs who were left disappointed not to receive a star: ldquoIn the next couple of years Scotland will do really, really well, he said.The last time I saw him was when he invited me to his home just days before the wedding and some weeks after being discharged from the Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow. Struggling under the long-term effects of chemo followed by steroids to help correct his balance, he told me that his brain tumour - first diagnosed in  - had now entered the terminal stage. He wanted the world to know that though he was finally having to give up cooking, the Gleneagles Hotel had assured him that Restaurant Andrew Fairlie would continue with the same long-standing team under head chef Stevie McLaughlin, restaurant manager Dale Dewsbury and business manager Gregor Mathieson ndash whom he had worked with since the early days at One Devonshire Gardens. Over coffee at his home overlooking the Ochils, Andrew confided that hersquod been so worried his staff may be laid off and his restaurant given over to a dferent chef that hersquod had sleepless nights angsting about it. The relief at being immediately assured otherwise was, he said, ldquoa huge weight off my shoulders. Concern for others was an abiding characteristic, and engendered le-long loyalty.For his th birthday hersquod had plans to take his trusted tight-knit team to spend time with head chef Michel Guerard at Les Pres drsquoEugenie, the three-Michelin starred restaurant in south-west France where Andrew had worked at age  as the prize for winning the very first Roux Scholarship in . ldquoThatrsquos where it all began, hersquod said. ldquoReturning will be the final piece of the jigsaw. Though hersquod subsequently had to cancel that long-cherished trip, he bore the disappointment with a philosophical acceptance. ldquoI feel very peaceful, were among his last words to me.I cherish the notebook I used to record my most recent interviews with Andrew. He liked it because of the lobster design on the cover.

Big Garden Birdwatch participants have made a signicant contribution to monitoring garden bird numbers over the past four decades. Those taking part work together as part of a community with thousands of other Big Garden Birdwatchers to help the RSPB’s work to protect birds, other wildle and the places they live.“Reaching  years is a huge achievement and shows just how passionate people across the UK are about their wildle.The survey started as a winter activity for our youth members. It’s now the largest garden wildle survey in the world and appeals to both children and adults because it’s an enjoyable, easy, inclusive activity that anyone can do and a great opportunity to connect with nature.” As well as counting birds, the RSPB is once again asking participants to log some of the other wildle they have seen throughout the year. This year, people are being asked to look out for badger, fox, grey squirrel, red squirrel, muntjac deer, roe deer, frog and toad.To take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch , watch the birds in your garden or local park for one hour at some point over the three days. Only count the birds that land, not those flying over. Note the highest number of each bird species you see at any one time – not the total you see in the hour.For your free th anniversary Big Garden Birdwatch pack, which includes a bird identication chart, plus RSPB shop voucher and advice to help you attract wildle to your garden, text BIRD to  or visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Formartines will be kitted out to showcase Scotland this weekend\"  Visitor Centre to host Haggis HuntviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Out on the ice...The Polar Academys pupils lead the expedition and decide their own route.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

The following autumn links were formed with Moray Firth Radio and a restricted service licence was applied for to enable a temporary broadcast in the area.In October , the first broadcast took place.

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored. Mr Ewing acknowledged the importance of the Orkney beef and lamb brands not just to the islands’ but Scotland’s food and drink sector.

What an extraordinary situation we find ourselves in as we hurtle towards the March  deadline.This week, the Prime Minister put forward her ‘plan B’ after her withdrawal deal was comprehensively rejected last week. You may have noticed that ‘plan B’ looked remarkably similar to ‘plan A’. In fact, it was nearly identical. The only dference was the letter describing it.If the Scottish independence referendum taught us anything, it’s that politicians who fail to produce genuine plan Bs are found out by the public – as Alex Salmond discovered when he failed to outline an alternative to using the British pound in .Theresa May is treating parliament and the public like fools. That’s why she is almost certain – once again – to lose the next vote on her withdrawal deal this coming Tuesday.It’s worth reminding ourselves why there is such opposition to Downing Street’s proposal.First of all, this isn’t even about our future relationship with the EU post-Brexit. This is merely the orce agreement – the terms in which we would leave the EU.It doesn’t cover what happens after we leave and that is why there is a ‘backstop’ to the issues with the border on the island of Ireland. That explains why Number Ten appeared to be floating the dangerous idea of reopening the Good Friday Agreement, before realising that was a complete non-starter. It is an international treaty underpinned by the United Nations and ratied by referenda in the north and south of Ireland.Nobody voted for a Brexit that would see Britain giving away control and leaving people poorer. It means paying a near £ billion orce bill but getting nothing in . It is the worst of all worlds, which is why it has united both Remainers and Leavers in Parliament.: First Minister warns Theresa May must drop hardline Brexit stanceThe Prime Minister has insisted she will continue making tweaks to win over MPs, but the EU has made it clear that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. It is a legal text.That is not the EU being intransigent – the Prime Minister’s red lines make this the only option for the other  member states. To get any movement, she would have to loosen those red lines.Her red lines include leaving the customs union and the single market, ensuring that freedom of movement can end. That’s the freedom of movement which has allowed Brits to travel freely and live and work in European countries, and allowed the British economy to grow by addressing worker shortages in key industries.So we’re in an almighty mess. As things stand, the default scenario the country faces is a ‘no deal’ Brexit. I fear the full impact of this catastrophic option is still misunderstood.It means leaving the EU with no withdrawal agreement in place, falling back on World Trade Organizationtrade rules. That comes with tarfs on imports and quotas, for example cars would be taxed at  per cent every time they crossed the UK-EU border, and dairy products would be hit with a  per cent tarf – hence the stockpiling of key goods. As the EU confirmed only yesterday, it would also mean a hard border with Ireland.: Poll: Two-thirds of Scots believe Brexit makes independence more likelyA ‘no deal’ Brexit would wipe tens of billions of pounds off the UK economy, including around £bn in Scotland, according to the CBI. A hit of that magnitude would have a devastating impact on jobs and living standards, plunging public services into crisis. And who would be the worst affected  The poorest people in society. So that’s why those of us who care about our constituents talk about taking no-deal “off the table”. The fear is that the Prime Minister runs the clock down until March, and we automatically fall off that no-deal clf-edge because time has run out or she bribes MPs to back her botched plan.There are ways to prevent that happening, however.The Article  timetable can be altered – either extended with the agreement of the EU or unilaterally revoked. That has to happen now regardless of the way forward.If the Prime Minister allows us to leave the EU without a deal, her Government will be deliberately choosing to inflict untold damage on its people. That would be unforgiveable.Fortunately, while the Government flounders, many MPs are rising to the occasion. A series of amendments have been submitted, including a Labour frontbench amendment which legislates for the holding of a People’s Vote. Others seek to extend the Article  process.There is, of course, little point in extending Article  in an attempt to tweak the withdrawal agreement, because the negotiations are over.It should, however, be extended so that we can go back to the people of the United Kingdom and offer them a vote to decide our future.I am open-minded about what should appear on the ballot paper, but the most obvious solution is to give voters a choice between the clear measurable propositions of Theresa May’s Brexit deal – which would confirm that the people of the UK still want to leave the EU – and keeping the best deal we already have by remaining a member state of the EU.The Prime Minister claims that a People’s Vote would be damaging to democracy, yet it’s the devastation her deal will inflict on the country that will irreparably damage our democracy – and a ‘no deal’ more so.It’s time to let democracy flourish and put control back in the hands of the British people. Next Tuesday gives parliament an opportunity to do that andthe Labour Party supports a People’s Vote amendment and whips to support it, we can achieve this goal.When that time comes, I know I will put our national interest first and campaign tirelessly for the UK to remain in the EU.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4860730.1548185091!/image/image.jpg","title":"stone circle isn t ancient but it is justified martyn mclaughlin","story":"The stone circle at Holmhead in Aberdeenshire may only date back to the s, but this latest architectural find is still a treasure, writes Martyn McLaughlinThe late Spike Milligan once said that when he died, he hoped to be laid to rest in a washing machine, for no other reason than to confuse the archaeologists of the future.Those who make a living by combing through the detritus of the past in order to better understand who we are and where we come from deserve sympathy. It can be a gruelling, fruitless task, waged in all weathers.But in a conservative discipline where context is everything, it is nice to see archaeologists can also see the funny side of things.The defrocking of the Holmhead stone circle in Aberdeenshire, which until recently was believed to date back to the Bronze Age, shows how those who retrace the journey made by our descendants are prone to the odd misstep.Only last month, Historic Environment Scotland and Aberdeenshire Council declared it to be an authentic prehistoric site. This week, a farmer who once worked the land on which is located disabused them of such notions. The stone circle, he revealed, could be traced only as far back as the era of Britpop and combat trousers.As Neil Ackerman, the local authority’s historic environment records assistant, humbly pointed out on Twitter, the revelation is unlikely to grace his CV in future.“If you are having an awkward day at work, at least you’re not that guy who identied a new prehistoric stone circle to the press that now turns out to be about  years old,” he wrote.It is refreshing to see a professional freely admit to making an error and do so with such good humour. Mr Ackerman has been in his post for less than three years, but his candour means he can look forward to a bright future. As well as providing some levity, the misclassication has helped promote the north east’s established archeological treasures. Who among us would have known of Aberdeenshire’s unique bounty of recumbent stone circles were it not for the imposter in their midst : Ancient stone circle in Aberdeenshire revealed to be modern fakeIn any case, who are we to judge what is real or fake, or to dferentiate those creations that have meaning from the ones that are mere whimsy  For all that technology has aided research into our origins, the stone circles specked across Scotland and further afield remain shrouded in mystery, with the purpose of their creation, the manner of their construction, and the choice of their location as elusive as ever. There are countless competing theories which may offer fragmentary answers, but my favourite proposition is that the people who erected them did so simply to cause a bit of good-natured mischief. If that is the case – and there is no good reason why not – then our Aberdeenshire farmer was keeping this noble tradition alive, albeit inadvertently . Holmhead may be the punchline to a joke that started with Callinish or Stennesh.The search for definitive truths and the contested hypotheses surrounding our stone circles is made to look foolish when you consider the reverence afforded to the pretenders. Take the Druid’s Temple in the Yorkshire village of Ilton, for example. A cluster of stones closely resembling Stonehenge, its eerie formation has given rise to scurrilous tales of satanic worship and archaic rituals.: Fake stone circles ! Who’d be an archaeologist  – leader commentThe reality is that it was built in the early th century at the behest of William Danby, a wealthy landowner who wished to alleviate local unemployment and have a little fun into the bargain. He paid workers a shilling a day to prop up the ft-high stones.Nowadays, a modest annual footfall of tourists give thanks to his eccentric vision, with WRI coach parties happily mingling with new age pagans. Closer to home, there is the wonder that is the Sighthill Megalith, which for years held pride of place at the heart of a once-bustling Glasgow housing scheme. Its stones, quarried in Kilsyth, were lowered into place by a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter as recently as .Just as Thatcherism was about to sink its teeth into Scotland, the circle was created as part of a marvellously Orwellian-sounding initiative known as the Special Temporary Employment Programme. Overseeing the venture was Duncan Lunan, a science fiction author and astronomer. “You would have thought that unless the glaciers came back, nothing could harm it,” he went on to reflect.Sadly, Mr Lunan did not anticipate urban Scotland’s rapacious appetite for regeneration. The stones, a place of worship for druids and respite for Sighthill’s residents, were removed to make way for a quarter-of-a-billion-pound masterplan, but having been championed by the likes of Alasdair Gray, they are due to be installed at a new site later this year. The city would not allow otherwise. Neither of these sites would be accepted as prehistoric marvels, but they are marvels all the same – treasured and respected by the communities around them and the tourists who pass through. That is in large part due to the way they openly invite interpretation and an emotional response. Unlike, say, Piltdown Man, a sophisticated act of fraud which set out to deliberately deceive, they have been carved out of nothing with innocence. They provoke awe, not scepticism.In time, the same will hopefully be said of Aberdeenshire’s latest stone circle. It’s creator clearly had a great love of Scotland’s ancient history, and his painstaking homage deserves to become an attraction in its own right. If you visit in the right state of mind, in search of intrigue and amazement, the chances are you will find it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857392.1547647215!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit nicola sturgeon promises independence timetable in weeks","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said Theresa May is #deluding herself# by trying to persist with her Brexit red lines, and suggested details of the timetable for a second Scottish independence referendum would be revealed within #weeks#.The First Minister was at Westminster to meet with SNP MPs, and said an extension of Article  and a People’s Vote were the only realistic options to break the Brexit deadlock.However, she added: “I’ll say more about the timing of a referendum in the next matter of weeks.“I want to see the UK stay in the EU, I think that would be best for the whole of the UK... even when Scotland is independent, that serves our interests best as well.

That’s the job of the UK government.“What has to be clear is that Nicola Sturgeon would be taking part purely to sell Scotland and nothing more –they’re there at all. The Scottish Tories would be very wary about supporting anything that went beyond that.”The comments come as a spokesman for the First Minister said previous pledges from Downing Street to involve Holyrood in the process have amounted to “warm words and platitudes.” Mrs May’s current “red lines” over a no deal are unlikely to yield progress, he added.Ms Sturgeon’s spokesman said he does not expect anything “hugely signicant” to come out of the meeting today, despite Mrs May promising greater engagement with the devolved administrations in a statement to the Commons yesterday.“We’ve heard that kind of thing in the last number of years – it hasn’t so afar amounted to very much at all,” the spokesman said. “But the First Minister will go along and we’ll see what comes out of that.”The Scottish Government has been frustrated at Mrs May’s approach on the impact of EU departure on Scotland. “We’ve put forward proposals for the past two and a half years which have pretty much been ignored or rebuffed,” the spokesman added.“Every time that there’s an undertaking to involve the devolved administrations and take on board what we say, it’s pretty much warm words and platitudes rather than anything signicant or substantial.

Mr Main said he believed that Mr Macleod may have “fallen overboard while ing to the mooring” and believed there may have been an accident involving a cutout shooting gate that had not been replaced.  - Police failed to report concerns for missing vulnerable man who later diedThe court heard evidence from marine investigation officer Robert Cranston, of the Marine Accident Investigation Branch. He said: “Mr Macleod had not completed the annual self-certication declarations required.” The report into the accident concluded: “The slot-in transom door had not been fitted following shooting and, with no means of fall prevention in use, there was an increased risk of Mr Macleod falling overboard through the shooting gate in the transom, and it is possible that he did so.” Sherf Eilidh MacDonald expressed her condolences to Mr Macleod’s we and sons.

We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative.

But unfortunately it is the residents who are suffering from the impact of all of this.“Depending on the direction of the wind the smell can be so bad it makes me feel nauseous and sometimes you just want to get out of the area to get some fresh air.“You cant hang out clothes, open your windows or sit in your garden. It affects your well-being because you are always thinking how long am I going to have to live with this or will I have to sell-up, leave the home that I have put a lot of effort into and have lived in for many years  The possible health implications are also a major concern.”She continued: “It is not just me there are residents in the area who have farms or homes that have been in their families for generations.“There are other issues as well as the odour and I feel like we are the guinea pigs in all of this.“The company have told us they are working to fix the problem and we are meeting with them again on February .”One man who has lived in the area all his le but does not wish to be named, said he will have to think about movingthe situation does not improve.He stated: “The smell at times is terrible. It is a gassy smell but there is also a rotten smell to it, its hard to explain.“We cant open our windows even during the warm weather. We tried to have them open but I had to get up in the middle of the night to close them the smell was so bad.“Last summer when the weather was good everyone was out enjoying their gardens and having barbecues but we had to either sit in the house or go out to eat somewhere.”He continued: “We were told at the start that we would hear, smell or see nothing but that is not the case. “When the smell gets into the house it takes a long time for it to go. I have even had people saying they can smell it when they are driving along the Craigadoo Road and they ask me how do you stick it .“My we loves to garden but she cant because of the smell. I have lived in the area all my le andthis doesnt improve we will have to consider moving.”TUV MLA, Jim Allister, called on the company to “take urgent action”.Mr Allister led a delegation of residents to a meeting with senior management at the plant on Tuesday, January .He said: For several months these residents have been afflicted with unbearable odours from the plant which processes poultry litter.“When seeking planning permission the plant owners assured everyone they were installing state of the art technology which would ensure no smells. The supposed super efficient technology has failed and now local residents are paying the price.”Mr Allister has vowed towith the residents for a further meeting.He said he would also be pressing the Northern Ireland Environment Agency “to step up its supervision and action”.“The present intolerable position cannot continue,” he concluded.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA, was aware of odour complaints relating to the Anaerobic Digestion facility at Moorfields Road, Tully Quarry.A spokesperson for the Department said: “This facility is regulated by NIEA under a Pollution Prevention and Control Permit and the permit holder is Anaerobic Advantage Ltd.“NIEA agrees that odour management at the facility has not been acceptable and the facility is currently not in compliance with its permit. In response NIEA has been working with the operator in recent months resulting in the operator taking numerous steps attempting to mitigate and resolve the problems. “NIEA staff have visited a number of the residents during this time and we have also worked in close co-operation with the local council Environmental Health officer to obtain information on the odour impact from local residents.“As a result of investigations NIEA issued an Enforcement Notice on  October  requiring the operator to provide detailed proposals to fully resolve the odour problem. The operator has now provided their proposals for additional odour treatment and it is expected this work should be completed by end of January .“NIEA will continue to inspect the site on a regular basis, maintain pressure on the operator to take all necessary actions to minimise odour nuisance and liaise with local residents to keep them updated on progress.”In a statement Stream BioEnergy Ltd said: “We acknowledge and respect the concerns raised and we are continuing to work hard to resolve these as quickly as possible.”  "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8771209.1547630975!/image/image.jpg","title":"coffee morning to raise funds for samaritans","story":"On Saturday January , from am to .pm, a coffee morning will take place in Banbridge#s Old Town Hall, to raise much needed funds for the Samaritans.Ian Burns, one of the organisers of the event, said: “It is very concerning that Northern Ireland has the highest rate ofmale suicides, within the United Kingdom. This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.Vintage car show celebrates th birthdayIN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8779110.1548153767!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Students from local schools were thanked by Action MS recently for their fundriaising efforts over the last year.

P children from Seymour Hill met with Mrs Jess before her birthday and found out more about her le, before sharing the story with the rest of the school.School Principal Mr Stephen Nimmons explained: “During World War Two Mrs Jess worked at a hem stitching factory near Dromore, where she worked on the machines and made fancy patterns around pillow cases and table cloths. “Every day she would have to cycle four miles to work and in the evenings four miles back home – rain, hail or snow. When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers.

The Belfast playwright’s scripts have a reputation for their intense humour, but at the heart of this play are the stark realities of working class le, isolation, and the emotional labour of mothers. The story gives the audience a veritable look into the lives of two overworked and underpaid care workers, Francesand Loretta , who look after the housebound -year-old Davy Magee, whose sole joys in le are horse betting, reading the Daily Mirror, and the music of Frank Sinatra.What turns out to be a catastrophic Monday for the pair begins with a small personal disaster for Loretta her son has forgotten his PE gear – she has to double back home and is late for work. In her absence, Francis has already helped Davy to the bathroom. Loretta arrives at Davy’s bungalow and chats to her friend about their respective family lives – Frances lambasts the education system for failing her entrepreneurial son, who has recently found success selling knock-off DVDs, while Loretta worries about her out-of-work husband and their inability to pay for their daughter’s school trip to Alton Towers. All the while Davy hasn’t emerged from the bathroom.When their charge fails to respond to repeated knocks at the door, Francis and Loretta panic, fearing the worst. As it turns out Davy has, in fact, died. Hilarity ensues as the women come to grips with his death and are presented with a further dilemma whatthey waited a few hours before reporting his demise, allowing them to withdraw his pension from the ATM and collect his winnings from the bookies  It would surely solve their money woes.Fearing the consequences of their petty crime, Frances and Loretta scheme up more and more elaborate ways to cover their tracks. Whatthey were caught  Whatthey were blamed for his death – could they be “up there with Myra Hindley and Fred West ”Theatrical comedy often treads a fine line between being side-splittingly funny and desperately exaggerated, but Fly Me To The Moon undoubtedly falls into the former camp. Despite the unfolding madness and slapstick antics, Tumelty and McGibbon manage to retain a level of realism in their fantastic performances. These two absurd characters could easily be ordinary Belfast women.Jones has written and directed a truly magnicent piece of comedy in Fly Me To The Moon but, crucially, the humour is punctuated, at critical moments, by important social commentary. Like many pensioners, the lonely Mr Magee, whose phonebook only contains the number of his bookie, lived a le in isolation – “a le of misery” as Frances says.

That’s all we asked and that’s what got.“Peter Healy, Kristian Healy, Odhran Eastwood, boys like that, James McAuley, Joe Maskey – calm heads. Eoin Nagle was fantastic up front.“It’s going to take a good team to beat us.

An Spidéal’s discipline undermined any slim hopes they had of getting back in the contest, with Eoin Ó Droigheáin and Conal Ó Caoimh picking up black cards either side of Ó Lao’s dismissal as Naomh Éanna held their nerve to claim a seven-point victory.

He said the US ignored Moscow’s offer to inspect the missile made during talks in Geneva earlier this month – a refusal he alleged reflected the lack of US interest in meaningful negotiations.Mr Ryabkov said the US has made it clear during diplomatic contacts that President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the pact is final and not subject to talks.US undersecretary of state Andrea Thompson, who led the American side in the talks, has said Moscow’s offer is inadequate.“To see the missile does not confirm the distance that missile can travel, and at the end of the day that’s the violation of the treaty,” she told reporters last week."},{"url":null,"title":"powys paddles up for open newtown riverside plans","story":"Canoe Access points at Newtown will be discussed by planners\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"POWYS: Paddles up for Open Newtown riverside plansGoing Green For A Living Plans for open spaces in Newtown\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"welsh government launch this is not love this is control campaign","story":"Library image depicting domestic violence\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"New campaign launched in Wales to help people in controlling relationshipsJane Hutt\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"cylch meithrin llanfair caereinion rated good by estyn inspectors","story":"Llanfair Caereinion Nursery Cylch Meithrin has had a lsquoGoodrsquo Estyn reltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtport.

First class facilities are nothing without first class staff and at the Downe we are very lucky to have both, she said.Mrs Hanlon remarked: ldquoHospital staff are clearly eager to embrace the challenge of expanding services and I have no doubt that in the years to come the Downersquos reputation as a first class facility with passionate, professional staff will see services grow and develop further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Head blasts at ‘disparity’ over student allocations  ","story":"A GRAMMAR school principal has hit out at education chiefs for not equally planning for an expected increase for post-primary students.Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, says that the Department of Educationhas addressed the need for additional students in Belfast, Bangor and Londonderry by awarding some schools additional places, but has failed to address the local need for  .He has accused DENI of treating some areas in Northern Ireland dferently to others and has urged the Department to address the local problem sooner rather than later.ldquoWe know that this is a major issue waiting to happen, said Mr Dobbin.ldquoStatistics clearly show that there is a signicant number of extra girls to be accommodated across our vast catchment area and I will be left with very angry parents and pupils who are extremely unhappy with not being allocated Assumption Grammar as their preferred choice.ldquoThis would be understandableall schools in all areas were being treated the same, but this is not the case.ldquoHow can some areas be addressed proactively and then other areas neglected  This disparity and the disrespect towards the parents and children in our local area, compared to other areas, is appalling.Statistics from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency show that an increase of an average of  children in this age group in the Down district annually over the next ten years.However, last night a DENI spokesperson said that it had reviewed the anticipated shortfall and that no additional places for next year were needed in Ballynahinch.ldquoAt the end of the admissions procedure in ,  places remained available in Ballynahinch,  of which were in the denominational sector.

He is very focused on where he comes from. He’s very keen to do the right thing in helping to build positive relations through sport. He doesn’t seek any kudos for it.”He added: “After the formalities of the presentations Jacob is probably spending another hour with the kids, signing autographs and taking selfies.“I don’t consider myself old but I’m more than twice Jacob’s age. When you are in your late forties speaking to an assembly of school kids they look at you thinking you’re old. “Jacob is . They’re looking at him thinking he’s not much older than us. He speaks the same language as them, they can relate to him.“It’s nice to have an accessible sporting star.”Although Jacob was born in Newtownstewart, he moved to Lurgan as a schoolboy, going to school at Wallace HS in Lisburn. Up until very recently he lived with his mother and father in Lurgan, but has now moved to Belfast.Gavin said: “Lurgan is a very polarised town. The overriding aim of the project is to reach the hand across the community. Although Lurgan is the lead club we’re engaging with local Gaelic clubs – Eire Og and St Peter’s.“We have a sport like rugby which is played on an All Ireland basis and we have an inidual who could make it into a world XV team on our doorstep and who is willing to turn up at school events.

Both men are aged in their s.It is the first time two artists have collaborated on one of the city council’s official mayoral portraits.The painting, which also depicts Councillor McAllister’s son Finn, was officially unveiled at a reception at Belfast City Hall on Tuesday evening.Speaking at the event, Councillor McAllister said: “The idea for a collaboration was sparked during a visit to the University of Ulster’s Art School when I saw a lot of the wonderful work undertaken there and was later introduced to the artists, Jamie Baird and Daniel Nelis.“All of us were excited by the challenge we were undertaking and it was the thrill of trying something dferent that would capture the challenges and opportunities the Lord Mayor’s role represents.“It involved a lot of discussion between all three of us but I am delighted at the result and hope that both artists enjoyed the process as much as I did. The portrait perfectly reflects a memorable year in my le, and the pride I took in serving Belfast as first citizen.“My son Finn has been included because he was a very important part of that year and accompanied me to a number of engagements, especially those reflecting the emphasis on supporting families and opening City Hall to people of all ages.”The artists said the collaboration was something they hadn’t done or even thought about before, and involved a lot of discussion as to how they could incorporate their dferent styles and vision before the portrait got underway.Jamie explained: “Although collaboration is intrinsic to much of my work as an illustrator and graphic designer, collaboration in the capacity of teaming up with another artist, and bringing together dferent distinct styles and approaches to create something new, was essentially uncharted territory for me prior to my involvement in this project“The entire creative process took the best part of a year, and involved a lot of back and forth between Daniel, Nuala and myself. Daniel and I really wanted to do justice to Nuala in reflecting the core aspects of her identity and values, both as a person and as a Lord Mayor.“I think all in all as a team we have achieved this, creating something pretty unique in the process.”Almost , homes in Craigavon without power Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Daniel said that after initial reservations on working on something that would stand outside what he had done as artist in his own right, “it was a rewarding and enjoyable experience which I would do again  per cent.”He added: “PreviouslyI had been asked to do a collaborative piece I would have said no, because the nature of my work is more solitary and contemplative but the more Jamie and I discussed how it could be done the more rewarding the experience was.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council revealed that the total cost of the portrait was £, – a sum that will be split between the two artists.“It is one cost for the portrait and the cost is split between the two artists,” she said.The council spokesperson said the choice of artist is “at the former Lord Mayor’s discretion, and Councillor McAllister’s preference was to have both artists work on her portrait.”Councillor McAllister’s portrait cost less than the £, spent on the painting of her predecessor, DUP alderman Brian Kingston, but more than that of  Sinn Fein mayor Arder Carson, whose portrait cost £,.Both artists have agreed a statement which will sit alongside Councillor McAllister’s portrait and set its themes in context.The statement says: “Through the material selection, the painting aims to remain respectful of the tradition of the mayoral portraits, while at the same time acting as a representation of the progressive and youthful energy brought during Councillor McAllister’s term, the first young mother to be sworn in as Lord Mayor of Belfast.“Respectively, the use of colour, the presence of the Cavehill native ash leaf and bluebell, and most signicantly the presence of Councillor McAllister’s son, Finn, all strive to stand as an embodiment of Nuala McAllister as a public representative, as an inidual, and as a mother.”try catch  TrendingSnow brings N.I. to standstill - traffic chaos as Belfast International Airport shuts runwayN.I. man dies after he is electrocuted while fitting new lightN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursIN PHOTOS:  pictures of the heavy snowfall in Northern IrelandN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degC          ..

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before her move to London she had worked for Paul Rankin at Roscoff’s.Mary-Anne said she had always intended to come home from London and her original intention was to open a café deli. She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc.

It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn a year","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer an annual £bn drop in output in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/darren_1.jpg","title":"ones to watch darren nugent","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew What does your company do and what role do you play Our company is Ion Distillery and I am one of two co-founders along with Peter McBride from McBride Retail Group. My main responsibility is as head distiller, and I am responsible for producing our range of small batch craft spirits at our distillery in Co Tyrone.How did the business start and how has it grown We have just launched our range of three products into the market but we have been working behind the scenes on Ion for the past two years. We have already negotiated listings with a supermarket chain and distribution with a English-based drinks distributor.What is your background My background is in marketing and PR having worked for organisations such Liverpool Football Club, Pilkington Glass, Kingspan, Kawneer Architectural Systems and Wickes. After ing home to Northern Ireland I founded Pokertree Brewing Company in .What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths The main dference is our production methodology. Ion is irish for the word ‘pure’, so our ethos is to strip everything back to produce products in as pure a way as possible in keeping with how they were originally manufactured. Rather than having one jack-of-all trade still, all our equipment has been custom built by hand and was specic for the products we intended to produce – so we have a dedicated still for each. Our rum, for example is made in the only Caribbean-style doubler still in the UK or Ireland. This lends a real authenticity to the product.Who are your main customers As a new brand we are only beginning the process of rolling out our products across Northern Ireland, but already have shelf presence with many quality independent retailers as well as presence in SuperValu and Centra stores across Northern Ireland. We have also negotiated a distribution partnership with Berkshire-based BWH Drinks to service the London market.Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow There has been exponential growth internationally within the craft spirit sector, and at Ion we have ambitions to follow other successful local brands in showcasing the very high standard of drinks produce coming out of Northern Ireland. Over the next few years we aim to increase production, expand our portfolio and develop a presence in several export markets.What challenges have you faced Any small business starting out faces the same challenges – access to finance and a need for support and guidance as the business finds its feet. That is why I am very fortunate to have a partner in this venture of the calibre of Peter McBride – founder of McBride Retail Group. Investing financially in the business, but almost more importantly, using his extensive business acumen to help steer Ion in the right direction.Who most inspires you I have huge respect for James Watt and Martin Dickie – co-founders of the Aberdeen-based craft beer ‘empire’ Brewdog. Divisive in terms of past guerrilla-marketing tactics – it is undeniable that the pair have used their savvy and understanding of their market and social media to grow BrewDog into one of the world’s largest craft drinks businesses.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I see myself as continuing on the journey of building Ion into a national and then international Irish spirits brand – becoming synonymous with quality in the process.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
