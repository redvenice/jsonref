But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Carnival Cruise Line: A history of flooding and other disastersRoyal Wedding weather: Will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s big day be a washout?Met Gala 2018: Date, theme, hosts and moreMarvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

Regardless, USGS scientists expect fissures to keep spewing.The lava could eventually be channeled to one powerful vent while others go dormant, as has happened in some previous Hawaii eruptions, Stovall said.Kilauea, one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983.The USGS\u0027s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a notice in mid-April that there were signs of pressure building in underground magma, and a new vent could form on the cone or along what\u0027s known as the East Rift Zone.

Until Sunday when, for the first time in more than a decade, they met.She said the now 17-year-old young woman was shaking like a leaf. They spent the afternoon together, and Jane told me: \u0027Just seeing her sitting on my sofa – actually sitting there – was unbelievable, magic.\u0027 Then her granddaughter gave her that message of love.Unemployment could be set to fall to levels not seen since...Baroness Joan Bakewell claims the NHS is discriminating...Share this articleListening to the quiet joy in Jane\u0027s voice as she described her magical afternoon, I found tears filling my own eyes.As with many grandparents, the cause of the family split was a orce. Her son and his wife had broken up, and she\u0027d lost contact with her granddaughter.They were forbidden from meeting, writing or speaking to each other, and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.She\u0027d tried hard to stay calm, neutral, not to interfere and bide her time, but years of silence and stalemate were hard to endure.For years Jane has kept one memory alive in her heart, of her granddaughter, aged seven, sitting in the back of her car: \u0027I could see her, her blue eyes shining, a smile as broad as the Earth, as she waved goodbye.\u0027This enforced separation is a source of heartbreak for so many grandparents, and grandchildren, and something I have campaigned against for many years.At the last count, in 2016, around 2,000 grandparents went to court to try to fight for the right to see their grandchildren – an expensive, frustrating and harrowing act borne of desperation. And without the rights of grandparents enshrined in law, often ultimately futile. And these were the lucky ones, who could afford to hire professional help.That is why I was overjoyed this week to hear that these voices are finally being listened to.          Jane Jackson hasn\u0027t seen her granddaughter since she was seven. Pictured, Jane with her granddaughter in 2007Parliament is to look at a change to the Children Act 1989, which could establish a \u0027presumption\u0027 that grandparents (and uncles and aunts) have a right to see their grandchildren, nieces and nephews, after the children\u0027s parents break up.Jane, 66, and her husband Marc founded the Bristol Grandparents Support Group – of which I am patron – offering support to others in the same, sad situation. \u0027I preach to the others that they should never give up hope. But the truth is I gave up hope years ago,\u0027 she admits. \u0027So if it can happen for us, it can happen for anyone.\u0027I am yet to hear Jane\u0027s full story, of how she finally broke through to her granddaughter, but having spent a glorious Bank Holiday weekend with two of my grandsons, I know how precious this contact is. If anyone told me I could never see my grandchildren again, I would feel as if my heart had been plucked out of my chest. We have such fun together. I may be far too lenient, I may spoil them terribly, but that\u0027s my role as a grandparent.I remember the same warm, easy love from my own grandmother. When as a teenager I ran away from home after a stupid row with my mother, I rang Granny and told her I was going to spend the night with her.She made a slap-up tea for me and sent me home the next morning. Years later, when she needed eye surgery, I stayed with her to put the drops into her eyes. I treasure the little crystal bow brooch she left me in her will. I named my oldest daughter, Emily, after her. Her love of children inspired me – I still remember how they clustered around her. And what angers and distresses me is the knowledge that thousands of today\u0027s children have been cut off from what should be the heart and soul of a family: the grandparents. That is why I see this proposed change in the law as not so much a victory for grandparents, but for grandchildren.Of course, circumstances do exist where it is in the child\u0027s best interests not to be in contact with a grandparent, but to deny them this precious relationship needlessly feels pointlessly cruel and almost sadistic.Both grandparents and grandchildren have written to me in their hundreds. They\u0027ve tearfully told me of Christmas cards and birthday presents returned, of grandparents being warned by the police that they were \u0027stalking\u0027 by trying to send letters and gifts. One grandmother said: \u0027The police arrived, read the riot act to me and left me sobbing behind a closed door.\u0027Jane knows of several grandparents who actually took their own lives. Many grandparents have described their loss as \u0027a living bereavement\u0027, knowing that their grandchildren are alive but prevented from even sending them a simple loving message.Why does this terrible split in a family happen? Often, but not always, it\u0027s due to a bitter orce or separation. Sometimes it even happens when one partner dies, a time when the whole family needs to comfort and support each other. And yet a grandmother told me that when her daughter died of breast cancer, \u0027as soon as she passed away her husband pushed us out of the children\u0027s lives. When my daughter died it was a double loss – you have the loss of your daughter to deal with and the loss of no contact with your grandchildren. We have no rights. No power. No voice.\u0027This proposed change in the law could see an end to that. Jane, who for many years worked as a teaching assistant for children with special needs, says there is still a long way to go.She told me: \u0027Meeting my granddaughter is not the end of the story, it\u0027s just the beginning. We must keep up the pressure on MPs to change the law.\u0027 Recently I was able to introduce Jane to Nigel Huddleston MP, who held a debate last Wednesday, and MPs from every party joined the cause. Now Lucy Frazer, a minister in the Justice Department, has promised to look at this very simple change to the Children Act.          Dame Esther Rantzen is pictured with her grandchildren Alexander, two, and Benji, fiveThis is not a law to take sides in a orce, or weaponise warring parents. This is a change in the law designed to protect and support children who need and long for that precious inter- generational relationship.For some, alas, it is too late. Michael, aged 29, bitterly regrets the loss of his grandparents. He wrote to me: \u0027My grandmother died when I was 12. We were not allowed to go to her funeral. My grandfather tried the legal route, and found he had no rights whatsoever.\u0027My grandfather died when I was 16. Again we were not allowed to attend the funeral. I remember asking my mum if I could see him before he died. I was not allowed. I feel a sense of deep loss, guilt and regret. As a child you are powerless to insist that you see your grandparents, however much you may want to.\u0027French law gives children that power. But when British grandparents as a last resort do go to the courts to ask for access, all too often it costs thousands of pounds to no avail.The simple addition to the Children Act which is proposed would not only change attitudes in our courts, but perhaps also in parents. No matter how bitter a separation is, surely the children should be given as much security as possible, and the continuity of a grandparent\u0027s love can be healing when a child is in real pain.As one grandson wrote to me: \u0027The summers that I shared with my grandparents are the most memorable in my life. However, things changed when I was nine or ten. That\u0027s when my parents\u0027 relationship became a bit rocky. My grandmother still sends letters and occasionally we speak on the phone… I do miss them very much, and hope that some day I will be able to visit them again.\u0027So I do hope Miss Frazer recognizes this is not about grandparents\u0027 rights, it is to protect and support grandchildren. Thousands who are suffering a \u0027living bereavement\u0027 need the support of the law.And one day many others, like Jane Jackson, will be able to rejoice in that simple message that means so much: \u0027Grandma, grandpa, I love you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/00/4BF30BDF00000578-5701579-image-a-7_1525736175306.jpg","title":"Gleaming grey wants Black Beauty","story":"    With his dazzling coat, Woody looks like the whitest grey horse in the world, particularly after a grooming session at his stables           As these pictures show, the 20-year-old hunter is not keen on keeping his pristine appearanceMiss Billington told the Daily Mail that getting Woody\u0027s coat in order and looking spotless often takes her hours at a time.But the 34-year-old joked: \u0027Sometimes I don\u0027t know why I bother.It\u0027s Panda-monium!

She has two grandchildren. Sally smiles as she reads back her childhood dreams of a world where 2,000 people live on the moon, ‘England is like Switzerland with no fighting’, ‘the Russians no longer invade other countries’ and ‘the whole world is running out of food’.‘It is just so me socially, politically and ecologically aware — a lot of what I’m passionate about now, but I had no idea I had that sort of understanding or thoughts when I was 11,’ she says.But as eloquent as her essay is, Sally’s recollections of that time are tinged with sadness.Not long after she’d written her essay, Sally’s mother committed suicide. She had discovered that her husband was having an affair with one of her friends. Sally and her three younger brothers were almost immediately uprooted and taken to Cumbria by their father, who never discussed their mother’s death.It was only later that they began to piece together what had happened in their parents’ lives. ‘I was probably well into my mid-20s before I could really talk about it,’ says Sally, who has been married to her second husband Nigel, an electronics engineer, for nearly 20 years.    I still regret money woes killed off my ideal career Jackie Adkins laughs as she re-reads the three paragraphs that constituted her idea of an ‘essay’.‘I work in a hair dressers and looking for a shop (sic) when I have saved up some money I will buy one,’ she wrote. Cinema trips with friends and buying clothes on a Saturday — those were Jackie’s dreams.  Cinema trips with friends and buying clothes on a Saturday — those were Jackie Adkins\u0027 dreams. Today, she has been married to Paul, 63, for 35 years and has three children and one grandsonToday, she has been married to Paul, 63, for 35 years and has three children and one grandson. She wonders whether she wrote so little because she was so certain where she would be at 25.‘I was always going to be a hairdresser,’ says Jackie. ‘I used to cut my own hair and my mum’s and I used to carry my hairdressing scissors in my school bag and at lunchtime the girls would say “can you do my fringe for me?” or “can you put layers in my hair?”’Jackie loved her secondary school in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, one of the brand-new comprehensives, and was among the first year to start when it opened in 1969.She had a place to study at hairdressing college when, aged 16, her parents moved to Sussex, and her dreams were shelved. She found herself working in a bank because her parents could not afford to support her through college.Her father had a heart attack and died when Jackie was just 19, so her income was even more essential and thoughts of going to hairdressing college faded.She remains wistful about the career that might have been — she still cuts her grown-up children’s hair and one of her daughters is a hairdresser — but Jackie says: ‘Once I got into the cycle of earning money, it was so hard to break away from that.’Jackie left banking after the birth of her second child and since then has done everything from selling candles to catering for parties and working for a mining recruitment company.But today, after surgery for a benign tumour in her stomach, Jackie is ‘enjoying taking life a little slower’, while helping her builder husband with his books from their home in Lancing, West Sussex.‘It’s time to do the things we couldn’t do when the kids were younger,’ she says. ‘I’m off to Amsterdam soon, going to do a Scandinavian boat tour in the summer and next year we are hoping to go to Cuba.’  All I knew was that I didn\u0027t want to be like my father Looking back, Steve Christmas is all too aware of the poignancy of his essay.Writing about his grown-up life, he predicted he would be a ‘sargant’ (sic) in the police with a wife named Jane, a new surname (Stephensone), a house in Wales and four children.The new surname and life in Wales were, he suspects, because he wanted to get as far away as possible from Harwich, Essex, where his parents ran a café and sweet shop.  Steve Christmas\u0027 father was an alcoholic who could put away a bottle of whisky a day and was verbally abusive to his wife and two sons. He promised himself he wouldn\u0027t ever be like himSteve’s father was an alcoholic who could put away a bottle of whisky a day and was verbally abusive to his wife and two sons.‘I didn’t want to be me,’ says Steve, who now lives in Eastbourne with wife Sue, 57, a PA for the NHS, whom he met on holiday aged 21. ‘I wanted to be this other person.’School was also miserable for Steve. ‘I wasn’t very clever,’ he says. ‘There was too much else going on in my life. I think today someone would have noticed.’He left school with no qualifications aged 15, and moved with his family to Rye, East Sussex, where he worked as a farm labourer, until his father went bankrupt and uprooted them all again to nearby Hastings. ‘I remember making a conscious decision that I wasn’t going to be like my father,’ he says.Steve didn’t become a policeman — he realised before leaving school that at 5ft 9in he wasn’t tall enough and that he would struggle to pass the exams he needed.Instead, several years later, he started working for an insurance company, and studied at night to pass his vocational exams, discovering he was actually quite bright after all.Fatherhood came late for Steve. After leaving home at 31 to marry Sue, they eventually had daughter Emma, now 23, through IVF, thanks to Professor Robert Winston. ‘All I wanted when I was 11 was structure, to be happy, have children and for them to be happy, and that’s what has happened,’ smiles Steve, who took early retirement before setting up his own business writing wills.As for his father, he died in 2003, a year after Steve’s mother.‘That last year I learned a lot about him,’ says Steve. ‘I stopped him drinking so much, stopped him smoking. Before he died he gave me a big cuddle, which he had never done, he apologised and said: “I’m really sorry for what I’ve done.” \u0027Life’s too short to stay bitter. What happens in your childhood doesn’t have to hold you back.’  My dream was dashed but I still feel like that little boyNigel Wakeford was a clever child who passed his 11-plus and became the first boy in his family to go to grammar school.His was a happy childhood with his three siblings and parents. ‘My dad married at 18 and was working class. He did lots of different things, and ended up doing admin for a bus company,’ recalls Nigel.   Nigel Wakeford was a clever child who passed his 11-plus and became the first boy in his family to go to grammar school. He dreamed of being a soldier but failed the medical because he had a lazy eye‘But if he had ten bob in his pocket he’d take us out on the weekend.’ There were sailing trips, horseriding and countryside jaunts.Aged 11, Nigel dreamed of being a soldier. Visualising life at 25 he wrote: ‘I do not spend much time at home because I travel a lot abroad. At the moment I have a job as corpral (sic) in the army. \u0027There is a lot of drill and hard work in it but we do have some pleasure time we go to the pictures and have dances.’Sadly, Nigel’s dreams of joining the Armed Forces were not to be.Leaving school at 16, he did attempt to join the RAF. ‘I went to the recruitment office in Brighton and did all the exams. \u0027I was told I had one of the best English comprehension test papers they’d ever had, but then I went for the medical and failed because I had a minor eye defect, a “lazy” eye.’Naturally optimistic, he is not regretful but feels he missed out on a ‘career’. While clever enough to get his English and Maths O-levels a year early, he spent much of his working life in different jobs, before becoming a carpenter.Now semi-retired, but looking for a part-time job, he is mortgage free and enjoying life near Lewes, East Sussex, with his wife Caroline, a civil servant.His hobby is classic cars — and he’s been an MG Owners Club member for 35 years.‘I’d be a rich man if it wasn’t for cars and bikes,’ he jokes. ‘I still feel much younger than I am, I’ve never lost that. Mentally I’m still 12.’  I was bored with the workday grind even then! Aged 11, Paul Hoggins imagined life as a lawyer who has already fallen out of love with his job.He wrote: ‘The alarm clock goes for the start of another day. Another day of work at the office. How boring all I do is sit reading books . . . Why couldn’t I be a miner instead of a lawjer (sic) (who doesn’t do a thing).’In the event, he became a journalist, and while he doesn’t remember his childhood ambitions, he recognises his love of language and sardonic outlook in the essay.  Aged 11, Paul Hoggins imagined life as a lawyer who has already fallen out of love with his job. But he went on to become a journalist and remembers his love of language as a child‘My wife saw it and laughed and said that explains a lot,’ says Paul, a father-of-three who has four grandchildren. ‘For an 11-year-old there’s quite a dose of cynicism in there. And I always enjoyed creative writing and English.’Paul grew up on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, living with his four siblings, his mum’s younger half brother and his parents — eight of them squeezed into a three-bedroom council house while his dad worked for Pilkington, the glass manufacturer.‘I think I got my dad’s graft and my mum’s brightness. In a different time she would have gone to university, but she was a full-time mum until we all got older,’ says Paul. He took a degree in business studies but, as soon as he finished, he followed his older brother to work on a local newspaper.‘Before my degree, I never had it in my head that I would become a reporter,’ he says. ‘But when a junior reporter’s job came up on the local paper, I never looked back.’Paul, who confesses he has had a rewarding working life, still lives on Sheppey, with fitness instructor wife Amanda and works part-time at the Daily Mail. One son has followed in his father’s footsteps, one is a carpenter and the third has learning difficulties and lives in a nearby care home."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/23/4BF3F34300000578-0-image-a-9_1525731672349.jpg","title":"RICHARD LITTLEJOHN time Nonce Finder General dock","story":"    When he\u0027s not trying to shackle our free Press, or cosying up to the odious Max Mosley — from whom he has accepted £540,000 in donations — Tom Watson can be found pursuing a deranged vendetta against senior Tories he accuses of sex crimes. In a harrowing interview in Saturday\u0027s Mail, Sue Reid spoke to a young couple caught up in the madness who were threatened with the prospect of their baby daughter being taken away from them.Their only \u0027crime\u0027 was to live in a two-bedroom flat in the same building as ex-Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who was wrongly accused of three counts of murder, child sex abuse and male rape.In February 2015, police and social services turned up at the property, on the Duke of Rutland\u0027s estate in Leicestershire, and ordered Adam and Charlotte Coxon to move out immediately.MasterChef contestant Aldo Ortado is revealed as a...Madonna, Cindy Crawford and Katharine McPhee get ready for...DJ Simon Mayo who earns £400,000 a year believes BBC...Met Gala 2018: Heavenly bodies!

And that is exactly what it is doing.’          The official figures are a vindication of the policy introduced by Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretaryAt least 180,000 households have had their benefits capped since the policy was introduced. Of these, 48,000 no longer have their payments restricted under the cap because they have begun claiming working tax credit, which means someone in the home has taken a job.The official figures are a vindication of the policy introduced by Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, when Miss McVey was a junior minister in the department. He brought the cap into force to make sure that households receiving benefits were not paid more than workers bringing home a modest wage.More than 50 families were earning the equivalent of an almost £70,000 salary in benefits before the cap was introduced.The cap currently limits the amount in state benefits one household can claim in a year to £20,000 outside London and £23,000 within the capital.It applies to the combined income families receive from benefits including jobseeker’s allowance, housing benefit, and child benefit."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/08/4BF761FB00000578-0-image-m-24_1525763754232.jpg","title":"Blundering town halls blamed nine ten delayed roadworks","story":"    Drivers across England and Wales endure the equivalent of 128 years – or 47,000 days – of over-running roadworks a monthBut despite a government crackdown on utility companies to ensure they complete roadworks on schedule, councils are responsible for the vast majority of hold-ups.Last night AA president Edmund King accused councils of ‘taking their eye of the ball’.Road repairs carried out by local highway authorities – and the contractors they are employ – are three times more likely to over-run than those done by energy, water and telecoms providers. Often this is because workmen fail to resurface the road to the required specifications.The delays are particularly irritating for motorists who notice little improvement in their crumbling local roads, which are often riddled with potholes.Mother of murdered 17-year-old scrubs his blood off the...Family of taxi driving grandfather, 57, who had \u0027a heart...Share this articleRoadworks carried out by councils between April and July last year lasted for 4.2 million days, or 68 per cent of the total. But they were responsible for 132,000 ‘over-run days’ – 94 per cent of the total.Utility firms carried out 1,965,000 days of roadworks – or 32 per cent of the total. But they were responsible for just 9,000 over-run days.Councils typically carry out roadworks to resurface roads, fill in potholes, add ‘traffic-calming’ measures such as speed bumps, or to change the road layout. Some of these projects can be longer and more prone to delays. Utility firms dig up the roads to carry out repairs to infrastructure such as gas pipes and water mains, or to lay new pipes and broadband cable.          Roadworks carried out by councils between April and July last year lasted for 4.2 million days, or 68 per cent of the totalThe damning figures are contained in the latest ‘England and Wales performance scorecard’ report published by the Highways Authorities and Utilities Committee. The organisation collects data from highway authorities run by town halls, as well utility firms and the Government. It was set up to ensure roadworks are carried out safely and to help minimise the impact on the public.Mr King said: ‘While roadworks are essential, delayed roadworks are the bane of drivers’ lives – they waste their time, money and test their patience. While gas, water and cable companies are often blamed, it appears from these figures that the performance of local highway authorities is far worse and that they have taken their eye off the ball. They need to get their house in order.’A spokesman for the Local Government Association said councils tended to do longer-term roadworks which can more easily over-run, adding: ‘It can be misleading to compare data across councils and private companies.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/17/4BF1A7DF00000578-5698687-image-a-11_1525711045045.jpg","title":"Britain basks glorious sunshine temperatures hotter HAWAII","story":"    Crowds enjoy the sunshine on the hottest May Bank Holiday on record on the beach at Bournemouth  Friends enjoy each others company as they sunbathe near Hampstead Heath Mixed Bathing Pond in north LondonForecasters expect temperatures to plummet by more than 10C by next weekend – back to the average of around 16C (61F) for the time of year.

In 2015 his Speaker salary went up by 0.62 per cent, while in 2016 and last year it rose 0.42 per cent.That meant his overall package hit £152,896 in 2017-18 - compared to £151,451 for the PM.Boris Johnson warns Trump there is no \u0027Plan B\u0027 to sticking...EU\u0027s hard line on Brexit \u0027is driven by fear of a Corbyn...Share this articleThe increase for this year is not thought to have been calculated yet, and will be backdated to April.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has asked parliament\u0027s standards watchdog to examine the claims about the Speaker - which he insists are untrue. Tory MP Paul Scully said the \u0027inconsistency\u0027 of Mr Bercow\u0027s moods frustrated MPs.He told the BBC\u0027s Westminster Hour: \u0027There are some days he could probably do with taking the medicament he prescribes backbenchers every other Prime Minister\u0027s Questions himself.

Until Sunday when, for the first time in more than a decade, they met.She said the now 17-year-old young woman was shaking like a leaf. They spent the afternoon together, and Jane told me: \u0027Just seeing her sitting on my sofa – actually sitting there – was unbelievable, magic.\u0027 Then her granddaughter gave her that message of love.Unemployment could be set to fall to levels not seen since...Baroness Joan Bakewell claims the NHS is discriminating...Share this articleListening to the quiet joy in Jane\u0027s voice as she described her magical afternoon, I found tears filling my own eyes.As with many grandparents, the cause of the family split was a orce. Her son and his wife had broken up, and she\u0027d lost contact with her granddaughter.They were forbidden from meeting, writing or speaking to each other, and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.She\u0027d tried hard to stay calm, neutral, not to interfere and bide her time, but years of silence and stalemate were hard to endure.For years Jane has kept one memory alive in her heart, of her granddaughter, aged seven, sitting in the back of her car: \u0027I could see her, her blue eyes shining, a smile as broad as the Earth, as she waved goodbye.\u0027This enforced separation is a source of heartbreak for so many grandparents, and grandchildren, and something I have campaigned against for many years.At the last count, in 2016, around 2,000 grandparents went to court to try to fight for the right to see their grandchildren – an expensive, frustrating and harrowing act borne of desperation. And without the rights of grandparents enshrined in law, often ultimately futile. And these were the lucky ones, who could afford to hire professional help.That is why I was overjoyed this week to hear that these voices are finally being listened to.          Jane Jackson hasn\u0027t seen her granddaughter since she was seven. Pictured, Jane with her granddaughter in 2007Parliament is to look at a change to the Children Act 1989, which could establish a \u0027presumption\u0027 that grandparents (and uncles and aunts) have a right to see their grandchildren, nieces and nephews, after the children\u0027s parents break up.Jane, 66, and her husband Marc founded the Bristol Grandparents Support Group – of which I am patron – offering support to others in the same, sad situation. \u0027I preach to the others that they should never give up hope. But the truth is I gave up hope years ago,\u0027 she admits. \u0027So if it can happen for us, it can happen for anyone.\u0027I am yet to hear Jane\u0027s full story, of how she finally broke through to her granddaughter, but having spent a glorious Bank Holiday weekend with two of my grandsons, I know how precious this contact is. If anyone told me I could never see my grandchildren again, I would feel as if my heart had been plucked out of my chest. We have such fun together. I may be far too lenient, I may spoil them terribly, but that\u0027s my role as a grandparent.I remember the same warm, easy love from my own grandmother. When as a teenager I ran away from home after a stupid row with my mother, I rang Granny and told her I was going to spend the night with her.She made a slap-up tea for me and sent me home the next morning. Years later, when she needed eye surgery, I stayed with her to put the drops into her eyes. I treasure the little crystal bow brooch she left me in her will. I named my oldest daughter, Emily, after her. Her love of children inspired me – I still remember how they clustered around her. And what angers and distresses me is the knowledge that thousands of today\u0027s children have been cut off from what should be the heart and soul of a family: the grandparents. That is why I see this proposed change in the law as not so much a victory for grandparents, but for grandchildren.Of course, circumstances do exist where it is in the child\u0027s best interests not to be in contact with a grandparent, but to deny them this precious relationship needlessly feels pointlessly cruel and almost sadistic.Both grandparents and grandchildren have written to me in their hundreds. They\u0027ve tearfully told me of Christmas cards and birthday presents returned, of grandparents being warned by the police that they were \u0027stalking\u0027 by trying to send letters and gifts. One grandmother said: \u0027The police arrived, read the riot act to me and left me sobbing behind a closed door.\u0027Jane knows of several grandparents who actually took their own lives. Many grandparents have described their loss as \u0027a living bereavement\u0027, knowing that their grandchildren are alive but prevented from even sending them a simple loving message.Why does this terrible split in a family happen? Often, but not always, it\u0027s due to a bitter orce or separation. Sometimes it even happens when one partner dies, a time when the whole family needs to comfort and support each other. And yet a grandmother told me that when her daughter died of breast cancer, \u0027as soon as she passed away her husband pushed us out of the children\u0027s lives. When my daughter died it was a double loss – you have the loss of your daughter to deal with and the loss of no contact with your grandchildren. We have no rights. No power. No voice.\u0027This proposed change in the law could see an end to that. Jane, who for many years worked as a teaching assistant for children with special needs, says there is still a long way to go.She told me: \u0027Meeting my granddaughter is not the end of the story, it\u0027s just the beginning. We must keep up the pressure on MPs to change the law.\u0027 Recently I was able to introduce Jane to Nigel Huddleston MP, who held a debate last Wednesday, and MPs from every party joined the cause. Now Lucy Frazer, a minister in the Justice Department, has promised to look at this very simple change to the Children Act.          Dame Esther Rantzen is pictured with her grandchildren Alexander, two, and Benji, fiveThis is not a law to take sides in a orce, or weaponise warring parents. This is a change in the law designed to protect and support children who need and long for that precious inter- generational relationship.For some, alas, it is too late. Michael, aged 29, bitterly regrets the loss of his grandparents. He wrote to me: \u0027My grandmother died when I was 12. We were not allowed to go to her funeral. My grandfather tried the legal route, and found he had no rights whatsoever.\u0027My grandfather died when I was 16. Again we were not allowed to attend the funeral. I remember asking my mum if I could see him before he died. I was not allowed. I feel a sense of deep loss, guilt and regret. As a child you are powerless to insist that you see your grandparents, however much you may want to.\u0027French law gives children that power. But when British grandparents as a last resort do go to the courts to ask for access, all too often it costs thousands of pounds to no avail.The simple addition to the Children Act which is proposed would not only change attitudes in our courts, but perhaps also in parents. No matter how bitter a separation is, surely the children should be given as much security as possible, and the continuity of a grandparent\u0027s love can be healing when a child is in real pain.As one grandson wrote to me: \u0027The summers that I shared with my grandparents are the most memorable in my life. However, things changed when I was nine or ten. That\u0027s when my parents\u0027 relationship became a bit rocky. My grandmother still sends letters and occasionally we speak on the phone… I do miss them very much, and hope that some day I will be able to visit them again.\u0027So I do hope Miss Frazer recognizes this is not about grandparents\u0027 rights, it is to protect and support grandchildren. Thousands who are suffering a \u0027living bereavement\u0027 need the support of the law.And one day many others, like Jane Jackson, will be able to rejoice in that simple message that means so much: \u0027Grandma, grandpa, I love you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/23/4BF3F34300000578-0-image-a-9_1525731672349.jpg","title":"RICHARD LITTLEJOHN time Nonce Finder General dock","story":"    When he\u0027s not trying to shackle our free Press, or cosying up to the odious Max Mosley — from whom he has accepted £540,000 in donations — Tom Watson can be found pursuing a deranged vendetta against senior Tories he accuses of sex crimes. In a harrowing interview in Saturday\u0027s Mail, Sue Reid spoke to a young couple caught up in the madness who were threatened with the prospect of their baby daughter being taken away from them.Their only \u0027crime\u0027 was to live in a two-bedroom flat in the same building as ex-Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who was wrongly accused of three counts of murder, child sex abuse and male rape.In February 2015, police and social services turned up at the property, on the Duke of Rutland\u0027s estate in Leicestershire, and ordered Adam and Charlotte Coxon to move out immediately.MasterChef contestant Aldo Ortado is revealed as a...Madonna, Cindy Crawford and Katharine McPhee get ready for...DJ Simon Mayo who earns £400,000 a year believes BBC...Met Gala 2018: Heavenly bodies!

But they were responsible for just 9,000 over-run days.Councils typically carry out roadworks to resurface roads, fill in potholes, add ‘traffic-calming’ measures such as speed bumps, or to change the road layout. Some of these projects can be longer and more prone to delays. Utility firms dig up the roads to carry out repairs to infrastructure such as gas pipes and water mains, or to lay new pipes and broadband cable.

The organisation collects data from highway authorities run by town halls, as well utility firms and the Government. It was set up to ensure roadworks are carried out safely and to help minimise the impact on the public.Mr King said: ‘While roadworks are essential, delayed roadworks are the bane of drivers’ lives – they waste their time, money and test their patience.

He had chosen the role because he felt he was becoming a “Bond slave” and the film was about as far away as possible from the cartoon smoothness of 007. Cannes wasn’t much interested in that distinction, however. Goldfinger had come out the previous year Thunderball was on its way. When Connery cruised the Croisette in an open-topped sports car it was Bond, “Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” as the New York Times called him, the crowds wanted to see.Connery, for all his reluctance to identify with his character, clearly didn’t disappoint.

Although Degas portrayed her in a relatively conventional pose, her most famous trick – repeated when she and her troupe visited London – came when a bronze cannon was lifted into the air suspended from a strap held in her teeth while she hung from the trapeze.“When I told her about Miss LaLa, Blaze said: ‘But I thought I was the only one,’” said Prof Vanessa Toulmin, the joint curator of the Circus! exhibition and founder of the National Fairground and Circus Archive at Sheffield University. “The history of black performers is there but it’s not always obvious. You have to look for it.”Toulmin pointed out that Degas had been interested in the athletic human body almost as an architectural element silhouetted against the roof of the circus, and that it was not clear in the painting that Miss La La was black – though that is obvious from some 19th-century circus posters and in the only photograph Toulmin has been able to find of the performer. Degas, who produced several paintings and drawings of Miss La La, referred to her in letters as “my beautiful negress”.Her real name was Olga Brown and she is said to have been born in Prussia – present-day Poland – in 1858 and placed with a circus by her mother at the age of nine. She performed a flying trapeze and a human cannon ball act with the Kaira Troupe, at the Cirque Fernando and in circuses and music halls across Europe, including appearances at the Folies Bergère in Paris, Royal Aquarium in London in 1879 and the Gaiety theatre in Manchester. She moved to the US where Toulmin – who believes Brown may well have changed her name once or several times again – loses track of her.The exhibition opens in Sheffield and versions of it will be seen later in Great Yarmouth and Newcastle. It is part of the Circus 250 festival, celebrating the anniversary of a British art form that went on to conquer the world of entertainment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e76b45c600d319267ebc317841a540ecb177c2/0_220_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7a6875a93bd369192a781c23fb8fc0a","title":"japan takeda takeover shire cybg virgin money business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, including the latest on two takeover dealsCity analyst Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets has also spotted the gap between Shire’s share price and the Takeda offer...That takes them to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.However, shares are only trading around £40.50, while Takeda’s offer values Shire at a juicier £49 each.That suggests the City isn’t convinced that this deal will actually get the green light from shareholders.

But will anyone else move in?Billboards promising another way of life have long clustered alongside the clogged highways of central Cairo. Advertisements for gated housing developments called “Regent’s Park”, “Beta Greens” or “Uptown” promise “360-degree greenery” and open spaces. One, on a busy and polluted central road, invites onlookers to “just breathe”.The promise of escape from the congestion of central Cairo to a new life 40km away on the city’s outskirts is fetishised for those able to afford it. Nowhere is this more clear than on the billboards advertising real estate in “Entrada”, a housing and commercial property development in Egypt’s new administrative capital, which is currently without a name. “Welcome to a supreme community,” proclaims one. The development is touted by its creators as “the entrance to a new city, a new lifestyle, a new community and a new worldwide centre of attraction”.The alternative capital will  700 sq km, making it almost as large as Singapore, and is intended to house a total of five million people. The plan shows an expanse of high-rises and residential buildings as well as a “government district” all stationed around a central “green river”, a combination of open water and planted greenery twice the size of New York’s Central Park.The project is designed to wipe clean the problems of Cairo, and build a glistening new future. Most government buildings, as well as those occupied by the Egyptian president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, are scheduled to move there in June 2019. Foreign embassies are also encouraged to relocate, and businesses will be lured to a central business district of 20 Chinese-built skyscrapers. But what will happen to the old city once the new capital takes root?If the government’s plans are successful, the move will leave behind a network of empty buildings, all owned by the same umbrella company as the new capital, and for which there is currently no plan. For the government, the new administrative capital represents a fresh start – but one that will draw wealth from the existing capital.During a visit to the site last October, journalists were invited to view the construction of Egypt’s largest church, a new cabinet building, and stood looking at a stagnant future ornamental pool as a pair of fighter jets conducted a ceremonial flyover. Pictures of Entrada show spacious villas next to snaking pools of water and advertise their proximity to the development’s 4km of theme parks and so-called natural terrain. A two-bedroom apartment – with “a view of water”, private gardens and a maids’ room – is listed for around £45,000. The spokesman for the project, Khaled El-Husseiny, resisted questions about the quantity of affordable housing available in the new capital and the average price of real estate. “Forget the numbers, they’re not important and not fixed,” he said, frustrated. “We have a dream, and we’re building our dreams now.”“For example, the ministry of housing owns a building or many buildings in downtown Cairo,” he says. “I will give a new ministry building here, a smart and connected one, air-conditioned and up to date, and we at ACUD will take the old one. We are establishing a new company just to control all the buildings that we will receive from all the ministries.” The future of the many buildings that make up Egypt’s sprawling state infrastructure, mostly situated on prime real estate in central Cairo, remains uncertain. “We have no plan as to how to invest in these buildings, but we will fix it and figure it out,” says El-Husseiny. “Maybe we can make them into hotels.” Profits from these vacated buildings will then feed back into the ACUD. But it is also unclear just how much money is being sunk into the new administrative capital. It was given an initial estimated cost of £30bn in 2015.“There is no total budget,” says El-Husseiny. “It’s a big one, a great one, but we must also calculate the cost of building infrastructure.” He adds that the ACUD was founded with a cash injection of 204bn EGP (£8.5bn) from the ministry of defence and the ministry of housing, but emphasises that the project will continue without further government assistance.There are two kinds of budget, he says: “The budget according to the documents and the actual budget they have to pay.” He says the ACUD has already repaid 20bn EGP to the banks, although the source of these funds is unclear, as is who will ultimately pay for the rest of the sparkling buildings shown in the plans.El-Husseiny stresses the budget for the new capital will be settled on a “case by case basis” as each part is constructed. The governmental district, for example, will cost 40bn EGP. – By way of comparison, Egypt accepted a $12bn (£8.8bn) emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund in 2016.The new capital will also draw on Cairo’s much-needed resources. Two water stations will pump an estimated 200,000 cubic metres of water per day, siphoning water from nearby satellite cities. Once the project is completed it will use an estimated 1.5m cubic metres of water per day. “In Brazil it was Rio and it became Brasília – we need this. It costs billions, we know, but we need it,” says El-Husseiny, referencing Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa’s landmark project to build a new capital in Brazil, now regarded as a symbol of the failure of urban planning and inequality. It is hoped Egypt’s new capital will house almost twice the population of Brasília, while paradoxically appealing to incomers as a way to escape Cairo’s crowded street life. There is no doubt that Cairo’s rapidly expanding population desperately needs housing. The number of inhabitants grew by half a million in 2017, making it the world’s fastest-growing city. Greater Cairo, now a megalopolis, housed 22.9 million people as of mid-2016 and is projected to contain 40 million by 2050. But the city is already ringed by a large collection of half-empty planned towns, each a failed monument to their developers’ inability to draw the bulk of the population away from downtown Cairo. Workers unable to afford to move to the new capital may be able to use the proposed electric train and monorail to get to work, but there are no guarantees that these will be competitively priced either. “In order for the new capital to succeed, if the goal is to reduce congestion, it doesn’t come simply by moving a few thousand employees,” says Elshahed. “Most government employees don’t own private cars, so it’s not like it’s them congesting downtown Cairo.”El-Husseiny, however, is determined that his vision alone will entice enough new residents, including foreign embassies and those working there. “We will give them benefits not available in the old Cairo, wide streets and a smart city,” he says, going on to outline something quite dystopian: “A smart city means a safe city, with cameras and sensors everywhere. There will be a command centre to control the entire city.” A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Cairo says that while the Egyptian government has located space for embassies, they are currently “assessing the move”. Other embassies contacted by  Cities were hesitant, but unwilling to discuss this publicly. “Cairo isn’t suitable for the Egyptian people,” says El-Husseiny. “There are traffic jams on every street, the infrastructure can’t support the population, and it’s very crowded. Without any specific masterplan, it has started to become ugly … there’s no humanity.”There is no doubt that Cairo’s congestion makes residents fantasise about escape, although wide streets, double-glazed windows, open water and pruned topiary seem more like the dreams of suburban London or Chicago than ideas well-adapted to the desert plain. But El-Husseiny is adamant. “We need a landmark, a new capital. We have the right to have a dream and this is our dream.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0408986f616a570ee18fdc54f5e8e21916a29b9e/0_183_2299_1379/master/2299.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f949e47f00fa1ce7541d981e22298e34","title":"eu core values viktor orban hungary fidesz party expel parliament grouping","story":"Boris Johnson should change his name and move to Hungary. “My policy on cake,” Johnson famously says, “is pro having it and pro eating it.” With this approach to Brexit, the British government will end up neither having its cake nor eating it. Viktor Orbán’s nationalist populist Hungarian\u0026nbspgovernment, by contrast, is triumphantly practising the\u0026nbspJohnson doctrine. It receives more European Union cake per capita than any other member state while mustering nationalist support by biting the Brussels hand that feeds\u0026nbspit. Boris Johnzsönhelyi would be a\u0026nbsphappy\u0026nbsptrooper on the Danube.Poland is also having its cake and eating it. According\u0026nbspto European commission figures, more than half of all public investment in Hungary and Poland in 2015-17 was funded by the EU. I recently visited one of Poland’s poorest regions wherever I went there was a road, a bridge, a marketplace or a train connection being modernised with EU funds. Yet the country’s de facto leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, has eviscerated the independence of the courts, turned public service radio and television into propaganda organs for his Law and Justice party, and continues to pursue Orbánisation à la polonaise. He hasn’t got as far as Orbán, but the consequences of east-central Europe’s largest country sliding into Hungarian-style soft authoritarianism would be larger for the whole EU.Here is a fundamental challenge to anyone who thinks the EU should stand for values of liberal democracy, pluralism, the rule of law and free speech. If it doesn’t defend these values at home, it cannot be credible advocating them abroad.Reflecting on the Orbánisation of Hungary, the political scientist Jan-Werner Müller asks: “Can a dictatorship be a member of the EU?” Of course, Hungary is not yet a dictatorship, but the EU has completely failed to draw a red line and say “thus far and no further”. I am confident Britain will remain a liberal democracy even if it leaves the EU Hungary and Poland, by contrast, will remain members of the EU but are ceasing to be liberal democracies. In the very countries where, three decades ago, the causes of freedom and Europe advanced so magnificently arm in arm, these causes are now being prised apart by skilful, anti-liberal populists exploiting a longstanding disconnect between the Europe of values and the Europe of money.This problem runs through the history of European integration, with the values being defended by the Council of Europe, its European court of human rights in Strasbourg, and to some extent the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) – whose election monitors criticised Hungary’s running of its recent election. The EU started life as an economic community. For decades now, attempts have been made to reverse-engineer the values back into the economic community. This has worked well in influencing the behaviour of countries aspiring to EU membership, but once a country like Hungary is inside the union, it rapidly finds it can get away with almost anything.What can the EU do? It has applied to Poland an elaborate procedure for addressing “systemic” threats to the rule of law, including proceedings for infringement of the treaties. This has been important symbolically, but largely ineffective. Poland’s own ombudsman, Adam Bodnar, finds that the rule of law has already been seriously undermined, and the constitutional court emasculated. Brussels has been playing chess against a kickboxer. The kickboxer wins.For the first time ever, the EU has activated article 7 of its basic treaty, identifying a serious and persistent breach of fundamental EU values in Poland. Article 7 envisages sanctions, up to and including suspension of voting rights in the union’s internal decision-making, so long as all other member states agree. But they won’t, because Hungary will have Poland’s back and Poland Hungary’s.Increasingly, attention has turned to linking the\u0026nbspmoney countries get from Brussels to respect for the rule of law. In last week’s proposal for the EU’s 2021-27 budget, the European commission has elaborated a remarkable procedure: if there are “generalised deficiencies” in a member state’s legal system, the EU can cut the flow of funds. Since such an action only requires a majority in the European council, Poland and Hungary couldn’t veto it.In addition, the European anti-fraud office and the European public prosecutor are to crack down on corruption in the distribution of EU funds. This matters because a crucial part of east-central European Johnsonism is using EU funds for political patronage, rewarding supportive media owners and other cronies, as well as more straightforward pocket-lining. The outsize, brand new football stadium and barely used single-gauge railway near Orbán’s childhood village of Felscút has become a global symbol of this.The European commission proposals are welcome, but will not begin to bite for several years. We need something with more immediate impact. That something is the expulsion of Orbán’s Fidesz party from the European People’s Party (EPP) before next year’s European elections. The EPP is the EU’s main grouping of centre-right parties. Leading figures from its member parties include German chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, and European council president Donald Tusk. It emphatically holds high the values of liberal pluralist democracy.What is more, party groupings such as this, with their spitzenkandidaten in European elections, are supposed to be at the heart of the EU’s internal democratisation. Yet it keeps in its ranks a party that is not only dismantling liberal, pluralist democracy at home, but fought its last election on an anti-Brussels, xenophobic platform, including dog-whistle antisemitism in posters plastered across the country targeting George Soros and a fictional “Soros plan” for flooding Hungary with Muslim migrants. The EPP does not merely tolerate Fidesz it actively supports it. As the Fidesz MEP József Szájer noted in an appreciative email to fellow MEPs (leaked to Politico), EPP parliamentary leader Manfred Weber “came … to Budapest to support our campaign, to stand firm beside us”, and party president Joseph Daul “considerably helped us to score this success”.When I make this argument to friends in these centre-right parties, they say:\u0026nbsp“Oh, but it’s still better to have Orbán inside because we can influence him there.” And so they go on\u0026nbspnursing the classic illusions of appeasement, playing\u0026nbspchess against a kickboxer.We don’t have time for this any more. The matter\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspurgent. If Poland follows the Hungarian path,\u0026nbspmuch of\u0026nbspeast-central Europe will have succumbed\u0026nbspto creeping \u0026nbspauthoritarianism – and all of\u0026nbspthis will have happened inside the European Union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8188d2b44d0acafb099026da183ac730f53a88c9/0_317_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e186b545ca118da6c935ec859d63b9","title":"brexit deal mess leavers cheerleaders abandon","story":"At some point, we will need new words for “remainers” and “leavers”. They are legacy terms from a one-off campaign that will, on Brexit day, become obsolete. Does remain then become rejoin? Will leavers turn into stay-outers? Or perhaps the labels will outlive their original function. It happens. People who describe politics in terms of “left” and “right” aren’t talking about seating arrangements in the French national assembly at the end of the 18th century, although that is where the categories were born. I doubt that the Brexit brands will be so durable, or mutate so far, but they have come a long way already.Remainer is the more elastic of the two. It applies to full-throttle revanchists who campaign to dispose of Brexit altogether. But it is also used for soft-leavers in the cabinet who have signed up to Theresa May’s negotiating agenda, and that doesn’t involve much remaining at all.Beyond Westminster, there is a tenuous link between domestic Brexit tribes and the institutions commonly (and inaccurately) called “Brussels”. Some ideological Eurosceptics read the treaties before denouncing them, but they are a minority of leave voters. Most wanted rid of the European Union for less precise reasons.Remainers and leavers accuse each other of exaggerated passion – naively romantic or aggressively paranoid – for concepts that are only tangentially connected to the actual EU. Both are right. Britain’s membership of the club has become a proxy for culture wars fought on multiple fronts: immigration, globalisation, environmentalism, even penal policy. Attitudes to capital punishment and multiculturalism were a better predictor of people’s attitudes towards the EU in 2016 than whether they voted Labour or Tory in previous elections.A misalignment of party allegiance and territorial strongholds in the Brexit culture war is wreaking havoc\u0026nbspwith conventional political models. That, in part, was the story of last week’s local elections. It doesn’t matter to leave voters in, say, Amber Valley, that Jeremy Corbyn endorses the referendum outcome. His party hums with the socially liberal, metropolitan cultural vibrations of Brexit-bashing London. So Labour did fine in the capital and other big cities, but struggled to\u0026nbspcapture more provincial targets.Many of the Tory high priests of Brexit style themselves as liberals. Boris Johnson is much more relaxed about immigration than May. Michael\u0026nbspGove is waging a millennial-friendly war on discarded plastic. But a Govian eco-Brexit doesn’t impress remain voters in Richmond upon Thames, who see it as a green patina only recently formed on the roof of a church whose patron saint is Nigel Farage and whose guiding creeds are social conservatism and reactionary nostalgia.Many Tory leavers resent that characterisation. But if they didn’t want their image contaminated by bitter intolerance, they should have been more careful about the company they kept in the referendum campaign, and the racially tinted messages they borrowed. Besides, backbench Eurosceptic hardliners keep the flame of nationalist grievance roaring because it burns bridges to Europe so much more efficiently than their own rarefied arguments about regulatory ergence.Jacob Rees-Mogg would not have as much purchase on the current debate over customs regimes, for example, if it were framed as the quest for a technical solution to a problem raised by May’s commitment to a very hard version of Brexit (which it is). His voice is amplified by culture warrior megaphones, rallying leave partisans to defend the one true Brexit against treasonous counterfeits.That dynamic is hardwired into the whole project. There is a mismatch between leave culture, which thrives on heroic simplifications, and leaving in practice, which is a labyrinth of unheroic complications. The deeper into the maze May plunges, the harder it gets for those who campaigned with promises of a swift and easy escape to express sincere satisfaction with the final product. Many Tories will decide that any Brexit is better than none. They will murmur their assent to May’s deal and, once Britain has been bundled out of the EU, agitate for new leadership. They will not reject May’s Brexit, but nor will they rush to own it.That is because none of the advertised benefits of leaving the EU will materialise. Leavers will experience total victory in the political battle over EU membership, but without equivalent advances in the culture war. May’s deal will not accelerate reconciliation between a younger, liberal generation that feels its future has just been vandalised by its angry elders. And, over time, the brutal logic of human mortality favours the junior cohort. I don’t like the ugly, ghoulish habit that some remainers have of mapping a route to pro-European majorities through the graveyards of ageing leavers. Still, the underlying demographic observation is not entirely false.A less macabre observation in the same vein is that the historical trend is for British provinces to look and behave more like the big cities, not the reverse. In\u0026nbspterms\u0026nbspof social attitudes, where London goes, Nuneaton follows. And when politics is consumed by culture wars, that is bad news for the Tories, even if Brexit passes without economic calamity.The remainer tribe isn’t going to renounce its metropolitan mores just because the cause of remaining in the EU is lost. And the leaver tribe, upon leaving, will cling to grievances that were channelled against Brussels but not caused there. Neither side will cherish May’s messy deal and, because it will be unloved in the country, few MPs will have much incentive to defend it.There may be no shortage of will to deliver Britain out of the EU now, but in time there will be a great washing of hands and collective denial of responsibility for the deed. Brexit is the adopted child of a whole generation of politicians. It will be an orphan one day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2745ca69927c45c23416eb161370b00e469eaa6b/0_170_5104_3063/master/5104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=352481d677916f6f6e04b680370195ce","title":"the guardian view on generational inequality its time for a new deal","story":"Housing and health are at the centre of a much-needed holistic approach to a fresh trade-off between young, middle-aged and older BritonsIt will soon be a year since Theresa May’s mid-election U-turn in 2017 on her party manifesto social care proposals. That volte-face changed the outcome of the general election and reshaped British politics. Opponents were able to damn the proposal as a “dementia tax” and to force Mrs May to scuttle the idea, even while she continued to protest, absurdly, that nothing had changed. Mrs May has never quite recovered – and nor has the debate about long-term care. Twelve months on, her humiliation still casts a shadow over the politics of social policy.It must be hoped that today’s final report of the intergenerational commission set up by the Resolution Foundation thinktank is not destroyed on the launch pad in the same way. There are good reasons to think that it won’t be: this is not an election campaign and it is not being put forward by the government. In fact, this report is potentially far more significant than last year’s botch. It is vital that British politics at the highest levels in all parties begins to address the issues and the proposals put forward by David Willetts and his well qualified and politically balanced commission – his team included the heads of both the TUC and the CBI. For unless the intergenerational contract, between the old, those in working families and the young, is convincingly reset in the 21st-century terms that the commission proposes, the tensions between the successful and the struggling in society will widen and the credibility of consensual democratic politics will suffer another destructive jolt.Unlike Mrs May a year ago, Lord Willetts and his colleagues have put forward an interlocking and holistic set of proposals. They have spent two years looking at health and social care, the housing market, the pension system and the decline in real wages, especially among the young. Their proposals are not in separate silos. The whole thing is predicated on the mutual dependence of the generations – rather than on their rivalry in the contest for resources. An intergenerational pact underlies and defines the possibilities of the welfare state, as it does for many families. At the moment, however, the pact is frayed and the outcomes are unfair. That must change.The commission’s recipes range from the cradle to the grave and from the mainstream policy idea to the novel. All 25-year-olds would receive a £10,000 “citizen’s inheritance” payment for restricted housing or business use, financed out of a new lifetime receipts tax to replace inheritance duties. Older people would benefit from a £2bn boost to social care, paid for out of higher property taxes. The health service would get an extra £2.3bn levy as a result of new national insurance rules on the earnings of those\u0026nbspabove pension age. Reforms to housing are central to the approach and are aimed at young people and those with young families. Health, social care and pensions would meanwhile be strengthened for older\u0026nbsppeople.The commission is coy about providing a comprehensive costing of all its proposals, though inidual plans are mostly linked to a wide variety of tax changes. But there is no shirking the centrality of the state in engineering the restoration of social interdependence through a new social deal. That new deal would reshape the burden of taxation in favour of the young and at the expense of many of the old. Much of this is a very direct challenge to recent political orthodoxy, because older voters – more pro-leave and pro-Conservative – would be expected to do more than at present to finance the life chances of young ones – more pro-remain and pro-Labour.Resources are unfairly distributed, but they are not infinite. Not all injustices can be solved by higher health spending or by higher taxation confined to the very rich, although some of them can. The commission is right that public sentiment remains wholeheartedly in favour of intergenerational fairness, but it is also right that society has changed, particularly as a result of ageing. Reforms and trade-offs are inescapable. A year ago, Mrs May’s attempt to confront the electorate with one of the hard policy dilemmas in this field was a disaster.

On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

There were no league tables, no Ofsted, no academies or free schools. Parent choice and competition had barely registered on the national consciousness.All that changed 30 years ago this summer with the introduction of the 1988 Education Reform Act, a huge piece of legislation that introduced the national curriculum and the idea of ersity and a “schools market” in which parents would vote with their feet, in theory encouraging the best schools to expand and the worst to improve or close.Three decades later, the tools of that market – performance measures and inspection reports – are a fact of life. “Go compare”-style websites ranking local schools are taken for granted. New education providers, in the form of academy trusts, are a reality in most communities.And Phillips’s school, Lilian Baylis Technology School, in Lambeth, south London, would appear to exemplify the benefits of this approach to public services.Situated in one of the most deprived parts of the country, it was propelled into the national headlines when the former cabinet minister and local parent Oliver Letwin proclaimed at a Tory party conference fringe meeting that he would rather beg on the streets than send his children to the school closest to where he lived.Today it is outstanding on every count, oversubscribed and achieving impressive results with a erse intake. The 1988 reforms played an unambiguous role in that improvement, says Phillips: “They shone a spotlight on schools failing young people like this one.”He is more guarded about the overall success of the market experiment: “I would give it six out of 10. More accountability provided a great opportunity for my generation of school leaders to prove ourselves and the national curriculum was right because it reduced inequality, even if it has been undermined by academy freedoms.“But performance measures (such as the new Progress 8) have now become impenetrable to most parents so may not even be helpful for exercising choice.“The school you go to still depends on where you live – we see parents swapping council houses to come here. Intake and its social class still influences how some parents make their choices and these subtle forces influence selection.”In the past six months I have been researching a new book, The Best For My Child. Did the schools market deliver?, which looks back at the 30 years since the passage of the 1988 act. The unease Phillips voices about the market reforms came through interviews with many of the key players in recent education reform.The English schools hierarchy is as powerful as ever, with some choices only available to a select group of parents who can afford hefty fees, move to the catchment of a successful school, or pay for costly private tuition to pass high-stakes entrance exams. Popular schools haven’t expanded to accommodate all comers, as pure market advocates predicted, and failing schools have proved hard to close down.The complex interaction between choice, admissions practices, house price and performance measures has led to segregation typified by schools with radically different profiles from their local communities.Some parts of the country, recently categorised in 12 new government-designated “opportunity areas”, appear stubbornly resistant to every policy initiative of the past 30 years.“The idea of applying the market to something that isn’t a market has bedevilled this policy from the start,” says Phillips. “A market is always going to have winners and losers. You can’t close down failing schools until they have completely collapsed their roll. What the sociologists call the ‘parentocracy’ doesn’t really exist in places where there are two rather than 20 local schools.”Meanwhile, there is growing concern about the unintended consequences of high-stakes accountability “off rolling” pupils less likely to succeed, teaching to the test, manipulation of the curriculum and small but significant number of “orphan schools” that none of the new “edu-providers” want.Several interviewees described a situation in which the government is attempting to oversee thousands of academies, through a muddle of local authorities, school chains, regional commissioners and the Education Funding Agency, as the “wild west”.Stories of poor financial management, even corrupt practices, in the independent state school sector persist. The antics at the Durand Academy, relieved of its funding agreement by the Department for Education, have been well documented and watched closely by neighbouring schools such as like LIlian Baylis. Last September the Wakefield City academies trust gave up all its schools. Recently the Bright Tribe academy trust has been in the news over transactions with companies linked to the trust’s founder.Phillips, who seriously considered academy conversion for his school but decided to stay within Lambeth local authority, believes the innovative instincts behind the early academies have evaporated in the rush for mass academisation. “The chains have over-expanded and it often becomes more about the preservation of the trust than about the pupils. In that situation, the children of the poor are most likely to suffer.”But perhaps the biggest weakness of the market has been the failure to guarantee enough good teachers – and challenging schools that struggle in performance measures often find it the hardest to recruit good teachers. “We have tripled the number of young people coming out of university with degrees but we haven’t increased substantially the number who are prepared to become teachers,” says Gary Phillips.“Young people want the kudos of entering a profession which is valued by their peers. There are too many bad case studies, often academy chains, being passed around and places where people don’t want to work.”Parent choice is here to stay, but the current lull in domestic policy could provide an opportunity for reflection on what has worked in the past 30 years and what could change in the future.Better local oversight of schools and stronger incentives for local collaboration, rather than national chains “cherry picking” little groups of schools, would be Phillips’ priorities. My own conclusions for what is needed now include reform of school admissions and a broader definition of what we mean by success, one that goes beyond simple test and exam results.Thirty years on we may be ready for another all-encompassing Education Reform Act. “But that would require great political leadership now,” says Gary Phillips. I agree with that.The Best For My Child.

The review will decide whether and how the current fees and loans system should be changed.The government abolished maintenance grants, designed to cover costs such as food, rent and books, from the 2016-17 academic year. They were replaced by loans – in addition to the £9,250 a year tuition fee loan – with students from the lowest income families able to borrow the most.Many argue that it is indefensible that students from the poorest families now leave university with the biggest debts – an average of £57,000 according to an analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year. And the National Union of\u0026nbspStudents says that many working-class students still don’t have enough money to cover their daily\u0026nbspneeds, with many struggling to pay for food or heating.But experts also say the government is betraying students from middle-income families, by “refusing” to warn parents that they are expected to top up the loans for living costs. This can be as much as £4,500 a year for parents of students living outside London, and up to almost £5,000 a year for those in the\u0026nbspcapital.In its submission to the higher education funding review last week the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank attacked the government for failing to publish any information about these costs. Hepi’s director, Nick Hillman, said: “It’s a hidden nasty in the system. Most families don’t have £4,500 just lying around.”Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer website Moneysavingexpert, which has published its own breakdown of expected parental contributions, says it is “an absolute abomination” that the government is leaving parents in the dark.“If you aren’t entitled to a full maintenance loan, parents are expected to make up the gap, but what is outrageous is that the Student Loans Company tells you nothing at all about this,” he says. “It leads to friction in families and to students being underfunded.”Many families will just be trying to get to grips with university living costs as they apply for student finance – the deadline for which is this month. Rachel Wylie, from Wells in Somerset, whose daughter is hoping to start a textiles degree at Loughborough University in the autumn, says: “We’ve been to information evenings at school and they told us the government assumes you will top up the loan, but the Student Loans Company didn’t make that clear. If I hadn’t turned up I simply wouldn’t know.”Wylie, who works in health education, says: “We’ve had a university savings pot, but it isn’t enough money to cover everything, so we are definitely going to have to make some sacrifices.”She says that even if her daughter were entitled to the maximum loan for living costs it wouldn’t cover the full costs of living in halls of residence.Claire Callender, professor of higher education at Birkbeck, University of London, and at University College London’s Institute of Education, says: “I think one of the problems for the government is the politics behind telling parents – who are of course voters – exactly how much money they should contribute.”She adds that parents may resent the government telling them how much they have to put in from their own pockets – especially if they can’t afford it.A report on poverty among working-class students by the National Union of Students last month found the new maintenance loans “routinely” fell short of funding average student living costs, with many students unable to pay for enough food or heating.Ruth Wilkinson, president of Kent University Students Union, says: “I know students who are living hand to mouth. They are working as hard as they can in paid jobs in addition to their studies, and every spare penny after paying for their accommodation goes on food.”She adds: “We end up talking to some of the students who are really struggling because they turn up to our events knowing there will be free food. They aren’t paying for heating in winter as that’s a luxury. They are living in damp, mouldy flats trying to study.”The NUS says that the cost of renting a room in student halls has soared in recent years, and now typically exceeds what is affordable with the government maintenance loan. They are calling for universities to demonstrate that they provide some cheap accommodation for lower income students as part of the access and retention agreements they have to make with the government’s access regulator.The NUS and the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK have both called on the government to reinstate maintenance grants. Last week Hepi described the abolition of grants as “a big error”, and backed calls for them to be brought backYet the think tank noted that this could cost taxpayers in the region of £2 billion a year.But Lewis argues this would be a waste of money. “If you want social equality you’ve got to face the fact that students haven’t got enough money to live on. The loans aren’t big enough. So I wouldn’t lower tuition fees, or bring back maintenance grants, I’d boost maintenance loans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52ca83df70a4437839922a36439e22b801a4e8dc/0_244_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646ed41f7d3f9dcca07f7db8a9d764a6","title":"met gala 2018 pageantry and performance on the red carpet in pictures","story":"The 70th annual Met Ball was themed Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f83ca7af2941fd4734126958e364ee60b6b69099/195_534_1610_966/master/1610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eda6c22fa20213f8c4a7c96a4120076","title":"cannes 2018 top 10 film festival","story":"Asghar Farhadi goes Spanish, Spike Lee delivers a biopic of the black police officer who infiltrated the KKK – and Lars von Trier returnsA passionate, mysterious love story in postwar Poland between a musician and a young singer recruited as part of a communist-approved folk music troupe.Debra Granik, who directed Winter’s Bone, comes to Directors’ Fortnight with this fascinating, subtle wilderness story of a man (Ben Foster) who takes his 13-year-old daughter to live with him in secret in a public park.A Spanish-language thriller from the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi.

It’s not always about the technical and tactical things but about managing the biggest games on the biggest occasions and Katie’s done that year in year out throughout her career.”Chapman’s first FA\u0026nbspCup win came after her first season in the Millwall Lionesses first team aged 14. “I remember I was playing left side of a back three! It was a long, long time ago, for me a magical moment. It was at Selhurst Park, a big stage back then, the crowd was only 3,000 people so to see the crowd of 45,000 now is unbelievable,” said Chapman.When Chapman joined Chelsea from Arsenal, where she won a historic quadruple, Hayes and her assistant manager, Paul Green, were at the beginning of their build and Chapman has been their leader, now things have changed: “It’s so refreshing for us to see so many leaders throughout the lines now that there’s not a reliance on Katie to just do that. As a result of that Katie can just get on and express herself,” Hayes said.The midfielder’s trophy-laden career is all the more impressive when you factor in the three breaks for pregnancy and Hayes puts Chapman’s longevity at the top down to having children.“Everybody who’s become a mother tells me – so I’m looking forward to this – that it increases your red blood cells so you can run longer, you become better endurance runners, and Katie is insistent that because of the birth of her three children she runs more and more,” Hayes said with a smile.“Listen, she’s in impeccable shape – physically, she’s probably our most dominant athlete – but it’s the quality she has as a leader, as a person and as a footballer that sets her apart. She loves this football club.“The first words she said to me when the whistle went were: ‘It’s so easy playing with this team,’ and I think that’s what has become different in Katie’s time. We’ve turned into a team that’s got it all over the pitch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc23885e68c1cc6200f610ee4b056132a17b7016/15_7_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a745a93840a889f5a9c70d60789992f7","title":"carlos carvalhal mark hughes premier league relegation swansea southampton","story":"The showdown for Premier League survival between Southampton and Swansea could be won in the mindCarlos Carvalhal stressed the need for emotional control from Swansea and Mark Hughes was preaching a similar message when he talked about calmness being the key for Southampton, although playing the game and not the occasion promises to be easier said than done at the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday night in what is essentially a relegation play-off.Level on points with only two matches remaining, Swansea and Southampton meet in a survival showdown that promises to make for captivating viewing for the neutral as both clubs chase the victory that would put them within touching distance of safety. It will be a match riddled with tension and, according to both managers, played in the mind as much as with the ball.“You have got to deal with pressure,” Hughes said. “You have got to think clearly. Obviously, when things are flying around, you have to try to do the right things and you have to take your chances when you create them.”Southampton, by virtue of their superior goal difference, have their noses in front and also have some momentum after taking four points from their past two games to overhaul Swansea, even if they departed Goodison Park feeling bitterly disappointed after conceding an equaliser against Everton in the sixth minute of added time.“We just mustn’t allow ourselves to be deflated by what’s ahead of us and what’s just occurred,” Hughes said. “We played well. We are not down, in terms of confidence and in terms of how we are playing. We were damaged because we got so close to getting a significant result and a significant victory, which clearly would have helped our situation. But it is still very much in our hands. We will get this out of our system and go again.”Swansea have picked up three points from their past seven games, sucking them back into the bottom three in the final week of the season. The victories have dried up, and so have those colourful Carvalhal metaphors, amid a frustrating run during which Swansea have scored only twice and, in the eyes of the fans who chanted “attack, attack, attack” during the second half at Bournemouth on Saturday, played far too many matches with the handbrake on.Carvalhal bristles at any criticism of his tactical approach or Swansea’s form, insisting nothing has changed other than more difficult fixtures since that terrific run of results that followed his appointment at the end of December.The former Sheffield Wednesday manager also continues to come across as overly relaxed and confident, so much so that he was asked after the defeat at Bournemouth whether he needs to find a way to get his own positive demeanour and messages across to his squad. “I believe in myself and I believe in my players,” he said.With Swansea’s final game of the season at home against relegated Stoke, a draw against Southampton would not be disastrous. A defeat, however, would leave Swansea hanging on to their Premier League status and pinning their hopes on beating Stoke and Huddersfield losing their final two matches, against Chelsea away on Wednesday and Arsenal at home on the final day, in order to pip David Wagner’s side on goal difference.Southampton host Manchester City in their last game, which makes, on the face of it, the Swansea match all the more important. “Everybody is writing off the Man City game in terms of what we can take out of that. We are not and we won’t allow that,” Hughes said. “We will try our utmost to get something out of that game as well. But clearly when you are in this situation you want to be able to damage the teams around you, and Swansea are very much the team we have to damage.”Southampton will have to make at least one, and possibly two, changes given Maya Yoshida is suspended after being sent off at Everton and Mario Lemina was withdrawn with a hamstring injury in that 1-1 draw. The main decision for Carvalhal revolves around whether to persevere with five at the back or set up more offensively and take the view that fortune favours the brave.Either way, there is no escaping that it is approaching do-or-die time for both clubs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e8962feb2dcf602a4f9b641b7614dfc60815719/465_439_3376_2026/master/3376.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ad8498826f267a3328ad338c5793fb7","title":"predicting which players successful managers guesswork","story":"Great players do not always make successful managers. Will the Liverpool legend be a Zinedine Zidane or a Gary Neville?When Ross Wilkins stood up during his late father’s memorial service at St Luke’s Church in Chelsea last week to address a congregation that included many of the great names of the past 40 years of English football, he found the words to express a poignant truth. “Football found a way to live without Dad,” he said, “but the simple truth was that Dad could never live without football.”After calling time on his long and distinguished playing career, Ray Wilkins stayed in the game, as so many do. The next 20 years were spent in a variety of dugouts, as the manager of Queens Park Rangers, Fulham and the national team of Jordan, as well as assistant manager of Chelsea, Watford, Millwall, Aston Villa and England’s Under-21s. None of those appointments, it could be said, ended well.Even a happy and fulfilling time as assistant to his friend Carlo Ancelotti at Stamford Bridge was abruptly and mysteriously terminated a few months after the pair had celebrated winning the club’s first league and Cup double. In October 2015, he left his last job, dismissed by Aston Villa along with the entire coaching staff. He reverted to his role as a popular pundit on Sky Sports, but it was not the same thing.Intelligent, empathetic, articulate, steeped in football, a leader in the dressing room, Wilkins seemed to face no obstacles in the way of a management career to match his achievements as a player. But if there is one thing we can recognise, it is the impossibility of looking at a bunch of former players who have excelled at the game’s highest levels and guessing with any accuracy which of them will do equally well as managers. Or, for that matter, of predicting who will emerge from a thwarted or nondescript playing career to become a managerial immortal.The mourners at Wilkins’s memorial service included some who could count themselves successes in management (Antonio Conte, Roy Hodgson, Kevin Keegan, Glenn Hoddle) and others who could not (Gianfranco Zola, John Hollins, Bryan Robson, Peter Reid). Anyone who could have looked at those eight as their playing careers drew to a close and sorted the prospective managerial wheat from chaff would have deserved a gold medal for clairvoyance.Could it have been foreseen in 1974, when a former centre-forward named Alex Ferguson was pulling pints in his Glasgow pub while earning £40 a week as the part-time manager of East Stirlingshire, that he would devote a quarter of a century to rebuilding the biggest institution in English football? Or that Bobby Moore, playing his last game for West Ham that year, would be brought down by the lowest hurdles of management?Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard would impress any potential employer. Both won a century of England caps and most of the top honours on offer in club football. Each carries himself well, as Wilkins did. In their recent appearances as TV pundits, they have demonstrated insight and eloquence. Yet as these former international colleagues prepare for the first steps of a managerial career, riding a wave of support from those who admired their deeds on the pitch, only a fool would bet the house on which of them, if either, will survive the tests to come.Gerrard, having made a good impression during a year spent coaching age‑group teams at Liverpool, has already made his move into the spotlight by accepting an offer to cross the border and manage Rangers. Lampard, in an interview with this newspaper last week, made it clear he intends to follow suit once he has completed his Uefa Pro Licence course and served an apprenticeship with Chelsea’s academy.The portents are good and not so good. On the positive side, there were many who doubted that Zinedine Zidane, despite his great playing career at Real Madrid and several seasons coaching the club’s second string, would make a successful transition to the job of head coach at the Bernabéu. Now the man who presents such a seemingly taciturn and uncommunicative face to the outside world is just one step away from a third successive Champions League trophy, a feat that would carry him beyond José Villalonga, Miguel Muñoz and Vicente del Bosque to become the most successful manager in the club’s incomparable European Cup history.On the other hand, as Lampard and Gerrard will be painfully aware, there is Gary Neville, perhaps the member of their own England generation who looked most naturally suited to the manager’s chair. Hodgson must have thought so when he invited him to become one of his England assistants in 2012. But three years later Neville accepted an invitation from his friend Peter Lim, the Singaporean businessman, to take over as head coach of Valencia, a fine club in temporary difficulties. He spoke no Spanish, had never worked in La Liga and could rely only on the owner and his brother, Phil, who had been installed there as assistant caretaker manager, to help him get the club out of trouble. To make that work would have required a miracle, and four disastrous months in Spain appear to have ended the ambitions that had led him to earn his Uefa qualifications.Gerrard, it hardly needs saying, has never worked in Scottish football. At least, unlike Neville, he is going to a place where they speak a variant of his own native language. But expectations in Glasgow will be unrealistic and even minor mistakes will be held up to intense scrutiny. If he falls, it will be from a high place and the injuries could be severe.

But it does. Rippled into soft dough alongside butter, the toffee flavour of brown sugar and warm vanilla, miso offsets the sweetness, not unlike having salty bacon on syrup-sodden pancakes. It’s also no fuss to make these buns vegan, should you wish: just swap the butter for a vegetable-based butter alternative and use non-dairy milk.You can easily decrease the amount of miso here – it’ll still add a pleasing saltiness, even if you don’t add enough to taste the miso itself.For the dough75g unsalted butter300ml milk1 tbsp soft light brown sugar2 tsp vanilla extract10g dried yeast500g strong white flour1 tsp saltFor the filling75g unsalted butter, softened100g soft light brown sugar2-3 tsp miso paste1 tsp vanilla extract200g blueberriesFor the glaze100g icing sugar1 tsp vanilla extract20-25ml waterMelt the butter in a small pan, then add the milk and heat until lukewarm. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar, vanilla and yeast, and set aside for five minutes for the yeast to spring into action.Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, then pour in the milk mixture: you might not need all of it, so just keep adding it until the dough is soft and slightly sticky – if too dry, it’ll be tough and difficult to knead. Knead the dough for 10 minutes, until springy and smooth, then put in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and put in a warmish spot to rise.Meanwhile, for the filling, beat the butter with the sugar until smooth and fluffy. Add miso to taste: you might prefer just a hint of that saltiness, or maybe (like me) you’ll prefer a more full-on savoury kick. Stir in the vanilla and set aside.After 90 minutes or so, the dough should have more or less doubled in size (if not, leave it for a further 30 minutes). Roll it out on a lightly floured surface to a roughly 50 x 60cm rectangle. Spread with the filling, then evenly scatter over the blueberries. Roll the dough tightly from long edge to long edge, creating a swirled log. Trim off the ends, then ide into 12 equal portions using a large, sharp knife.Line a 20 x 30cm roasting tin with baking paper, then arrange the buns cut side up in the tin, spacing them evenly. Cover with clingfilm and leave to rise for 45-60 minutes heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.Once the buns are puffy and risen, put in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes. They’re ready when they’re golden brown on top, mottled with splashes of bubbling blueberry juice and springy to the touch. Quickly whisk together the glaze, gradually adding the vanilla and water to the icing sugar to get a smooth, very runny icing. Brush this over the tops of the hot buns using a pastry brush, then leave to cool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dab1fda712a218ffe82c35d8b85fdd484d8e0c7/329_267_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9ddbd818ec553676767c57c2b8e916","title":"simon mayo presenter salaries bbc radio 2","story":"Radio 2 DJ concerned policy is often pushed by those who seek to dismantle the corporationThe BBC Radio 2 DJ Simon Mayo has voiced his discomfort with the corporation’s policy of publishing its presenters’ earnings.Speaking alongside his new co-host for the revamped drive-time programme, Jo Whiley, Mayo also said it would have been unusual and not wise if he had been joined by another male presenter as part of the station’s schedule restructure.The BBC revealed last June that Mayo earned between £350,000 and £400,000. The presenter’s previous drive-time programme, which finished last week after eight years, attracted about 6 million listeners.In the same set of figures on presenters’ salaries, it was announced that Whiley earned between £150,000 and £200,000in her role presenting a weeknight show on Radio 2 that specialised in new music.In an interview with the Radio Times, Mayo said he was concerned that by publishing its talents’ salaries, prompted by heightened media scrutiny, the BBC could be endangering its future as a public broadcaster.“My worry is that it will become like a yearly turkey shoot and I think it’s often used as a stick to hit the BBC with,” he said.“The critics are saying, ‘Look at this, this isn’t right,’ but actually their broader agenda is dismantling the BBC, so that’s one of the reasons why it’s so uncomfortable.”Mayo and Whiley will fill the new Radio 2 drivetime slot between 5pm and 8pm from Monday to Thursday and on Fridays from 5pm to 7pm. The station has already confirmed both presenters will be paid the same amount for the show.Whiley, is the first female presenter on the station’s weekday daytime output since Debbie Thrower’s afternoon show finished in 1998.In the interview, Whiley said: “It’s ludicrous to think two people would be doing the same job and be paid different amounts of money because of their sex, that’s just unfathomable.“I don’t like talking about money at the best of times, but if it’s necessary to put things right, to correct the balance so that women are treated fairly and are paid fairly for the job that they are doing, then let’s discuss it, bring it on.”The full version of the interview with Mayo and Whiley can be read in this week’s edition of The Radio Times.

The researchers calculated that the combined depth of all of the schemes would be 15,289 metres, almost 50 times the height of the Shard.The study only covers the basements granted planning consent under existing properties. Other basements have been constructed under new homes. One new mansion in Notting Hill, on sale for £25m, includes a double-level basement with a 21-metre swimming pool.The researchers do not know how many of the basements they found have been built, because current planning law allows owners to commence work up to three years after permission is granted, with no deadline to complete. Several leading basement architects and developers said, however, that the vast majority of approved projects are completed.Other amenities uncovered in the research include 547 media rooms, 340 games and recreation rooms, 242 saunas or steam rooms, 63 underground garages and parking facilities, and one car museum. The study, undertaken for the , classified the basements into three size categories. Standard developments, of a single storey under the footprint of the house, made up four in five of the schemes. Their amenities were generally utilitarian, often containing extra living or utility rooms.The researchers also identified 785 large basements, of at least two storeys under the footprint of the house, or one storey extending well under the garden. Most were large enough to house a swimming pool.Another 112 basements were classified as mega, of at least three storeys in depth under the footprint of the house or two storeys in depth and extended under the garden. Some of the largest were up to 18 metres deep and bigger than the rest of the property above ground, warranting the nickname of iceberg homes.The most extravagant schemes include a three-storey basement in Holland Park, Kensington and Chelsea, with amenities including a swimming pool, plunge pool, beach, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, media room, gym and staff quarters. A three-storey scheme in Mayfair, Westminster, which was granted planning permission under an existing basement, features a swimming pool, cinema, car park, sauna, steam room and dance floor. A single-storey basement in Primrose Hill, Camden, includes a Turkish bath, Roman bath, cigar room, swimming pool, plunge pool, sauna, massage room, cinema, games room and bar, wine store, pilates room, gym and banquet hall.Roger Burrows, professor of cities at Newcastle University, said: “In many areas of ‘super prime’ London planning restrictions often makes it impossible to extend properties laterally or add floors on top. Consequently residential basement developments in the wealthiest parts of London have increased markedly.”The study shows how the size and splendour of basements varies across the seven boroughs. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster, the wealthiest boroughs surveyed, have the highest number of swimming pools.In contrast, the researchers found only three mega basements in Hammersmith and Fulham, and none in Haringey, Islington or Wandsworth.The Kensington and Chelsea MP, Emma Dent Coad, said the local council had once approved a three-level basement with a ing board. “I have sympathy for people who need more space for an expanding family, but building a beach under your mansion when you’re hardly going to be there is something else entirely,” she said. “While we have people sleeping on the streets we really have to look at what we’re doing in our borough because that is bad planning.”The streets with the highest numbers of basements granted planning permission include Tregunter Road in Chelsea with 22 and Hamilton Terrace in St John’s Wood with 16. Some of the latter basements extend to properties on the adjacent Hamilton Close.Sir Hugh Cortazzi, a former British ambassador to Japan, and his wife Elizabeth, who live on Hamilton Close, said the number of excavations under houses on the mews in the past decade had blighted their lives.“It’s depressing,” he said. “We’ve had huge dumper trucks blocking the mews. There’s still work going on. I fear the demand will go on and on.” Karen Buck, the MP for Westminster North, who has campaigned for tighter restrictions on basement developments, said: “The sheer opulence of many of the larger basement excavations caused jaws to drop even in fairly affluent neighbourhoods like St John’s Wood and Bayswater, where neighbours have sometimes found themselves under siege from these developments. And it wasn’t uncommon to be told that the building was scarcely occupied at the end.”The study found that council policies introduced to restrict the size of basement developments had led to a downturn in applications in recent years, but the researchers added that the numbers being granted approval in the past two years were similar to those in 2008-12, only now there were fewer mega-basements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8875b37c7868bcb0e835bb5c3c27b0cc1d232c01/0_202_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f58b2b8450bbbc2b9e3ef24010d11bc","title":"pool basement wealth super rich digging down london","story":"In London’s richest boroughs vast subterranean enclaves are being carved out over several floors to house cars, wine, saunas and private nightclubs. How did underground living – once associated with poverty and disease – become an investment scheme for the uber-wealthy?With its eclectic fusion of Regency and mythological motifs, Havona House stands out amid the stucco-fronted Victorian townhouses in Notting Hill’s Pembridge Villas. The newly built mansion’s mock neoclassical columns and the limestone carvings of Greek deities on the facade reflect the roots of its owner, property investor Costas Diamantopoulos. Stepping inside the 8,600 sq ft (800 sq m) property, which is on the market for £25m, you are confronted by an array of opulent features, including a free-floating stone staircase, hand-blown glass pendants and marble en-suite bathrooms.But the most extraordinary parts of this substantial home, just a short walk from bustling Portobello Road market, lie below ground in a double-level basement, which cost £4m to build. On its first floor is an underground garage, in which up to three cars can be parked via robotic platforms. On the lower floor is a 70ft swimming pool, which is filled by a waterfall that cascades over mirrored panels, with a cinema screen to the left. Mango onyx marble panels line the right-hand wall, with a Turkish bath, sauna, shower and a gym further on the other side. At the far end is a £30,000 plaster sculpture of four dancing figures, based on a painting by Poussin. The artwork also hints at the room’s special feature: at the push of a button, hidden hydraulic legs raise the ceramic-tiled floor to transform the space into a dancefloor. “In four to five minutes you can go from having a pool to a huge area of entertainment,” says Diamantopoulos.This is the second basement development Diamantopoulos has built in London in 10 years. He oversaw a much smaller one in 2008 under his former home in Cheyne Place, opposite the Chelsea Physic Garden, although it, too, has a pool, cinema screen, gym and sauna. This property is also for sale, for a comparatively modest £12m, under the terms of Diamantopoulos’s orce settlement. But he says his family regularly congregated in the basement when it was their main residence. He would swim in the oval blue-tiled pool, inspired by his childhood memories of the Greek islands, making use of the wave machine, or relax in the sauna, while his older daughter and her friends would use the gym. “If someone has the space and the ability, I would always recommend a basement,” he says.As decadent as they may seem, the features of Diamantopoulos’s basements are typical of many of those built under central London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods in the past decade, according to a new study by Newcastle University’s global urban research unit. The report, Mapping Subterranean London: the Hidden Geography of Residential Basement Developments, found at least 4,650 basements were granted planning permission in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Wandsworth between 2008 and 2017. According to their planning applications, these schemes boast at least 376 swimming pools, 456 cinemas, 996 gyms, 381 wine stores and cellars, 340 games and recreation rooms, 241 saunas or steam rooms, 115 staff quarters, including bedrooms for nannies and au pairs, 65 garages, 40 libraries, two gun stores, a car museum, a banquet hall and an artificial beach.The vast amount of extra space built under prime London properties contrasts starkly with the shrinking size of newly built homes bought by average families. For example, living rooms are nearly a third smaller than equivalent homes built in the 1970s, falling from 268 sq ft in the 1970s to 184 sq ft in a house built since 2010, according to another recent study. Burrows says: “One cannot but be struck by how the amount of living space different households have available to them differs now. In our research we have come across some basement developments in central London where just the pool, gym and cinema combined are larger than the newbuild rabbit-hutch homes that many people have to put up with.”Nowhere is this more evident than in Kensington and Chelsea, the capital’s richest borough, which has about 4,900 UHNWIs, and has the highest number of large and mega-basements, often two or more storeys deep and extended under the garden. Beth Holroyd, co-author of the study, says variations in the scale and sumptuousness of basements reveal the wealth gap between London’s merely rich, such as corporate lawyers and accountants, and the global super-rich, including bankers and oligarchs. Holroyd says: “There is a clear pattern of association between the level of neighbourhood affluence and both the size and extravagance of the basements. The pool is a clear marker of wealth.”On Tregunter Road, in the Boltons conservation area of Chelsea renowned for its Italianate Victorian housing, the researchers found 22 approved basements, with features including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Five of these basements are standard-sized, 11 are classified as large and six as mega. One of the mega-basements, with a pool, gym and car lift, is in an 8,000 sq ft townhouse on the market for £26m. Four of the basements are currently under construction. Outside one, a huge red crane lowers building materials into the rear garden, under which, planning documents suggest, a two-storey basement with a pool, cinema, gym, wine store, steam room, salon and staff room is being created. Another two-storey basement with almost identical features is being excavated under a house across the street.“I can see that from my garden,” says local resident Shirley, who lives round the corner on the Boltons, gesturing at the crane with her walking stick. “We’ve had something like that or worse going on for years. We’ve had incredible noise and vibrations. I’m sure there have been momentary gaps. Our feeling is it’s too extreme. Very wealthy people buy them hoping to get the price rise and do them up and sell them and the next person does the same. Only a few of them are here all the time.”Alistair Langhorne and Claire Bunten, directors of LAB Architects, have been designing basements in the Boltons conservation area since 2008. On a tour of the area, Langhorne says that even here most of their clients want a basement to enhance their family life, rather than for property speculation – although Bunten admits that the budgets for some schemes were “otherworldly”. “They’ve all probably got homes elsewhere in the world but this is their main residence,” adds Langhorne.The basement boom began in the late 1990s in Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth, according to architects and developers, with middle-class families renovating their Victorian coal cellars. Excavations became more substantial as planning constraints made building above ground in central London extremely difficult, while, from 2010 onwards, stamp duty rises on property purchases over £1m made the costs of moving prohibitive, forcing owners to expand downwards. Only 23 of the basements the Newcastle researchers identified in these boroughs have pools – compared with 224 in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea – and the vast majority are standard-sized – one storey under the footprint of the house.But Burrows believes that mega-basements will continue. “There will always be a few uber-wealthy types who seem immune to the vicissitudes of the economy, politics and local planning policies,” he says. “They always seem to find ways of getting around restrictions to build their luxury pools, galleries, cinemas or virtual reality golf courses. There may be fewer of those really massive basements now, but the trend is not finished yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e58b9c3e877741102a73ee6708bdafb0787a0439/0_84_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab19e08f0a61fb8c67429eec51ce308e","title":"love supreme at the roundhouse review adventurous engaging minifest","story":"Roundhouse, LondonBrooklyn trio Moon Hooch, with their dupstep basslines and a starring role for a traffic cone, were the most interesting act on a varied and impressive billLove Supreme, Britain’s big jazz and soul festival, has been running since 2013 in the lush gardens of Glynde Place and now attracts crowds of more than 40,000 each summer. To celebrate its fifth anniversary, and to preview next month’s festival, its organisers assembled this budget-priced mini-festival in Camden’s Roundhouse.With so many jazz heavyweights already booked for this weekend’s Cheltenham jazz festival, this bill’s headline acts erred towards the poppier end of things. Keyboard player Cory Henry is the most engaging figure to emerge from the bafflingly popular New York fusion outfit Snarky Puppy, and he certainly has a charisma that’s rare for a keyboardist – a freewheeling, stage-hogging extroversion that’s reminiscent of Beastie Boys’ organist Money Mark. What he lacks is material. Covers of songs by Prince, James Brown and the Bee Gees each feature some fine pitchwheel-heavy solos from Henry and fellow synth twiddler Nick Semrad, but the band’s dense, airless funk-rock doesn’t really give anyone space to breathe.Conversely, the main headliner, Mr Jukes, had plenty of fine tunes but could do with a fraction of Henry’s stage presence. Many of us were shocked when the first album by this AvalanchesGorillaz-style R\u0026ampB project, God First (led by Jack Steadman, the singer of the distinctly average Bombay Bicycle Club), turned out to be rather good, and the standout tracks (Angels, Grant Green, Leap of Faith, From Golden Stars Comes Silver Dew) sound tremendous, as do the Wayne Shorter, Roy Hargrove and Lauren Hill covers. Unfortunately, the onstage optics – eight competent session musicians centred around the catastrophically unengaging Steadman on bass – let daylight in on the magic.Some of the most interesting music appeared on the minor stages, tucked away in small spaces around the Roundhouse complex. The downstairs Seckler Stage only holds around a hundred bodies and became absolutely rammed at times, not least for a rare appearance by the revered British saxophonist Steve Williamson. His intense modal improvisations feature tricksy Afro-Latin rhythms, superbly negotiated by the remarkable 16-year-old drummer Zoe Pascal. The room also hosted the poetic modal jazz of pianistsinger Joy Ellis (featuring the excellent Rob Luft on guitar) and singerguitarist Oscar Jerome (playing wonderfully odd R\u0026ampB tunes and putting his guitar through some strange, goth-style FX).An outside stage on the sunny first-floor terrace seemed to specialise in what has become a contemporary London micro-genre – the jazz musician duetting with a knob-twiddling DJproducer. South Londoners Joe Armon-Jones and Maxwell Owin mix spacey modal jazz piano solos with abstract samples. North Londoners Blue Lab Beats mix the Dilla-style loops of troll-haired DJ Namali Kwaten with the smooth-jazz solos of left-handed pianistguitaristbassist David Mrakpor. East London’s Soccer96 ply a punkier kind of rave, featuring drummer Max “Betamax” Hallett. All three acts benefit from outside intervention: when Soccer96 invited a shouty poet and saxophonist on stage, it sounded gloriously like Ornette Coleman joining Sleaford Mods.This spirit of adventure leaked on to the main Roundhouse stage with Brooklyn trio Moon Hooch, an unholy racket featuring tenor sax, baritone sax and drums. Their 45-minute set incorporated dubstep basslines, circular-breathing solos and a starring role for a three-foot traffic cone (inserted into the bell of Wenzl McGowen’s baritone sax). It’s a mix of high theatre and intense improvisation operating without a safety net, and was the most interesting act on this varied but impressive bill.• Love Supreme is at Glynde Place, East Sussex, 29 June-1 July.

By  Raj Patel and  Jason W MooreThe most telling symbol of the modern era isn’t the automobile or the smartphone. It’s the chicken nugget. Chicken is already the most popular meat in the US, and is projected to be the planet’s favourite flesh by 2020. Future civilisations will find traces of humankind’s 50 billion bird-a-year habit in the fossil record, a marker for what we now call the Anthropocene. And yet responsibility for the dramatic change in our consumption lies not so much in general human activity, but capitalism. Although we’re taught to understand it as an economic system, capitalism doesn’t just organise hierarchies of human work. Capitalism is what happens when power and money combine to turn the natural world into a profit-making machine. Indeed, the way we understand nature owes a great deal to capitalism.Every civilisation has had some rendering of the difference between “us” and “them”, but only under capitalism is there a boundary between “society” and “nature” – a violent and tightly policed border with deep roots in colonialism.First taking shape in the era of Chistopher Columbus, capitalism created a peculiar binary order. “Nature” became the antonym of “society” in the minds of philosophers, in the policies of European empires, and the calculations of global financial centres. “Nature” was a place of profit, a vast frontier of free gifts waiting to be accepted by conquerors and capitalists.This was a dangerous view of nature for all sorts of reasons, not least because it simultaneously degraded human and animal life of every kind. What we call “cheap nature” included not only forests and fields and streams, but also the vast majority of humankind. In the centuries between Columbus and the industrial revolution, enslaved and indentured Africans, Asians, indigenous peoples and virtually all women became part of “nature” – and treated cheaply as a result. When humans can be treated with such little care, it’s not surprising that other animals fare even worse under capitalism, especially the ones we end up paying to eat.Animals have been at the epicentre of five centuries of dietary transformation, which sharply accelerated after the second world war. The creation of the modern world depended on the movement of cattle, sheep, horses, pigs and chickens into the new world, reinforcing the murderous advance of microbes, soldiers and bankers after 1492. Capitalism’s “ecological hoofprint”, to use food scholar Tony Weis’s well-turned phrase, has become radically globalised ever since. In the half-century after 1961, Weis tells us, per capita meat and egg consumption has doubled, and the number of slaughtered animals leapt eightfold, from eight to 64 billion.To those with a romantic view of where their food comes from, uncooked meat appears to be a raw ingredient rather than a processed one. Quite the opposite. Feed and oilseed crops form part of what Weis terms “the industrial grain-oilseed-livestock complex”. Markets for grain made it possible for meat not just to become cheap food, but also to back financial instruments. Futures contracts in pork bellies, for instance, in turn require the uniformity, homogenisation and industrialisation of the crops they transform. Raw meat in the supermarket is, in other words, cooked up by a sophisticated and intensive arm of capitalism’s ecology.The environmental consequences of meat production are, of course, external to industrial agriculture’s bottom line. Nature is merely the pool from which animals are drawn and factory farmed, and the dump into which their, and our, waste disappears. The danger lies in believing the ision between nature and society is real, in seeing “factory farming” as an environmental question and “factory production” as a social question. Social questions are environmental questions, and vice versa.Chickens don’t turn into nuggets by themselves. Capitalists need cheap work. With the European invasion of the new world in 1492, that labour presented itself in the bodies of indigenous people. By the late 16th century, when Spaniards were desperately trying to revive silver production at the great silver mountain of Potosí, in present-day Bolivia, they began using the word naturales to refer to indigenous people. Through hard work and prayer, those indigenous people, and enslaved Africans, might find ine redemption through work and perhaps even, one day long in the future, entry into society as equals.Work was never meant to be fun. Consider the etymology of the French travail and the Spanish trabajo, each a translation of the English noun “work”: their Latin root is trepaliare, “to torture, to inflict suffering or agony.” But the way work works has changed.For millennia, most humans survived through more or less intimate relations with land and sea. Even those who didn’t were closely connected to the tasks and objects of labour. Human survival depended on holistic, not fragmented, knowledge: fishers, nomads, farmers, healers, cooks and many others experienced and practised their work in a way directly connected to the web of life. Farmers, for instance, had to know soils, weather patterns, seeds – in short, everything from planting to harvest. That didn’t mean work was pleasant – slaves were often treated brutally. Nor did it mean that the relations of work were equitable: guild masters exploited journeymen, lords exploited serfs, men exploited women, the old exploited the young. But work was premised on a holistic sense of production and a connection to wider worlds of life and community.In the 16th century, that began to shift. The enterprising Dutch or English farmer – and the Madeiran, then Brazilian, sugar planter – was increasingly connected to growing international markets for processed goods, and correspondingly more interested in the relationship between work time and the harvest. International markets pushed local transformations. Land in England was consolidated though enclosure, which concurrently “freed” a growing share of the rural population from the commons that they had tended, supported and survived on. These newly displaced peasants were free to find other work, and free to starve or face imprisonment if they failed.CAAIR’s recruits were predominantly young and white, but the majority of poultry workers are people of colour. Latinx immigrants are a vital force in US agriculture, and the delivery of their cheap work was made possible by class restructuring on two fronts. One, in the US, was a strong movement in the 1980s by newly aggressive meat-packing firms to destroy union power and replace unionised workers with low-wage immigrant labour. The other was the destabilisation of Mexico’s agrarian order after 1994 by the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which resulted in flows of cheap immigrant labour – unemployed workers displaced by capitalism’s ecology from one side of the US border to the other.A line on a map between two states is a powerful abstraction, one that has been used recently by the far right to recruit and spread fear, and for much longer by capitalists in search of ever cheaper and more profitable workers. Under capitalism, national territories, locally owned land and new migrating workers are produced simultaneously.With migrant workers came elite fears of the itinerant poor. In 17th- and 18th-century England, this panic resulted in harsh laws against vagabondage, and the development of charities to ameliorate the worst effects of enforced destitution. Threats of imprisonment moved the poor into waged work, an activity that took the intelligence, strength and dexterity of humans and disciplined them to productive labour using another modern invention: a new way of measuring time.If the practice of labour shapes capitalism’s ecology, its indispensable machine is the mechanical clock. The clock – not money – emerged as the key technology for measuring the value of work. This distinction is crucial because it’s easy to think that working for wages is capitalism’s signature. It’s not: in 13th-century England only a third of the economically active population depended on wages for survival. That wages have become a decisive way of structuring life, space and nature owes everything to a new model of time.By the early 14th century, the new temporal model was shaping industrial activity. In textile-manufacturing towns like Ypres, in what is now Belgium, workers found themselves regulated not by the flow of activity or the seasons but by a new kind of time – abstract, linear, repetitive. In Ypres, that work time was measured by the town’s bells, which rang at the beginning and end of each work shift. By the 16th century, time was measured in steady ticks of minutes and seconds. This abstract time came to shape everything – work and play, sleep and waking, credit and money, agriculture and industry, even prayer. By the end of the 16th century, most of England’s parishes had mechanical clocks.Spain’s conquest of the Americas involved inculcating in their residents a new notion of time as well as of space. Wherever European empires penetrated, there appeared the image of the “lazy” native, ignorant of the imperatives of Christ and the clock. Policing time was central to capitalism’s ecology. As early as 1553, the Spanish crown began installing “at least one public clock” in its major colonial cities. Other civilisations had their own sophisticated temporal rules, but the new regimes of work displaced indigenous tempos and relationships with the natural world. The Mayan calendar is a complex hierarchy of times and readings from the heavens, offering a rich set of arrangements of humans within the universe. Spanish invaders respected it only to this extent: they synchronised their colonial assaults to sacred moments in the calendar.As social historian EP Thompson observes in his seminal study Time, Work-Discipline and Industrial Capitalism, the governance of time follows a particular logic: “In mature capitalist society all time must be consumed, marketed, put to use it is offensive for the labour force merely to ‘pass the time’.” The connection of specific activities to larger productive goals didn’t allow for time theft, and the discipline of the clock was enforced by violence across the planet.Fights over the regulation of time continue even now. On US poultry lines, there is a federal law limiting the speed at which birds are processed: 140 birds per minute. The industry is lobbying to eliminate the limit, so that it can compete with factories in Brazil and Germany, where the rate is nearer 200 bpm. Worries about higher rates of food contamination and worker injury are being outweighed by the certain profit from more dead chickens.Capitalism has always experimented with every available kind of labour system simultaneously. A sugar plantation in 1630s Brazil, for example, would be easily recognisable as a modern industrial operation in, say, the Bangladeshi textile industry. Just as autoworkers on the line assemble simplified, interchangeable parts and fast-food workers manufacture standardised burgers, so did African slaves work specialised jobs in a simplified landscape of sugar monoculture.Behind the modern factory, there has always been a layer-cake of exploitation. Managers of factories were salaried more than the workers, who worked with raw materials acquired through various kinds of peonage and natural resource exploitation, and all of them depended on free domestic labour, usually from women. The global factory depends on a global mine, a global farm, and a global family.Hence the persistence today of slavery. One UN agency, the International Labour Organization, estimates there are 40 million people in slavery today, the majority of whom are women, many in forced marriages. Wartime work camps in, say, the Democratic Republic of the Congo supply the rare-earth metals such as tantalum that power the physical infrastructure behind the virtual economy.But just as management looks to find new ways to generate profit, so workers find ways to resist. Early capitalism’s great commodity frontiers – of sugar, silver, copper, iron, forest products, fishing and even cereal agriculture – were zones of experimentation in strategies of labour control in Europe and its colonies, and always spaces of conflict. Strikes, rebellions, negotiations and resistance characterised the application of capitalist work disciplines. Every resistance by labour was a new reason to bring in machines. Modern work regimes and technologies emerged from the crucible of experiments, strategies and resistances of early modern workers.Worker unrest in factories and slave rebellions, past and present, are linked not just because they are expressions of resistance, but because they are protests against the ecology of capitalism. Every global factory needs a global farm: industrial, technological and service enterprises rely on the extraction of work and cheap nature to thrive. The apps on your iPhone, designed in Cupertino, California, might have been coded by self-exploiting independent software engineers, and the phone itself assembled in draconian workplaces in China, and run on minerals extracted in inhumane conditions in the Congo. Modern manufacturing relies on layered, simultaneous and different regimes of work. And in response to every act of resistance against it, capitalism has moved the frontiers of work yet again.Hegemony over workers has been aided by cheap food, and the promise of a chicken in every pot. Cheap food has been central to the maintenance of order for millennia. But in the ecology of capitalism, that order has been maintained through planetary transformation.Since the 15th century, some land has become the exclusive domain of specific kinds of crops and crop systems: fields of monocultures designed to bring in flows of cash. Other areas were reserved to house those humans who had been excommunicated from those lands, to be better placed at the service of capitalists in cities. It was always a socially unstable geography, with low industrial wages supported by lower peasant wages supported by free gifts from nature, women and the colonies. After the revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries offered workers the promise of alternatives to exploitation, capitalist fears of urban uprising and communism reached fever pitch. To allay this existential dread, governments and foundations did not address inequality or exploitation. Instead, they funded the development of crops that would grow abundantly enough to provide cheap food and curb urban hunger.That it was urban, and not rural, hunger that troubled policy makers is vitally important. Food and employment for people in rural areas – where most of the world’s hunger was concentrated – were of little concern. Hunger began to matter politically only when the poor came to the cities and translated it into anger, and thence potentially into insurrection and a challenge to the rule of cheap nature. It’s here – in the bourgeois concern about that rule and its need for worker quiescence – that we find the origin of what came to be known as the Green Revolution.The aim was to breed varieties of cereals that might flow freely through urban areas. But the revolution wasn’t simply an agronomic transformation. It required more than magic seeds. In order for farmers to grow the crops, national governments had to subsidise the purchase of crops through agricultural marketing boards, to lay the infrastructure for irrigation, and to suppress political dissent around alternative food systems. The Green Revolution of the early- to mid-20th century was a package of reforms designed to prevent the revolutionary political goal of many peasants’ and landless workers’ movements: comprehensive land and agrarian reform.But the prodigious output did not reduce hunger. Wheat production in India soared, but the amount that Indians ate hardly improved. Hunger, particularly in an economy dependent on agriculture, doesn’t end if people remain poor: it doesn’t matter how much grain there is if you can’t afford to buy it. Indeed, it is a global phenomenon that from 1990 to 2015, prices of processed food rose far less than those of fresh fruits and vegetables, and that in almost every country today, the poorest part of the population can’t afford to eat five fresh fruits or vegetables a day.Although workers in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) saw an increase in their share of national income after the second world war, that reversed in the 1980s. This was a direct consequence of anti-labour policies that scholars aptly call “wage repression”. Given consistently low wages in the neoliberal era, it mak0es sense to look at cheap food as cheap not merely relative to wage costs but directly in terms of price. When we do, it emerges as no accident that one foodstuff whose price has fallen dramatically is chicken in Mexico – a direct consequence of Nafta, technology and the US soybean industry.Nafta originally excluded agricultural goods, but they were included at the insistence of the Mexican government, which wanted to “modernise” its peasantry by moving them from agriculture into urban circuits of industry. The strategy worked: Mexico’s campesino (“peasant farmer”) agricultural economy buckled, as evinced by the El Campo No Aguanta Más (“the countryside can’t take it anymore”) protests that spread throughout the country in 2003. Circuits of migration and pools of labour for US agriculture were the result. But at least the chicken was cheap.The imagery of the frontier lends itself to thinking only about land. But the past two centuries have witnessed a very different kind of frontier movement: the enclosure of the atmospheric commons as a dumping ground for greenhouse gas emissions. In the 21st century, agriculture and forestry (which includes land clearance for cash cropping) contribute between a quarter and a third of greenhouse gas emissions.This is inevitable, because they’re profoundly energy- intensive, and have become more so. That’s a big problem, because there are no more atmospheric commons to enclose, and no obvious way to keep the costs of climate change off capitalism’s ledgers. Nowhere is this clearer than in the faltering global farm, whose productivity growth has been slowing, just as it did for English farmers in the middle of the 18th century. Agro-biotechnology’s promise of a new agricultural revolution has so far been worse than empty – failing to deliver a new yield boom, creating superweeds and superbugs that can withstand glyphosate and other poisons, and sustaining the cheap food model that is driving the ongoing state shift in the world’s climate system.There is little reason to imagine that climate change won’t break the modern food system. Worse, industrial food production is a breeding ground for pandemic disease, and reasoned analysis suggests that the kind of concentrated animal-feeding operations that bring us cheap meat will also bring viruses that could decimate the human population. Again, this is nothing new. Just as early-modern climate change and the plague brought about the end of feudalism and the beginning of capitalism, so we face a future in which climate change and a vulnerability to big systemic shocks augur a dramatic end for capitalism’s ecology.We’re astute enough students of history to see that what follows capitalism might not be better. Around the world, fascism has emerged from liberalism’s soil. Yet precisely as capitalism’s bills come due, communities are both resisting and developing complex and systemic responses at capitalism’s frontiers. Around each of the seven cheap things that make capitalism possible – nature, work, care, food, energy, money and lives – there are movements that are developing alternatives. Whether in a globally reviving labour movement, in the Movement for Black Lives’ demands around food, reparations and local economic sovereignty, or the feminismo campesino y popular (“popular peasant feminism”) developed by the La Via Campesina peasant movement in Latin America to bring together concerns around food, care, nature and work, movements are both fighting and developing intersectional alternatives.John Jordan, an activist and co-founder of the UK’s Reclaim the Streets movement, argues that resistance and alternatives are “the twin strands of the DNA of social change”. That change will need resources and space to develop. If we are made by capitalism’s ecology, then we can be remade only as we in turn practise new ways of producing and caring for one another together – a process of redoing, rethinking and reliving our most basic relations.Adapted from A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things by Raj Patel and Jason W Moore, published by Verso on 22 May, and available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a245e76ef80ad6a33c83e3fe9a46a0805c1ace/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a84fabf1c750573b27a60746b3b3e02","title":"labour mps revive campaign for progressive alliance","story":"Clive Lewis and Jon Cruddas support working with other parties to topple ToriesMPs from different wings of Labour have reopened the debate on a progressive alliance within the party.Clive Lewis and Jon Cruddas have co-signed a letter in the  calling for the reinstatement of three party members who were summarily expelled for supporting a National Health Action party candidate in Jeremy Hunt’s constituency at the last election. Nearly 30 other party members have backed the call.Lewis is a frontbench Treasury spokesman on the left of the party, and Cruddas, a former aide to Tony Blair, has been a leading thinker in the party for most of the past decade. Neal Lawson, who chairs the pressure group Compass, which campaigns for a progressive alliance, argues that cooperation with other progressive parties at last Thursday’s local elections could have tipped the balance in close-fought councils.In the south London borough of Wandsworth, Labour came within a handful of votes of toppling the Conservatives. The Tories lost eight councillors, leaving Labour just seven seats away from what could have been a defining result for the party.Campaigners also point to the Liberal Democrats’ victory in Richmond, where, with the Greens, they gained a total of 28 seats to win the council back for the first time since 2006. In their letter, Cruddas and Lewis argue that a progressive alliance could have delivered as many as 60 seats for Labour at last year’s general election. That would have given Jeremy Corbyn a working majority in the Commons. But Labour has long rejected all local arrangements with other parties. The three members in Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency who were expelled last year – Steve Williams, Kate Townsend and Robert Park – were not alone. In Hastings, a Labour party member, Nicholas Wilson, who campaigned against Amber Rudd on an anti-corruption ticket, was also expelled. He won more votes than Labour needed to unseat the former home secretary, who had a majority of 346.Lawson said: “Politics in Britain is in a stalemate. Labour must give local parties the ability to negotiate progressive alliances as the best way to break the stalemate it worked in 2017 and again in the local elections last week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/578dd9495fdde449289f5c658a9afde3755a5406/0_179_1933_1160/master/1933.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02cead807f298c2fda11f1b0af39863f","title":"theresa may facing renewed turmoil over brexit options","story":"House of Lords, Irish government and unhappy Tories pile pressure on prime minister Theresa May is facing renewed cross-party pressure to accept membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) or risk defeat in the Commons.Peers vote on Tuesday night on a series of amendments as officials work to try to find a deal on May’s preferred option of a customs relationship with Europe that is acceptable to Brexiters and remainers in her cabinet, as well as MPs and EU negotiators.The policy paper rejected by the inner cabinet on the Brexit subcommittee last week has been withdrawn for further work and will not be discussed at this week’s regular meeting.A Downing Street source said: “It was agreed on Wednesday that more work needed to be done to flesh out the general principles agreed – no hard border and as frictionless trade as possible.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.The prime minister also came under pressure from Boris Johnson, who is currently in Washington trying to persuade Donald Trump to stick with the Iran nuclear deal. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the foreign secretary dismissed May’s customs partnership proposal as “crazy” and said it would create massive bureaucracy. The scheme involves the UK levying border tariffs on imports on behalf of the EU and refunding them where the imported goods stay in Britain. Johnson also condemned any system that prevented the UK from establishing its own trade policy and negotiating deals with non-EU countries, which is also the principle objection of Conservatives led by Jacob Rees-Mogg in the European Research Group.Meanwhile, the Irish government is concerned that many MPs and peers still believe that Dublin will back down at the last minute on the hard border.A source close to the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: “Westminster is mistaken if it thinks the Irish government will move. And it has no understanding of Leo Varadkar. He is someone who will do the right thing for Ireland. They think we’ll get to the last point of the negotiations – and the border will be the last thing – and we’ll move, and we won’t.” He insisted that the EU would defend Irish interests as fiercely as Dublin, but the Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, said the EU was being unrealistic, while Britain’s former ambassador to Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer, accused the EU of putting the Good Friday agreement at stake by “weaponising” the border issue.Tuesday’s amendment to the withdrawal bill has been tabled by the Labour peer Waheed Alli in a move that is infuriating party managers.They say the Commons already has the chance to influence the detail of the final orce arrangements because of an earlier amendment and fear the extra vote could jeopardise a move to remove the time and date of Britain’s departure from the EU from the face of the bill, which has nearly completed its passage through the Lords.The vote brings the simmering tension in the Labour party over its stance on Brexit back into the open. Chuka Umunna, the Labour backbencher who jointly chairs a cross party pro-Europe group with the Tory MP Anna Soubry, says it is time for Labour to be clear about where it stands.“The party must pick sides,” he said. “To oppose the single market is to be aligned with Jacob Rees-Mogg.” In an article in the Independent, Umunna argues that it is impossible to meet the party’s six tests on the Brexit deal without membership of both the customs union and the single market.The new round in the increasingly bitter battle over Britain’s future relations with Europe was triggered by the business secretary setting out how devastating customs checks would be for major employers such as the car industry. Clark said: “It’s an area in which we are strong, we are growing, the world is looking to our industrial strategy to the innovations that we’re making there. So this requirement to do what it takes to get that frictionless – minimum of frictions, is something that we’ve made a public commitment to and we need to make sure that we get that right.”Clark warned that thousands of jobs would be at risk without frictionless trade and insisted the customs partnership was still under discussion. His intervention was taken as a bid licensed by Downing Street to revive a project that Brexiters outside cabinet believed they had forced off the agenda. Rees-Mogg immediately claimed “project fear” was being revived. On Monday, another leading Brexiter, Michael Gove, praised an intervention on Twitter from Open Europe’s director Henry Newman, who argued that the customs union issue had been comprehensively debated and rejected in the referendum. On the remainers’ side, the former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said some Brexiters were behaving like toddlers. Writing on Conservative Home, Morgan said they were wrong to believe a customs union was being proposed only as a way of avoiding Brexit altogether. She insisted the only question was how to leave andwarned that the local election results appeared to show a party losing more and more support among younger voters and those who had backed remain.It has also emerged that the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, is in a stand-off with the chancellor, Philip Hammond – a leading remain voice in the cabinet – over his departmental budget. The chancellor is under pressure to find enough slack in the budget to ease the squeeze on public services. He is also one of the principle advocates of a Brexit deal that remains as close as possible to the EU in order to protect British industry and jobs. Fox’s department has a relatively small budget by Whitehall spending department standards. About £400m is spent on policy development, negotiators and overseas trade promotion.

He won last year’s Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. In December the  and Le Monde revealed a urine test submitted after stage 18 of the Vuelta showed excessive levels of the asthma drug salbutamol and he could yet be stripped of that title if he is found to have committed an anti-doping violation.In terms of Froome’s legacy, what happens on the roads in Italy over the next two and a half weeks of the Giro could be secondary to the recent publication of a study entitled “Futility of current urine salbutamol doping control”.The report published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology claims it is not feasible to determine a dosage level of salbutamol based on the results of a single “untimed” urine sample.Froome’s failed test recorded a level of salbutamol at 2000ngml, double the amount permitted by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Under new Wada rules there is an allowance made for specific gravity, in effect to take account of possible dehydration and urine concentration. It is understood Froome’s reading has been recalibrated to 1429ngml, which is still an adverse analytical finding and could lead to an anti-doping rule violation.Wada is standing by the test. A spokesman said: “Wada has conducted several studies on salbutamol and continues to conduct studies on beta-2 agonists. We believe the current threshold is solid considering the scientific literature published on salbutamol over the past 20 years. Based on the published and unpublished information in our possession, we see no reason to change the salbutamol threshold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac018d1e88db6478bb5baaa033115bbbfd6acc0/118_66_5085_3051/master/5085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82ddcb0319115e0dd0972708514e67ee","title":"stuart lancaster not interested harlequins pledges future leinster","story":"Stuart Lancaster is not interested in the vacant job at Harlequins and has ruled out a return to the Aviva Premiership in the immediate future.

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d9f2185faa8456b7b84589d76935db8b8211d8/0_268_5417_3251/master/5417.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=861de0d14ed8109c6413a40ed6adeba6","title":"social media copies gambling methods to create psychological cravings","story":"Methods activate ‘same brain mechanisms as cocaine’ and leads to users experiencing ‘phantom’ notification buzzing, experts warnSocial media platforms are using the same techniques as gambling firms to create psychological dependencies and ingrain their products in the lives of their users, experts warn.These methods are so effective they can activate similar mechanisms as cocaine in the brain, create psychological cravings and even invoke “phantom calls and notifications” where users sense the buzz of a smartphone, even when it isn’t really there.“Facebook, Twitter and other companies use methods similar to the gambling industry to keep users on their sites,” said Natasha Schüll, the author of Addiction by Design, which reported how slot machines and other systems are designed to lock users into a cycle of addiction. “In the online economy, revenue is a function of continuous consumer attention – which is measured in clicks and time spent.”Whether it’s Snapchat streaks, Facebook photo-scrolling, or playing CandyCrush, Schüll explained, you get drawn into “ludic loops” or repeated cycles of uncertainty, anticipation and feedback — and the rewards are just enough to keep you going.“If you disengage, you get peppered with little messages or bonus offers to get your attention and pull you back in,” said Schüll. “We have to start recognising the costs of time spent on social media. It’s not just a game – it affects us financially, physically and emotionally.”The pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling mechanism on our news feeds are unnervingly similar to a slot machine, said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist for Google who has been described as the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience.“You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing,” Harris wrote.We cannot know when we will be rewarded, and more often than not we don’t find anything interesting or gratifying, much like gambling. But that’s precisely what keeps us coming back.“The rewards are what psychologists refer to as variable reinforcement schedules and is the key to social media users repeatedly checking their screens,” said Dr Mark Griffiths, a professor of behavioural addiction and director at the International Gaming Research Unit. “Social media sites are chock-a-block with unpredictable rewards. They are trying to grab users’ attentions ... to make social media users create a routine and habitually check their screens.”Like gambling, which physically alters the brain’s structure and makes people more susceptible to depression and anxiety, social media use has been linked to depression and its potential to have an adverse psychological impact on users cannot be overlooked or underestimated.For instance, phone dependency, driven by high social-media usage, can lead us to think our phone is vibrating, or that we have received a message, even when we haven’t.“There are whole departments trying to design their systems to be as addictive as possible. They want you to be permanently online and by bombarding you with messages and stimuli try to redirect your attention back to their app or webpage.”Tech insiders have previously said “our minds can be hijacked” and that Silicon Valley is addicting us to our phones, while some have confessed they ban their kids from using social media.A key reason for this is because Facebook has become so entrenched in our lives: we can’t put it down.Behavioural psychologist, Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has conceptualised how people become attached to social media.“It starts with a trigger, an action, a reward and then an investment and its through successive cycles, through these hooks, that habits are formed. We see them in all sorts of products, certainly in social media and gambling. This is a big part of how habits are changed.”Once a habit is formed something previously prompted by an external trigger, like a notification, email, or any sort of ring or ding, is no longer needed, Eyal remarked.It is replaced or supplemented with an internal trigger meaning that we form a mental association between wanting to use this product and seeking to serve an emotional need.“The products are built to be engaging and what’s engaging for some is addictive for others, that’s clear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9ae6b7ea3f3575fd8345ddc53acdc54241e076/0_94_4004_2402/master/4004.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=604caba4d7f3e646436e058ec775b4ea","title":"vladimir putin russian president sworn in fourth term kremlin ceremony","story":"Russian president promises to serve people faithfully amid tensions with west and domestic discontent over povertyVladimir Putin has been sworn in for a fourth presidential term in a lavish Kremlin ceremony as tensions with the west rise and domestic discontent over poverty and wealth inequality simmers.State television began its live coverage of the inauguration on Monday with Putin, 65, apparently hard at work in his Kremlin office. He then walked down a long, red-carpeted corridor to a black limousine that whisked him to the nearby Grand Kremlin Palace, the former throne room of Russia’s tsars.Putin was applauded by about 5,000 guests as he entered the palace’s ornately decorated Andreyevsky Hall through colossal doors flanked by Kremlin guards. Among the guests were Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor, Steven Seagal, the former Hollywood action star who has become close to Russia’s political elite, and Alexander Zaldostanov, the leather-clad, tattooed leader of a pro-Putin motorcycle club.With his hand on a gold-embossed copy of the Russian constitution, Putin swore to serve the Russian people faithfully. He also hailed Moscow’s ability to stand up for it interests in the international arena, and what he called Russia’s traditional values.Despite the pomp, the ceremony was relatively low key compared with Putin’s return to the Kremlin in 2012, when his black motorcade sped through deserted streets that had been cleared of residents by heavy-handed security forces. A Kremlin banquet to mark the inauguration was reportedly scrapped over fears it would lead to public criticism. Barring a change to the constitution, Putin’s fourth term is likely to be his last as president. He recently laughed off suggestions that he could return to the Kremlin in 2030, when he will be eligible to stand again. Government officials have not discussed the issue of his successor publicly, and analysts say the issue is taboo within the Kremlin walls.Since his last inauguration six years ago, Putin has seized Crimea from Ukraine, triggering western economic sanctions, and ordered Russia’s military into Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad. Russia has been a useful bogeyman since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. UK military chiefs were spooked when\u0026nbspRussia, during an intervention in Ukraine, used a combination of drones and artillery to destroy Ukrainian armour, and raised questions about whether the UK would be able to do much better than the Ukrainians in similar circumstances.The UK is far enough away for Russia not to pose a territorial threat. But UK forces are deployed in the Baltic states along with US and other Nato forces as a deterrent in the unlikely event of a Russian landgrab.Russia does present a threat through hybrid warfare, or the use of deniable acts of disruption – primarily cyber-attacks on the UK that could disrupt essential services or interference in the democratic process, such as in elections.Just weeks before his election victory in March, Putin presented what he said were Moscow’s invincible new nuclear weapons, his bellicose speech accompanied by an animated video that showed Russian warheads falling on Florida. Fyodor Lukyanov, a political analyst who sometimes advises the Kremlin, has described the current standoff with the west as a state of cold war.Monday’s inauguration ceremony came just two days after Russian security forces assisted by Cossack fighters detained hundreds of people, including the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, at an anti-Putin protest in central Moscow. The EU condemned “police brutality and mass arrests”, and human rights figures demanded an investigation into why Cossacks had been allowed to attack opposition supporters, including with leather whips. Russian opposition media said on Sunday that Moscow city hall has paid a pro-Kremlin Cossack organisation almost £190,000 to ensure public order in the Russian capital.Putin, who has ruled Russia for longer than anyone except Joseph Stalin, begins his new six-year term of office as an economic downturn has plunged millions of Russians into poverty. Russia’s economic slump has also meant an increasingly vicious struggle for resources among the country’s government and security apparatus, analysts say. Alexei Ulyukayev, the country’s former economy minister, was jailed for eight years in December on corruption charges that were widely interpreted as a rare case of Kremlin infighting spilling out into the open. The recent jailing of state security officials on corruption charges is also evidence of “intensified competition” for financial resources between officials at Russia’s interior ministry and the FSB intelligence agency, said Yekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political analyst.Opposition figures, who accuse Putin of caring only about the economic interests of his friends and family members, reacted with scorn to the former KGB officer’s inauguration pledge to serve ordinary Russians. “Putin said Russians will live better, but he didn’t say which ones,” read a popular online joke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb3aa2a847b025f36c7809ce2ed7a6bc5410cb4/0_263_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47b99e06b305a33465e7962fb1a80478","title":"canadian activists pipeline tiny homes british columbia","story":"Much of Kinder Morgan pipeline’s proposed route lies within Secwepemc territory, and locals describe their fightback as ‘a matter of life and death’In the heart of the Canadian province of British Columbia, dozens of activists have been gathering to saw lumber, raise walls and install windows. By the time their work is done, 10 tiny homes will have been built – all in the name of thwarting a pipeline.Launched by a group called the Tiny House Warriors, the plan is to strategically deploy the homes to block the the expansion of the a pipeline running from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific coast.More than half of the Trans Mountain Expansion’s proposed route lies within Secwepemc territory, home to 17 First Nations bands and the world’s only inland temperate rainforest.“Our land is our home,” said Kanahus Manuel, who helped to launch Tiny House Warriors last year. “We’re putting tiny houses out there to scream that message to the world: pushing a pipeline through is tearing through our home.” Efforts to stop the pipeline expansion have heated up in recent weeks, and thousands of people have joined indigenous-led protests in British Columbia.The project, which still needs to obtain numerous local permits and approvals, has pitted the provincial governments in Alberta and British Columbia against each other. The pipeline would nearly triple the flow of the province’s landlocked bitumen to the west coast, but British Columbia fears the dramatic increase to oil tanker traffic in the Pacific could have an impact on its multibillion-dollar tourism industry.The pipeline’s owner, a subsidiary of the Texas-based energy company Kinder Morgan, announced it would walk away from the project unless it saw a clear path to completion by the end of May.Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, said his government was prepared to use taxpayer dollars to push forward the pipeline, which he described as “a vital strategic interest to Canada” .In Secwepemc territory, which stretches across a wide swath of south-central British Columbia, the battle against the pipeline rings personal. “We feel like it’s a matter of life and death,” said Manuel. “We’ve depended on this land for tens of thousands of years. That’s the risk that we’re facing with the pipeline. And the uncertainty is whether our kids are going to be able to drink this water in 50 years.” Last year a Secwepemc assembly declared its opposition to the pipeline, even though three of the territory’s bands have signed agreements allowing the pipeline access. Among those supporting the project is Simpcw First Nation, who say they hold the title to one-third of the land that the pipeline aims to traverse. But those behind Tiny House Warriors point out that 17 bands call Secwepemc territory home. “No one person could sign over land that’s going to impact our collective right and title to our territory,” said Manuel.The territory is unceded, meaning no treaties were ever signed between Canada and the Secwepemc.At a build site 50km east of Kamloops, the group has so far built two of the tiny homes and a third is nearing completion. Secwepemc muralists and other artists will decorate each home with images drawn from the community’s traditional stories.The idea of using tiny houses seemed like a perfect fit to express the assembly’s opposition, said Manuel: juxtaposing a symbol of sustainable living against the environmental threat posed by the Trans Mountain project.What’s more, the homes can be built quickly and – because they are mobile – be moved around easily, assuaging the concerns of those who were part of a 2001 attempt to block the construction of a ski resort on their hunting and medicine-harvesting grounds.During that protest, community members built a cordwood house and a cabin on the land in hopes of hindering the development, only to watch as their work was bulldozed and members slapped with trespassing charges. This time the structures will be on wheels, said Manuel. “We didn’t want to be targeted and caught up in injunctions,” she added. “That’s not what we’re here for. We’re here to stop a pipeline.”The solar-powered homes will be used to house families in need, and some will likely be set aside to house language and cultural camps. After funds from Greenpeace helped to build the first house, crowdfunding campaigns enabled the group to easily raise the approximately C$5,000 needed to cover the cost of each house.As the May deadline for Kinder Morgan approaches, Manuel is hoping the small homes will offer a big platform for those in the community who have concerns over the project.“We know how it is when people see the militant, camouflaged masked-up native blocking the road or burning tires,” she said. “We know that that’s the frustration and the rage that a lot of our young people feel. But we know that we need to be creative because we know they have bigger guns, more handcuffs and police to take us away. We have to be creative with our resistance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/802120709c90237b776a68560c56e2380aedb96c/0_13_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e14b4f028ac3ea044eca02e53ac7ff0a","title":"slaves working in uk construction and car washes report finds","story":"Labour abuse authority finds 17 sectors of British economy are high-risk for exploitationExploitation and abuse of workers is widespread across the UK economy, according to a new report, which finds that 17 sectors are high-risk for mistreatment ranging from wages theft to slavery.Construction, recycling, nail bars and car washes were among the top sectors where the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) said there was slavery. Agriculture, food packing, fishing, shellfish gathering, warehouse and distribution, garment manufacturing, taxi driving , retail, domestic work, and social care were also highlighted in the report.The authority has new powers to investigate labour abuse in all sectors under the 2016 Immigration Act, and the report marks its first full year of work assessing the nature of the problem in the UK. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority had previously been limited to tackling abuse in the agriculture, food and shellfish sectors. “It’s not until now that we’ve had the ability to look, but it’s a case of the more you look, the more you find,” said Ian Waterfield, the GLAA operations director. The authority says measuring the prevalence of labour exploitation is difficult, but an increasing number of suspected cases are being reported.About 150 years after most countries banned slavery – Brazil was the last to abolish its participation in the transatlantic slave trade, in 1888 – millions of men, women and children are still enslaved. Contemporary slavery takes many forms, from women forced into prostitution, to child slavery in agriculture supply chains or whole families working for nothing to pay off generational debts.\u0026nbspSlavery\u0026nbspthrives on every continent and in almost every country. Forced labour, people trafficking, debt bondage and child marriage are all forms of modern-day slavery that affect the world\u0027s most vulnerable people.Slavery exists in one form or another in every country. Asia accounts for more than half of the ILO\u0027s 21 million estimate. In terms of percentage of population, central and south-east Europe has the highest prevalence of forced labour, followed by Africa, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.In 2005, the ILO estimated that illegal profits from forced labour amounted to more than $44bn. The UN\u0027s global initiative to fight trafficking says\u0026nbsppeople trafficking is the third-largest global criminal industry\u0026nbsp(pdf) behind drugs and arms trafficking. The ILO estimates that people in forced labour lose at least $21bn each year in unpaid wages and recruitment fees. Slavery also exists within global supply chains, generating huge profits for those who control this industry in free labour.The report also finds that organised crime groups are active in the labour market in many sectors. Most intelligence about victims of labour exploitation in the last 12 months has related to Romanian men in their 20s and 30s, while Romanian and British nationals are the most prevalent offender nationalities across all forms of modern slavery. Albanian organised crime is a significant factor in abuse in car washes. Long shifts of 12-15 hours a day, sometimes seven days a week, wages below the legal minimum or not paid at all, and dangerous working and living environments were issues common to several sectors. But different sectors also had problems specific to them. In nail bars the victims of trafficking for labour exploitation were mostly Vietnamese, with evidence that tax fraud and money laundering was also taking place. In the agriculture sector, the GLAA found evidence of 15-hour days, sometimes seven days a week, with double shifts without proper breaks, illegally low pay, serious safety incidents going unreported, and very poor living conditions. Romanian and Bulgarian workers were currently most at risk in this sector. Criminal groups were reported to be trafficking foreign workers into the food processing sector, with licensed companies warning they were being undercut by unlicensed ones.Wages in food service, hotels and catering could be as low as £10 per shift, with some employees working up to 15 hours a day, and sleeping on floors. In car washes, the GLAA found trafficking, 12-hour shifts seven days a week, wages below the legal minimum, dangerous accommodation on site, and exploitation of undocumented workers. Romanians made up the largest number of victims. Convoluted supply chains and subcontracting makes the UK construction sector, employing about 3 million workers, high-risk too. Its widespread use of self-employment contracts is directly linked to exploitation, according to the report. Gangmasters operating in the UK are also moving workers around internationally to meet shifting demand on building sites. The chair of the parliamentary select committee for work, Frank Field, said both government and consumers needed to wake up to the scale of abuse. “This report sheds much needed light on some of the most rotten, grotesque and evil practices that afflict the bottom of our labour market. Slave labour is being used to prop up companies in large swaths of the economy. What is puzzling is how the government machinery and consumer backlash have yet fully to come to terms with this phenomenon.” The NGO Focus on Labour Exploitation (Flex), which has recently researched the construction sector, said lack of resources was undermining government efforts on modern slavery. “Labour abuses put workers at a high risk of exploitation, with growing numbers in modern slavery – migrant and UK workers alike. We must urgently reverse the huge cuts to labour inspection in recent years,” its director, Caroline Robinson, said.Dumitru Popescu, a 41-year old Romanian, is one of the thousands of migrant workers who make up half the labour force in London’s construction industry.He had just finished a trial shift, working from 7.30am until 5.30pm without a break, demolishing a block of flats with hand tools because machine digging was prohibited. Compared with his previous job, this was good work and he wanted to keep it, so he was trying to calculate what he needed to pay the two Romanians who controlled employment on this site. He said that giving a cut of your wages each week to supervisors as protection money was how the system worked. Newcomers were given the most back-breaking jobs by paying his fellow Romanian overseers the right amount he would gradually move up the pecking order and stay safe on the same site. But how much that amount should be was not clear. He thought probably £50 a week but it was an anxious decision. Pay too little and you would be moved on and back to the bottom of the pile too much and you would be subsidising them to stand around while you sweated, he explained.Popescu (not his real name) has a contract with a large, high-profile recruitment agency which supplies thousands of workers for sites around Greater London. On paper, arrangements look fine and much better than queueing by the road in the places where contractors pick up day labour. He is paid £9.15 per hour – above the minimum wage – with deductions for tax and national insurance, but he said he did not really understand the deductions and thought they were too high, even before the protection money.His first job on arrival in the UK had been as a casual worker in leading hotels where the hours were completely unpredictable, varying from 12 hours one day to four hours the next with no notice. He moved to construction, where the first company he worked for cheated him out of his pay so he cut his losses and moved on. He was taken on as a casual to work on a flat renovation but was never paid for most of his work, the owner claiming he had run into financial difficulties. With the agency he thinks he will be able to work seven days a week averaging 10 hours a day and so make ends meet. His wife is a qualified social worker back home but does hotel work now in between looking after their daughter. The three of them live in a single room in a four-bedroomed house he rents with three other families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a986193634555691ef5d5381b32e158a5bfac0e/500_590_2077_1246/master/2077.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d2aac5406d59fe412348083b1bf5192","title":"turkish cypriot newspaper afrika editor sener levent enemy recep tayyip erdogan","story":"Şener Leven has made his tiny Turkish Cypriot newspaper an enemy of Turkey’s presidentŞener Levent is on a mission. He has survived being set on by mob and two gun attacks and has had a dead dog left at his door, but none has not stopped the editor taking Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to task. With evident pride, he says his Turkish Cypriot newspaper, Afrika, is the only Turkish-language daily to denounce Ankara’s military offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. “I’ll continue writing the truth,” insisted Levent, who narrowly escaped being lynched in January when a mob of ultranationalists, incited by Erdoğan, attacked the publication’s premises in the Turkish-run north of Cyprus. “The Turkish army went into Syria and the Kurdish enclave of Afrin to commit a massacre and occupy the country, just as they did here.”Such defiance has not gone unnoticed. Media repression is at the root of growing international concern over Erdoğan’s increasingly authoritarian style. More than 150 journalists have been jailed, many on tenuous terror charges, following the failed July 2016 coup. Criticism of Turkey’s cross-border operation is high on the list of perceived infractions, which is why Levent’s newspaper is in Erdoğan’s sights. “It is a crime now to be a good person in Turkey because if you are good you are imprisoned,” he lamented, sitting behind a chaotic, paper-stacked desk. “It is even a crime to say ‘no’ to war in Turkey. No country is my enemy, but I am absolutely against Erdoğan’s and his Islamofascist regime. Why did he start this war? Because he needs this war to consolidate his power.”Afrika is one of 20 dailies produced in northern Cyprus, the breakaway republic where Ankara has stationed 35,000 troops since invading in response to a coup aimed at union with Greece in 1974.Run on a shoestring budget, its circulation is about 2,000. Its web presence is similarly limited. Even among Turkish Cypriots, Levent’s contrarian views – he refuses to submit to Ankara’s line that 1974 was a “peace operation” – are prone to eliciting derision. His own office, down a long, bare, dark corridor, is decorated with tapestries of Che Guevara and other leftwing heroes who like him, the 70-year-old bohemian laughs, were once dismissed as “marginals” and “provocateurs”.But while the editor clearly delights in his role as a gadfly, Turkish Cypriots have rallied around him. As Erdoğan seeks to crush dissent in the run-up to snap legislative and presidential elections in June, many are alarmed that Afrika should be singled out. Within hours of ordering the assault on Afrin, the Turkish president spoke at a rally and denounced the newspaper as “cheap and nasty”. He criticised the publication for comparing the Syrian offensive to Turkey’s actions in 1974 and exhorted his “brothers in northern Cyprus to give the necessary response”.The next day, Afrika’s first-floor premises were viciously attacked as flag-waving protesters, hurling bottles and stones, took up his call. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, again raised the issue of Afrika in March, appealing to his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Tufan Erhürman, to bring “the unpleasant voices” under control. All of which leaves Levent, who was born and raised on the island when it was a British colony, a little stunned. “It is crazy that such a powerful man should be afraid of such a small newspaper,” he said, his voice gravelly from Dunhill cigarettes. “I am very proud that we are the only Turkish-language newspaper writing about what is really happening in Afrin.” The building housing Afrika still bears scars from the attack. For more than a month after, Levent had the office’s smashed windows encased in thick chipboard, forcing staff to work in the semi-darkness. The balcony, which protesters tried to scale, was barricaded, enhancing the sense of siege. There is still blood on the wall and a gash in the office’s front door, a stark reminder of the bullet that pierced it when a would-be assassin turned up in 2011. Levent now has a CCTV monitor on his desk so he can keep an eye on the main entrance. Since the attack in January, he comes to work with a gun. “I thought there’ll be a battle here if they come again,” he said. He said he is still shocked that it had taken so long for the police to stop the assault given the building’s location between the parliament, presidential office and Turkish embassy. Police only responded when the enclave’s president, Mustafa Akıncı, intervened. While distancing himself from Levent’s views, Akıncı deplored the attack as an assault on freedom of expression.Soon after, thousands of Turkish Cypriots took to the streets to protest Turkey’s role in agitating “fascist” segments to silence Afrika and other voices of dissent. Six of the attack’s protagonists were rounded up and sentenced to jail terms of between two and six months. Another nine remain at large. His case has been raised with the EU by the government in the internationally-recognised Greek south. Although EU laws are suspended in the north, because of the island’s ided status, Turkish Cypriots are EU citizens.Levent acknowledges that the 40-mile channel that separates Cyprus from Turkey offers a measure of protection that mainland critics do not have, but he worries that the light sentences will invite further violence at a time when even a wrongly worded tweet in Turkey is considered a crime. “Every day I ask, where is justice? Why haven’t the others been arrested?” he said. “An attack can come tonight, tomorrow, any time. “I have a particular philosophy. I am not afraid,” he said, adding that Hamlet’s “readiness is all” speech guides him when the going gets tough. “A person lives once and dies once. If you are to die, at least die with honour.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481526.1525634953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house rules how to get your first mortgage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThings which help demonstrate a borrower’s desirability to a bank include savings and paying rent.

These plans are a reference to the current capital programme, which runs until 2021.In response, the department said the €2.5 billion sum allocated for the refurbishment of schools under the National Development Plan – which runs until 2027 – will allow for the upgrading of schools.However, an email from a senior official in the department – released under the Freedom of Information Act – indicates that many schools may end up waiting years for refurbishment works.The email says the construction inflation and energy requirements for new buildings mean there is “some, but very limited scope” for an increased focus on refurbishment towards the end of the 10-year period."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486983.1525710606!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lobsters and crabs walking around dublin bay with overcoat of silt on their backs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Underwater Council, representing some 2,000 ers, says its members had to cancel all planned es in Dublin Bay this year.

Clubs and instructors say the levels of silt particles in the water have made it too murky to undertake any ing this year, and lobsters and crabs are walking around with “an overcoat of silt on their backs”.As part of this project, which will allow cruise ships to be brought up the Liffey as far as the East-Link bridge and give the port the capacity to accommodate the largest freight vessels in use, the company is licensed to dump the dredged material at sea at the Burford bank, 5km southeast of Howth.“The seawater in Dublin Bay at the moment is filthy brown, somewhere between dark chocolate and milk chocolate. None of the local scuba ing clubs have been able to start ing as yet in 2018,” ing instructor Peadar Farrell said in a letter to The .The port company had extended its dredging and dumping season this year by using an older dumping at sea permit than the one secured as part of the Alexandra Basin project, Mr Farrell said.“Every plant, fish, filter feeder and living thing in Dublin Bay is now coated with a fine silt after the months of dumping,” he said. “As a er I see the lobsters, crabs and other life walking around with an overcoat of silt on their backs.”When the port company eventually achieves the depth required for the larger ships, it will have to continue regular dredging to prevent the tide restoring the seabed depth, he said. “They are turning Dublin Port into a very unnatural place,” Mr Farrell said.The port company said it was using two dumping-at-sea permits, issued at different times, but said it “operates both permits to the highest standards”.

Video: DFA\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit briefing: Michel Barnier was reporting back to the EU27 on his visit to Ireland (above). Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersIreland will be used as a key pressure point at a crucial summit next month to force the UK to clarify its future relationship with the EU, Michel Barnier has said.In a private briefing in Brussels last week, the European Union’s chief negotiator also insisted Brexit does not threaten the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and asked for “drama” to be taken out of the Border proposals.In a briefing to representatives of the EU27, the bloc’s remaining member states, he said the risk of a breakdown in the talks later in the year will be heightened if there is no “early progress on Irish issues”. He was reporting on his recent trip to Northern Ireland and Ireland. An account of his briefing was sent to Dublin by Irish officials.The briefing, elements of which have been seen by The , says Germany and France support the position that talks must not progress to a future EU-UK deal unless all elements of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal treaty are agreed. This includes the so-called backstop, which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border.The EU has proposed this would mean Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union after Brexit. That has been rejected by the British prime minister, Theresa May, and the DUP, which supports her Conservative government in a confidence-and-supply deal at Westminster.“France also shared Barnier’s view on the need to reach agreement on outstanding withdrawal-agreement issues, including Ireland, by June,” the notes say. “Germany said it was essential that the Irish issue was not left ‘open to the end and then isolated’.”Mr Barnier said the EU “had specific leverage points” at European Council summits last December and March. “In June, the primary leverage point will be to make clear to the UK that finalising the outstanding aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, ‘including on Ireland’, is a precondition to a constructive discussion on the future,” the account of his briefing said. Mr Barnier said the backstop does not affect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland but only sets out what checks are necessary after Brexit. He argued there are already checks between Britain and Northern Ireland for agricultural produce. “What he has learnt from his visit to IrelandNorthern Ireland is that all sides need to take the drama out of what is being proposed. Barnier repeatedly said he was moved by all communities in Ireland.”Speaking yesterday, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said Northern Ireland must “move in lockstep” with the rest of the United Kingdom. “We don’t believe we have to stay in the customs union to have free flow between ourselves and the Republic of Ireland.”A decision on the British government’s preferred customs option has been postponed after Ms May failed to secure the support of her ministers for a proposed hybrid “customs partnership” between the EU and UK. The arrangement would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the European Union for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state.

What we need to do now is reassure people whom I would see are in a similar category to myself, who accept it needs to be changed but aren’t quite sure how far it should go.”Speaking at a cross-party photo shoot for the Together for Yes campaign in Cork, Mr Coveney said he believed the key issue for the Yes campaign was to avoid “getting dragged into a nasty spat where it becomes hard-line pro-choice versus hard-line pro-life”.Mr Coveney said such a development would make a lot of people in the middle ground very nervous about voting for change and those were the people whom the Yes campaign needed to convince.“What we are proposing to do here is still protect unborn children, but we are deciding to rebalance the discussion around prioritising the health and lives of women particularly early on in pregnancy. “I think we need confront people with that and give some examples of why we need to do that,” he said. “You will not get a majority in the country saying, ‘Well I used to be pro-life but now I’m pro choice’, whereas you will get a lot of people saying, ‘Well I’ve always been pro-life but I can see that the restrictions the constitution imposes is putting a lot of women in cruel and impossible situations’.”Mr Coveney’s comments were echoed by Sinn Féin Cork North Central TD Jonathan O’Brien, who said he changed his views on the need for terminations when he sat on the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment. “The key to this is information and to be honest, if I didn’t sit on the Oireachtas committee, I wouldn’t be as far down the road as I am now. Going into that committee, I went in with a particular upbringing, a particular background and to be honest, pretty ignorant about the whole issue,” he said.Mr O’Brien said t he did not know what abortion pills were or how they worked until he sat on the committee. He believed if the Yes campaign presented people with clear and factual information, then it would succeed in persuading undecided voters.“I consider myself pro-life and that’s not easy to say because people have hijacked that label. We are not asking people to change life-long held views from pro-life to pro-choice. We are just asking them to prioritise women’s health and that’s how we should couch the debate to convince people.”Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here"},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3487191.1525722125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"campaigning for no i am upholding the proclamation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOffaly TD Carol Nolan canvasses for a No vote in Tullamore. Photograph: Tom Honan“I was bound by my conscience. The party was led by its policy.”With two terse sentences, the Offaly TD Carol Nolan describes the gulf that has grown between her and the Sinn Féin leadership over the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment.Nolan and the Meath West TD Peadar Tóibín have found themselves at odds with their parliamentary party colleagues on this issue.While isions have emerged in all parties, the difference with Sinn Féin is it does not countenance votes of conscience. Nolan has been suspended from the party for defying the whip on the vote for the referendum.Nolan, a former teacher, is a new TD. Elected in 2016, she was seen as one of the party’s quieter TDs.But on this issue she has been outspoken. She has been openly canvassing for a No vote at every available opportunity. That translates as a few nights each week, and also for the whole of the weekends. She has also addressed No rallies in Galway, Tipperary and Laois.On a blue-skied Friday night, she is one of eight people on a Love Both canvass in Ardan View, a 1970s estate across the road from the General Hospital in Tullamore.The canvass is led by former Fianna Fáil councillor Paddy Rowland who says it is great to have Nolan along. “She is instantly recognisable. People respect her because of her views and integrity.”It is no surprise that there is a big majority of Nos here. Yeses are few and far between. Some of the younger residents – men in particular – have yet to make up their minds, though.Nolan is canvassing with schoolteacher Claire Delaney, who has already canvassed here in February. Andy Lowbridge, a father of three young children, comes to the door and says he has yet to make up his mind, that it’s 50:50 with him. “We are getting a lot of literature. I understand the circumstances,” he says.In a long discussion, Nolan and Delaney set out the classic No arguments, the assertion that the change will usher in abortion on demand, and the trust factor with politicians.That resonates with Lowbridge. “If a politician told me told today was Friday (which it was) I would not believe them,” he says.Typical of the majority No sentiment is grandmother Marie Tyrrell. “A No vote will be mine,” she says. “I have seven (children) and am going to talk to them.”Canvassers Siobhán Flynn and Veena Lasrado Machedo have spent a long time talking to Lynda Kavanagh on her doorstep.Afterwards Machedo sets out the approach. “If they are undecided, we will explain and tell them the reality so they now all the facts.”Flynn adds that “12 weeks resonates with a lot of people”.While there were shoals of No supporters, one wonders from listening to the uncertainty of a minority of householders if there is a silent Yes vote, just as No campaigners claim there is a silent No vote in Dublin.Asked if she feels herself isolated in Sinn Féin, Nolan says: “At the minute I am focused on the referendum. I am acting on my conscience and my beliefs. My beliefs are very strongly pro-life.“I do hope there is space given to republicans like myself who would be also strongly pro-life.”Nolan says she has been contacted by many members who support her view and she is glad at what she is doing. “The Proclamation says we must cherish all the children equally and I feel that is what I am doing, as a republican, as an Irish woman and as a mother.”Asked if the party is not minded to give members like her a free vote in the future, she deflects a little.“I have not come to that point yet. I have been so busy supporting the No campaign.“I am just working in the here and now. I would be hopeful that there will be a vote of conscience. I think there is a need for a free vote. As republicans we need that space.”Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/27/TELEMMGLPICT000147769149_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"behind shutterpatricia de melo moreira photographing portugals","story":"A wildfire is reflected in a stream at Penela, during Portugal\u0026#39s deadly \u0026#39dark summer\u0026#39, on June 18, 2017In the summer of 2017 catastrophic wildfires claimed more than 100 lives and 44,969 hectares of Portuguese land.Photographer Patricia de Melo Moreira witnessed and recorded the beginning of that dark summer, when the first fire in Pedrógão Grande started spreading to neighbouring areas including Góis, Pampilhosa da Serra and Arganil. De Melo Moreira, whose work earned her the first prize of the Estacao Imagem de Coimbra festival, told The  about what it was like to cover the deadliest wildfires in her country\u0027s history: Professionally and emotionally, I will never forget it.It started with a very long working day in Lisbon. On June 17, 2017 De Melo Moreira was photographing the gay pride parade for AFP, with temperatures reaching 42C in the capital.A villager of Sanguinheira stands in front of the gate of her house as a wildfire approaches the village in Macao, central Portugal, on July 25During the parade I had mentioned to my colleagues about the possibility of that weather conditions could trigger wildfires. So at the end of the parade we said we will keep in touch if we knew of anything.Later that night a colleague from another agency called me saying there was a wildfire blazing at Pedrógão Grande. The number of victims at that point was already 29, a number that would later increase. De Melo Moreira set off with a colleague late in the evening. The crew did not stop until the early hours of  June 19.The news of the spreading wildfires and the growing death tolls quickly caught the attention of international media. The demand for information was huge, the Lisbon-based photographer says.A firefighter stands in the middle of a road near flames blazing near the village of Sanguinheira, in Macao, central Portugal, on July 25The team carried on for four days through the exhaustion of working under high temperatures, intense smoke and long hours. Emotionally we were facing the tragedy and despair of people who lost their family and friends but also their houses and belongings, we had to continue working, De Melo Moreira said.An estimated 64 people died during those four days, almost all of them were killed in their cars as they tried to flee the flames.The coverage of a wildfire is very intense, especially when we have a huge demand to send over the story as fast as we can and we are working in extreme conditions, De Melo Moreira told The .When it comes to the dangers associated with this type of story, the photographer told The  that she takes precautions, such as never going alone to a fire and always letting the firefighters know where she is. I get close enough but not so close that I put myself in danger. I really respect the power of nature and I already know how unpredictable a wildfire can be.Isabel Godinho, 63, cries inside her burnt garage at Vilas de Pedro, Figueiro dos Vinhos, on June 19Photographing the aftermath, however, can be the hardest part of the job. Capturing all the damage and destruction in people’s lives can be the most difficult, I had to turn away to hold back my tears many times. Some stories aren’t photographable, I just hear them and picture them in my head, and incredible as it may be those images will form in my head in the end of the day when I’m alone in the hotel room and I can’t fall asleep.Between June and October, the driest summer in nearly 90 years, hundreds of fires raged across northern and central Portugal.Firefighters tackle a wildfire close to the village of Pucarica in Abrantes on August 10I covered most of the major wildfires in the centre of the country, it was extremely difficult to cover so many blazing at the same time, the photographer told The .The 2017 bushfires burnt a record 520,000 hectares of forest, an area 52 times the size of Lisbon and representing nearly 60 per cent of the total area burnt in the entire EU that year. That compares with an annual average of just over 83,000 hectares between 2008 and 2016.The last summer in Portugal was completely different from any other summer in the past years, it was a dark summer, De Melo Moreira said.  Forest rangers watch smoke rising from a wildfire in Gois, Coimbra district, on June 20The number of victims, injured, houses destroyed and territory burnt are incomparable. In my opinion it has to do with climate change. We are experiencing an increase in heatwaves in recent summers, very dry weather and strong winds and that leads to more deadly and devastating wildfires. Constança Urbano de Sousa, whose interior ministry was in charge of firefighting, resigned in October after facing public criticism over her handling of the fires. The government also came close to falling.Asked whether she feels that Portugal will be better prepared this year, De Melo Moreira is not optimistic.A wildfire at Vale de Abelha village in Macao, on August 16I hope my country is better prepared but I think the prevention will take more than a year to get set up.The magnitude of the disaster is believed to have been the result of a perfect storm of extreme weather conditions, bad forest management, a deficient communication system and arson.The forest management will take years to be amended, instead of growing high flammable but profitable trees like eucalyptus and pine trees we need to find other species that can contain the fires when they start.More than 90 percent of Portugal\u0027s 30,000 firefighters are volunteers and their equipment is bought with public donations.Portuguese firefighters have all the heart and bravery needed but clearly when Portugal is facing this problem every summer we need to have a specialised professional force.Behind the ShutterPlease review our commenting policyFall Army Worm: On the march to Britain, the deadly pest that devastated swathes of AfricaDonald Trump poised to ignore allies and scrap Iran nuclear dealInnocent boy, 13, returning from wedding shot in drug deal that went wrong in violent Bank Holiday weekendMet Gala 2018: stars glitter on the red carpet at fashion\u0026#39s OscarsOxford armed stand-off ends after shootout between police and gunmanRail bosses admit it\u0026#39s cheaper to split tickets as they promise to overhaul confusing systemComment: The nightingale\u0026#39s song is being drowned out... by a cacophony of other birdsDonald Trump to announce Iran nuclear decision on Tuesday as Boris Johnson warns him not to \u0026#39throw the baby out with the water\u0026#39How Iran will look to reshape the Middle East if the nuclear deal unravelsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?American boy wakes up after being declared brain deadDonald Trump tells voters to reject \u0026#39Trumpier than Trump\u0026#39 Republican maverickMidsomer Murders only has equal opportunities killers, star saysJohn Motson\u0026#39s 50-year career to be celebrated by BBC with \u0026#39special emoji\u0026#39Inheritance tax frightens people and will be examined to see if it is \u0026#39fit for purpose\u0026#39, says Treasury adviserMelania Trump steps into the limelight with \u0026#39Be best\u0026#39 campaign for childrenWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/07/TELEMMGLPICT000162566616_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqw7JM-cufCMwYWNDKKvtMzqY8BitGG0MXDquLbqzt838.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"british man weds bride days saving life crocodile bit arm","story":"Englishman Jamie Fox married Zanele Ndlovu in Zimbabwe this weekend despite his bride being attacked by a crocodile several days beforeA British man has described the moment he desperately fought to save his fiancee as her arm was bitten off by a crocodile, five days before they got married.Jamie Fox, 27, wed Zanele Ndlovu in a Zimbabwean hospital. In one week we went from shock and agony to a truly amazing experience, he said.Fox and his then fiancée, Miss Ndlovu, 25, were canoeing in an inflatable boat on the Zambezi, one of Africa\u0027s longest rivers, when they were attacked by a crocodile on April 30.Mr Fox managed to pull his fiancee, a former national tennis player, back out of the water and applied a makeshift tourniquet, but she had lost so much blood it was feared that she may die from the wound.I was shouting, trying to save her,” he said. “She was not complaining of pain when we managed to pull her out of the water, maybe because of the shock. We were hoping the doctors would save her arm but that was not to be.Doctors were unable to save Zenele Ndlovu\u0026#39s right armMiss Ndlovu was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo but lost her right arm and suffered injuries to her left hand.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

You’re at a party. You know no one but the host and they’ve had to rush to the kitchen to rescue some smoking vol-au-vents from the oven. You spot a friendly looking fellow guest, also on their own, and sidle over to make their acquaintance by the buffet table. You swap names. You compare notes on your respective journeys to the venue. You talk about the weather. Hasn’t it been strange this year? So far so good. Now what?The host passes by with those vol-au-vents. You grab one and shove it in your mouth. And before you’ve entirely finished eating it you come out with the line, “So, what do you do?”If this were the 1970s, the needle would skitter across the vinyl on the record player, bringing the music to an abrupt and ugly end. As it is, the entire room falls silent as everyone turns to stare.The etiquette guide to Whatsapp group chatsIt’s not that your mouth is still full of vol-au-vent crumbs. Though that is pretty disgusting. It’s because they’re thinking: “You just asked what?”You just asked somebody what they do? Quelle horreur. You thought you were making small talk but you’ve accidentally outed yourself as being a bit of a prat.           I had no idea you weren’t supposed to ask people “what they do” until I was about 35 and I read an article by one of those etiquette gurus who if he had any real manners, wouldn’t spend so much time pronouncing on other people’s. It shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. I was sure I had asked that question on many occasions. I’d certainly answered it. Did people think I was an ill-mannered oaf? The etiquette expert did not, alas, go into the reasons for his pronouncement and I was left none the wiser.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent awkward conversationsSo why don’t people like being asked what they do?Maybe it’s because the rest of the question, which generally remains unspoken, is “for a living”. “What do you do for a living?” Already sounds a bit worse, doesn’t it? A bit too personal? Once you know what someone does to get by, it can immediately change your perception of that person. Maybe you were starting to fancy them, but now you know they’re an actuary? Too dull. Or a social worker? Too poor. Or a stay-at-home mum? Oh no. You’ll have to talk about nappies all night.Before you know it, you lazily start to project the cliched characteristics of the occupation onto your new friend and in doing so fail to give yourself a chance to get to know them in any real way. They’ve already been labelled and put in the appropriate box.  Likewise, there’s always the danger that when you tell someone what you do for a living, they’ll have further questions you should actually be charging to answer.Doctors have all experienced the horror of being whisked away from the table at a dinner party to take a quick look at someone’s rash. Lawyers are asked to comment on orce cases at wedding receptions. Plumbers are suddenly handed toilet plungers instead of another glass of champagne.   Everything you need to know about dating app etiquetteNovelists have it worst of all. It’s my experience that upon hearing I’m a novelist (having already worked out that I’m not JK Rowling or EL James), nine out of 10 people want to tell me about the book they’re writing. Could I show it to my publisher? Or they’ll tell me about a story they have that’s just bound to be a bestseller only they don’t have time to write it themselves. Perhaps I could write it for them and they’ll give me 10 per cent of the proceeds? Does that sound reasonable? Only once in my 20-year career has a complete stranger ever told me a story that made me want to reach for my pen.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent those awkward conversations, so I do understand why “what do you do” can be a loaded question.But let’s be realistic. It’s not easy to make small talk with a stranger. I would never cut someone dead or judge their social standing just because they’d resorted to the easy questions on a first encounter. Sometimes you really don’t know what else to say. Modern conversation is a veritable minefield. It used to be that you should never talk about religion or politics but the list of subjects that are verboten seems to grow by the day. We can’t all talk about the weather until the end of time. Though having said that, hasn’t the weather been strange?If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with ‘I’m a water slide tester’.When I said I was going to be writing about the questions we just can’t ask each other, because they’re considered impolite or because they’re actually illegal (such as “how old are you” in certain contexts), a friend of mine agreed with the etiquette expert that asking “what do you do” was the very height of bad manners. My friend would admit to having asked the question only once so far as he could remember, saying that he’d deployed it in desperation at a fancy dinner party. His neighbour at the table was monosyllabic. The conversation was going absolutely nowhere so my friend dropped the “wdyd” bomb thinking that at least if he found out his neighbour was an accountant, they could talk about taper relief.“I’m a drummer,” said the man.“In your spare time?”Apparently the conversation didn’t pick up after that.So, what can you ask instead? A better question is perhaps, “What do you do in your free time?” Whereas people often have to work at jobs they hate just to pay the mortgage, what they do in their free time should, by definition, be something they simply enjoy. Maybe the actuary you’ve already dismissed as boring is passionate about the Argentine tango, imbuing every step with the spirit of the brave and unruly gaucho. They might have danced you into bed. So ask what someone loves to do before you ask them what they have to do. Whether the answer is “needlework, specifically cross-stitch” or “attending furring conventions in the New Forest dressed a hamster”, there’s got to be at least 10 minutes more conversation to be had.Eleven etiquette rules to remember next time you flyMan who studied rich people found 3 etiquette aspects they never shirkEtiquette coach prompts outrage by claiming Christmas tinsel is commonIf you say these 28 words, you\u0027re poshA pool etiquette guide for mothers braving a family holidayMeanwhile, the perfect response to “what do you do” has to be “what do I do about what?” If you’re feeling mean, that is. If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with “I’m a water slide tester”. It’s an actual job. You have to rate theme park water slides for exhilaration and splash factor. You just need to be able to swim. Imagine what’ll go through your new friends’ minds when they hear that’s what you get up to all day. Interestingly, despite the etiquette snob’s assertion that enquiring after someone’s occupation marks you out as not being from “the top drawer” as it were, I’ve heard that when they’re meeting people in those interminable line-ups, the Royals always ask “and what do you do?”I wonder if anyone has ever asked the same question in return?*Of course he wasn’t in U2.

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of material to watch can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first s, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxys of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead into Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 14)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, s of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Jessica Jones season three, and New Warriors season one.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Well, enough is enough.”Former education secretary Justine Greening accused Brexiteers of acting like Russia at the UN by “vetoing things the don’t like”.Tory veteran Nicholas Soames also called for the “holding to ransom of the PM” by the pro-Brexit European Research Group, an influential wing of Eurosceptic backbench MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, to end.The decision on the government’s preferred customs option has been postponed after senior ministers failed to reach agreement over whether to go for Ms May’s customs partnership or the so-called maximum facilitation model favoured by Eurosceptics, which relies on technology to minimise border checks.The prime minister has risked Brexiteer anger by reportedly telling colleagues that they could be forced by parliament to accept a full customs union with the EU if they did not support her compromise plan.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13Her ally Mr Clark, the business secretary, insisted the plan was still on the table in an appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, where he warned that thousands of jobs could be put at risk at manufacturing firms such as car giant Toyota, if extra customs checks are brought in.However Mr Rees-Mogg, a prominent Eurosceptic, dismissed the warnings as “Project Fear” and said that the customs partnership plan would amount to keeping the UK in the EU.The Brexit war cabinet is due to meet on Thursday, while Ms May also faces a crucial Lords vote this week, where rebel Tories believe they have enough support for plans to effectively keep Britain in the single market.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian police carrying struggling opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the more things change, the more they stay the same\u0026nbspLebanon is a colourful place at the moment. Spring has been unusually warm the hillsides above Beirut are green and the pink and purple blossom of bougainvillea and jacaranda trees drift down onto the city’s streets.  The plethora of new political flags and posters, however, is definitely more eye-catching.  On Sunday Lebanon’s erse population of six million will cast their votes for the first time since 2009 in a national election which should end almost a decade of political gridlock.Lebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri says resignation on hold awaiting talksThe new elections come with a set of complicated new rules designed to move Lebanon towards a proportionally representative system for the first time, allowing space for more independents and reducing the power of establishment blocs formed by the country’s multiconfessional political system.Critics, however, say that since the new electoral law asks voters to pick lists of allied sects and parties, as well as prioritise inidual candidates on the list of their choice, it accentuates the already isive tendencies of Lebanon’s complex politics by making candidates on the same slates compete with each other. “Like almost every law on the books in Lebanon, the way it looks on paper is very different to how it is applied or fairly administered in practice,” said Imad Salameh, a professor of politics at Beirut’s Lebanese American University. “We are injecting into the normal proportional system this Lebanese twist. Parliament is unlikely to change too much. But it is a step in the right direction.”Lebanon’s politics – which involves 18 officially represented sectarian groups – is famously complicated. The filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesThe filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesIn the Christian villages just below the cedar forests of north Lebanon’s Tannourine, huge posters of the Christian president, Michel Aoun, are currently hung underneath tens of Shia Hezbollah’s distinctive yellow flag, green fists brandishing AK-47s.  Some of the country’s more surprising political partnerships – such as that of the recently elected Mr Aoun and Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri – say a lot about how Lebanon’s internal politics are still intrinsically linked to its position in the region and the Middle East’s wider power struggles. Lebanese media has been dominated in recent weeks by pundits angry that the country’s biggest issues – the heavily indebted economy, the disarmament of Hezbollah, Syrian refugees and crises in public services such as electricity and garbage – have for the most part been sidelined by the major parties, who are too preoccupied with forging allegiances to maintain the status quo to assure voters they will do what’s best for the country.Analysts believe that the reaction of Iran and the administration of US President Donald Trump – both of which have proxy interests in Lebanon – will depend on other events across the region.“The problem is, the Trump administration and Iran will treat the election results depending on so many other factors,” said Mohaned Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre. US pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisThe Boustani house encompasses both the tragedy and faith of LebanonSaudi Arabia has threatened Lebanese stability in the past“There’s so much happening in May in the region alone. We will still be counting the votes, probably, when Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, and Iraq holds its own elections, which may change a lot in the Shia power balance there. “Our future is dependent on many variables outside our control.”The rest of the Middle East casts a long shadow on the tiny country. Internally, so do ongoing rows over gerrymandering, conflicts of interest, party funding and the steep cost for independents for running a slate.Despite all that, however, there is still a sense of optimism among many young people in Lebanon – 800,000 of whom are excited to cast a vote for the first time. Art exhibition in Lebanon shut down by people trying to erase imperialism from their historyA record number of women are running this year and civil society movements aimed at educating people about their democratic rights are flourishing. “The best way of looking at these elections is: they are an exercise for the new blood in Lebanese politics and new candidates and movements popping up everywhere to try contest the sectarian establishment and elite,” said Mr Ali. “It is building up some sort of new independent movement for the next round. It’s a long process, and there’s a long way to go.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We hope the PM and her ­europhile backbench rebels realise it.Some half-baked customs compromise, or another forced on it by a ­Commons vote, will be a knife to the Government’s jugular and hand Ukip an unlikely route back from the dead.Some argue that voters couldn’t care less about the customs union. But wait till they realise that staying in one ends our newly-won independence as a  trading nation and locks us for ever into voiceless subservience to the EU.Brexit voters would be merciless.So Mrs May MUST heed her Cabinet Brexiters over her Remainer aides, dump her foolish “customs partnership” fudge and face her rebels down.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling?

Women lack an enzyme in their stomach that breaks down alcohol into a safer compound.This is a mess, this is somebody who probably died of cirrhosis.What happens is not only are you unable to take toxins out of your system, which affects your brain - whats called encephalitic - but you cant build proteins.Your immune system doesnt work properly.And blood backs up behind the liver, building varicose veins in your oesophagus.They can rupture and you can bleed to death in minutes.The liver is the largest organ inside the body, and has around 500 different roles.It breaks down food into energy, helps the body get rid of dangerous waste products and toxins, and helps the immune system fight infections.Drinking alcohol increases your risk of liver disease, according to Drinkaware.Their website states: Drinking alcohol...can cause irreparable damage to this very important part of your body.In fact, alcohol is a major cause of the 25 per cent increase in deaths from liver disease in England over the last decade (from 9,231 in 2001 to 11,575 in 2009).There are two types of liver disease, acute - when it happens quickly over a few months - and chronic, where the damage is caused over a number of years.Cirrhosis is a chronic condition, that builds up over time.Earlier symptoms that could be a sign of cirrhosis include:Scientists dont know for sure why boozing harms the liver.But they have two theories.The first is that it causes oxidative stress, the chemical reaction that happens when the liver tries to break down alcohol.This damage can cause inflammation and scarring as the liver tries to repair itself.And the second way is to do with toxins in gut bacteria.Alcohol can damage our intestines, which lets toxins from the gut bacteria get into the liver.These toxins can also trigger inflammation and scarring, which in turn damages the liver.To find out more visit Drinkawares website here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that is exactly what it is doing.”Last month, it emerged that thousands of families could get a massive benefits boost after the rules on Universal Credit changed.The limit on child benefit will no longer apply to families who adopt children or look after relatives.The U-turn from the Government comes after a High Court judge ruled ministers were breaching human rights laws.Currently, a family can only claim cash for their first two children - not for the third or any more.But if a family with two children goes on to adopt another, they are entitled to an increase in benefits.Miss McVey announced that from now on, the same rule will apply to all families with adopted kids - even if they adopted a child first, then had a biological third child later.The rule change also apply to people who look after their relatives children.But it will not apply to stepchildren as long as they are still living with one of their biological parents.It will bring a boost of £231.67 per child for every Universal Credit claimant affected.Some parents could get even more if they qualify for top-up payments because of low earnings."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004040818031.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=720\" height=\"960","title":"trenton mckinley alabama back to life","story":"The young lad from Mobile, Alabama, fractured his skull in seven places after an accident playing with a trailer.

Campaigners fear the “draconian” move would hamper investigative journalism, meaning dodgy business chiefs and cheating MPs could avoid exposure. The bid, led by Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson, comes on Wednesday when MPs debate the Data Protection Bill’s latest stages. Most national newspap\u0026shy\u0026shyers, including the Mirror, are signed up to Independent Press Standards Organisation, free from Gov\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shyernment interference. But Jodie Ginsberg, of free speech group Index on Censorship, warned how the Bill would punish publishers who are not members of the state-backed regulator Impress.  Ministers had refused to implement Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act, which has the same effect. Ms Ginsberg said: “Lords and MPs have sought to use this Bill as a way of sneaking back into law restrictions on the Press that the Government has said it will not implement, namely forcing any publisher who refuses to sign up to a state-backed regulator to pay the legal costs of any data protection case brought against them, even if they win.”  She added in The Independent that people may avoid exposure, “including cases in which exposure, such as the Windrush scandal, is in the public interest”, by threatening legal action. Mr Watson has been blasted for accept\u0026shy\u0026shying \u0026pound540,000 in donations from ex-F1 boss Max Mosley, a privacy campaigner since being exposed for an S\u0026ampM orgy with prostitutes. He funds Impress via an arms-length charity, giving nearly \u0026pound4million. Mr Watson last night insisted he had campaigned against Press intrusion since the phone hacking scandal emerged. He said: “All parties promised that the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry would be implemented. That is what these amendments do.

Mark and his son Luke, 20, had been to a Courteeners gig at Manchester Arena in April. After several hours of being on his feet, Mark was in pain and Luke was helping him walk.  Mark said: “Going to a gig is a big deal for me. A friend bought the tickets for myself and my son as a Christmas present, he didn’t think about seating, and the huge amount of standing involved due to the extra security measures. “As the concert went on the pain got worse and I needed to sit down. Luke had to help me walk as the pain was so bad. But as we got to the pub the bouncer put his hand up in my face straight away and said ‘you’re not coming in, you’re drunk’. “I explained I had a false leg and have issues with my other leg due to the strain it is put under. I also explained I had only had one drink and begged them to let me sit down. But he was really aggressive towards me. I lost my leg in an accident 20 years ago and have never been treated like this before.

Brits flocked to parks yesterday as The Met Office confirmed this year\u0027s early May bank holiday weekend as officially the hottest on record, and temperatures passed 28C.   But it\u0027s bad news for Brits as low pressure will push aside the warmth in favour of more wet and windy weather.  By midweek, the jet stream will have moved further south allowing cooler, more unsettled conditions to move across the country. The drop will start to be felt tomorrow when the mercury will struggle to reach the low teens compared to the high 20s enjoyed yesterday.  Met Office Forecaster Helen Roberts said highs of 28C (82.4F) were expected today, with the south east and central southern England seeing the warmest conditions, followed by a massive drop in temperature as the week progresses. She told the Press Association: Much of England will have a really decent morning, lots of sunshine. It gradually clouds over across West Midlands into the early afternoon, but central and eastern areas tend to hold onto the sunshine for longer.  The warm weather might trigger thunderstorms later this afternoon and into the evening, most likely in East Anglia, London and the south east, the Met Office said. It will start to feel fresher and rain will spread eastwards from the Atlantic across Wales, the north-west, south-west England and the West Midlands. Conditions are expected to remain dry, sunny and very warm for a short time further south and east but it won’t be long before the unsettled conditions take charge across the whole of the country. By tomorrow it will be fresher everywhere with broken cloud and some sunshine, but further rain will reach western and northern areas during the day. Rain will edge across the rest of the UK during the night to leave a day of sunshine and scattered showers on Thursday. It will then become more changeable, with the north and west likely to see strong winds and spells of rain or showers at times, whilst the east has the best of the drier and brighter spells.

It was approached by a covered bridge, leading down a wide staircase to a spacious booking hall. The broad, sweeping platforms a quarter of a mile long could take 18-coach trains. The waiting room had a cheery coal fire, and there were always porters to help passengers. There were ornate refreshment rooms. Normanton station was a Victorian marvel. And now gone, all gone, except for a short section of platform and a bus-stop shelter for the infrequent stoppers to Leeds. The buildings were demolished, post-Beeching. No more Thames-Clyde expresses, or “all stations to Manchester Victoria”.  The station was once the heart and soul of a community, a place of bustle, business, comings and goings to far-off places. Of romance, even. It was no coincidence that Brief Encounter, that most English of romantic movies, was filmed around a station, Carnforth, where Scots flyers thundered through. Today’s stations are either soulless halts or shopping centres from which trains are reluctantly permitted to depart. They bear testimony to the age of coffee shop chains and fashion boutiques. Perhaps this is what travellers want. A Transport Focus survey makes revamped Birmingham New Street the third-best station in the country – the final triumph of retail over railway. There are dozens of shops selling things I don’t want to buy, but the trains still go from cramped, chilly, underground platforms with nowhere to sit and bewildered passengers milling about trying to find escape routes. Kings Cross in London was the most-liked. It may be an architectural masterpiece, but it’s junk if you are on a journey. Not enough seats, and crowds staring miserably at a monster departure board that barely gives you enough time to catch your train.  Maybe that’s because privatised operators are in cahoots with retailers to keep us herded into the shopping precinct. St Pancras is rated second-best. Have you ever tried getting through the wheelie-suitcase warriors there? Lucky to escape with no more than a bruised shin. And don’t try to find the local services. They are in another place altogether, with fewer shops because commuters don’t have time to buy the chainstore rubbish on sale to Eurostar travellers. Give me an honest-to-goodness station where the trains are more important than “the retail experience”. A station like Grade 1-listed Huddersfield, whose classical facade makes the proudest architectural statement on the system.  It has two pubs, proper boozers with proper beer and railway paintings on the wall and drinkers who look as if they might be going to Newcastle (another great station). And there is a station cat. Stations are – or should be – places of glamour. I like to land in magnificent Bristol Temple Meads knowing I could go to Bodmin, Dawlish, Abergavenny, Ludlow, Haverfordwest or Great Malvern. But not Cardiff, which is not the station of a nation. Or back to bloody New Street. Or Derby – characterless despite a makeover. No, give me the great shambles that is Preston. Or Hull Paragon, which just about manages to retain some of the virtues from which it takes its name. Or Glasgow Central, a real terminus, the end of the line from England - now the only one since the closure of Buchanan Street and St Enoch (the site of a huge shopping centre: an honest transformation, at least).

It is expected to fetch \u0026pound250,000, even though fixing ripped seats and restoring the 64-year-old car, one of only 16 made, will costs tens of thousands more. The car, which will be sold in London, has been owned by classic car collector Marvin Biren since 1962 when he paid \u0026pound1,700 for it. He used it for 15 years until a house move in 1977 meant he had to put it in storage - and it has remained there ever since.

Excitement about the royal wedding has grown ever since it was first announced the pair were engaged last year.   But with Harry and his actress fiancee\u0027s nuptials fast approaching, it wasn\u0027t until last week that it was finally confirmed that Meghans dad Thomas Markle Snr will walk her down the aisle .  The 73-year-old will attend the ceremony with Meghan\u0027s mum, his ex-wife, Doria. However, despite his daughter\u0027s celebrity and soon-to-be royal status, her dad prefers to live a reclusive life. So with the royal wedding fast approaching, here is what you need to know about the father of the bride. How many children does Thomas Markle Snr have?  Thomas W Markle has three children, of which Meghan is the youngest.  He met the Suits actress\u0027 mum, Doria Ragland , in the late 1970s and the pair welcomed her to the world in August 1981.  Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Jnr, who are the children of Thomas Snr\u0027s first marriage to Roslyn Loveless.   However. Meghan has a frosty relationship with her half-brother and half-sister, who have been repeatedly outspoken about her. Thomas Snr and Doria divorced in 1987 after which Meghan lived with her mum. What is Thomas Markle Snr\u0027s job?  Like his daughter Meghan, Thomas Snr also works in the film and television industry. But while the royal bride-to-be\u0027s best work takes place in front of a camera, her father has built a career behind the scenes. He is a former television lighting director and can boast iconic US shows on his CV including Married with Children and General Hospital.  And his career hasn\u0027t been without recogntion. In 2011 he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Lighting Direction for a Drama Series for his work on General Hospital.  Before Meghan was born he was claimed to a 75-hours-a-week workaholic .  His son, Thomas Jnr, revealed: When Meggie was born, Dad was a completely changed man. Before then, Dad’s work took priority over everything, but she became his whole world. “She was her Daddy’s princess.” Where does Thomas Markle Snr live?  After his career in Hollywood, Thomas Markle Snr moved to Mexico where he lives near Rosarito Beach.  Last year he broke his silence about his daughter\u0027s wedding when the Mirror caught up with him near his home.  At the time, the 73-year-old shared his hopes of walking his daughter down the aisle. He had moved to his new home from Los Angeles after declaring himself bankrupt in California, with credit car debts of \u0026pound24,180. But despite his apparent financial struggles, Thomas Jr, said he is by no means broke. What is his life like?  Before he spoke to the Mirror last December, there was much speculation about Mr Markle\u0027s reclusive lifestyle. Very few people actually knew where he lived in Mexico. He drives a blue Chrysler PT Cruiser and has access to a \u0026pound1,307 monthly pension. Thomas Jnr said his father preferred to shun the spotlight after his daughter\u0027s high profile engagement. “Dad never liked the limelight, but since the news came out about Meghan and Harry, he’s become a total recluse, he said. He hates the attention Meghan’s romance has brought on to him. He loves her, but hates the idea of being in the spotlight.” His former neighbour from Rancho Del Mar also told the Daily Mirror: “Tom would always keep himself to himself, but he was also very polite and would say hello. “We would see him pottering around and he would often pop to Walmart or Home Depot. “He didn’t appear to be hiding from anyone, but where we live is very secluded. We didn’t even know he had a daughter, let alone she was marrying a British prince.” Did Thomas Markle Snr win the lottery?   When Meghan was a child, her father won \u0026pound560,000 in the lottery enabling him to provide her with a great education, according to Thomas Jnr.

British bridegroom Jamie Fox and his bride-to-be were canoeing in the Zambezi river above the Victoria Falls when the giant beast struck from below. Former national tennis player Zanele Ndlovu had her right arm torn off and her left hand bitten in the vicious attack.  Jamie went to her rescue and managed to save her but she was losing so much blood it was feared she may die from the wound. A family friend said: During the attack the crocodile gripped her arm and ripped it off while her partner made frantic efforts to save her. They are lucky to be alive. “The boats used in that activity are inflated and the crocodile attacked their vessel and in the process deflated it before attacking her.  A make-shift tourniquet was applied and she was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to save her life but she lost most of her arm. Incredibly despite her horrific injuries she was determined not to miss her wedding day and was allowed to use the hospital chapel to get married. A Minister presided over the ceremony at the Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo where the remarkable service took place on Sunday. It is believed the couple had gone to the Victoria Falls to get married but the crocodile attack meant a drastic change of venue was needed. The bride can be seen in her white sleeveless wedding dress walking into church with her stump heavily bandaged, holding pink roses in her left hand.  As Jamie places the wedding ring on her left hand a canula can be seen attached to her wrist and her hand is also heavily bandaged. When she signed the register, a huge round of applause broke out from family and friends. A witness said: It is a quite remarkable love story and it really does show their love for each other. The crocodile attack made no difference. “Their feelings and love for each other are even stronger than before if anything. A short video clip from the ceremony shows the emotional moment the groom kisses the bride.

Homes have burned since the Kilauea volcano erupted on Thursday, and authorities have issued a fresh warning calling on people to leave after a new fissure opened. Deadly sulphur dioxide gases have prompted alarm in the east of the Big Island, which is home to around 200,000 people. So far 26 homes have been destroyed since the island suffered its largest earthquake in decades, but no one has been reported dead or seriously injured. Authorities confirmed that 1,700 people have evacuated from their homes.  Evacuees from Leilani Estates - one of the worst areas affected - were allowed to return for pets, medications and to check property on Sunday. Jeremy Wilson found his home surrounded by fissures hundreds of feet long. My house is right in the middle, said Wilson, a 36-year-old social worker who turned back when he saw steam coming from cracks in the road.  Early this, 161 people were housed at two shelters on the island, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said. The semi-rural wooded area of Leilani Estates had become a magnet for newcomers to Hawaii who were prepared to risk living near an active volcano for more affordable real-estate.

Australian Ethan Bramble started changing his body 10 years ago when he got his ears stretched at the age of 11. He hasn\u0027t stopped making alterations since, which he admitted made him appear a weird looking dude. The 21-year-old told Australian media he is often stopped on the street to explain his unique look, especially from women.  But he compared his choices to putting on make-up and painting fingernails. Ethan, who lives on the New South Wales Central Coast, admits he has an obsession with ink having worked in tattoo shops for eight years, and now sports around 150 patterns, including on his eyeballs. And by the time he was 17, Ethan said he started to take an interest in heavy modification because he “liked the way it looks”, Australian media reports.  Procedures Ethan has undergone include a tongue split, nostrils \u0027punched\u0027, where the nose is pierced either side, and having his bellybutton removed, it was reported. Today, Ethan has gained an army of more than 65,000 followers across Facebook and Instagram, with many fans of his manufactured look.  Ethan told Australian media outlet News.au : Girls especially come up to me on the street and ask, \u0027Why? Just why?\u0027 “And I ask, ‘Why do you dye your hair? Why do you put makeup on in the morning, why do you paint your fingernails?’ “It’s the way you want to look, your appearance and I’ve always been a strong believer in you shouldn’t really judge people in the way they look - the end product is 100 per cent worth the torment, if you’re committed to it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"over zealous duty cop pulls","story":"NewsOver zealous off-duty cop pulls gun on man for \u0027stealing\u0027 packet of Mentos - seconds after he paid for themShocking CCTV footage from inside a convenience store show the cop pointing his gun at the clearly terrified shopper\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills22:42, 7 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn off-duty policeman pulled his gun on an innocent shopper he accused of stealing a packet of 88p sweets.

The man, later identified as Jose Arreola, then reaches forward, and in a quick movement puts the packet of $1.19 Mentos into his pocket. Instantly the cop thinks Jose stole the sweets and tells him forcefully to give them back.  Jose tries to explain he paid for them, but the off duty officer pulled his gun. The customer then drops everything on the counter and raises his hands as the cop then grills the shop assistant, to ask if he really did pay. The cop eventually apologises and lets the man take the sweets he had paid for. Speaking to CBS in American, Jose said he wasn\u0027t worried about the gun, but was upset with how the officer spoke to him. He said: The hardest part for me, believe it or not, wasn\u0027t the gun, it was his arrogance, his way of talking to me, he treated me like a piece of trash.

Experts have called for emergency action to cut emissions and use cleaner energy in a bid to save treasured wildlife from destruction. The research predicts affected oceans will warm by 2.8C by 2100. But life in Marine Protected Areas could start becoming extinct as early as 2050. MPAs were set up as havens for threatened species such as polar bears and penguins. But if \u0026shyemissions continue at the rate they are now, the areas will become \u0026shy“uninhabitable” because of a lack of food and living space. Coral reefs also face destruction. Study chief Professor John Bruno, of the University of North \u0026shyCarolina at Chapel Hill, said: “With warming of this \u0026shymagnitude, we expect to lose many, if not most, animal species from Marine Protected Areas by the next century. “To avoid the worst outcomes, we need to immediately adopt an emission reduction scenario in which emissions peak within two decades then decrease, replacing fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources like solar and wind.” "}]
